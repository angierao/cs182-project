How are you, Donald?,1
Thank you, Lester.,0
Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.,1
Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,1
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.,1
They're going to Mexico.,0
First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.,1
They're going to many other countries.,0
I want us to invest in you.,1
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0
They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.,0
I want us to invest in your future.,1
That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.,1
And we have a very good fight.,0
And we have a winning fight.,0
We also have to make the economy fairer.,1
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.,1
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,1
If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.,1
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,1
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,1
Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.,0
So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.,1
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,1
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.,0
How are we going to do it?,1
When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.,0
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,1
They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.,0
Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.,1
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,1
With the United States, as he said, not so much.,0
So Ford is leaving.,0
You see that, their small car division leaving.,0
You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.,1
Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.,0
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,1
They're all leaving.,0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0
As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.,0
We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.,0
Well, I think that trade is an important issue.,1
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,0
Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.,1
We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.,0
And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.,1
We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.,1
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,1
In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.,1
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0
They left -- fired 1,400 people.,0
They're going to Mexico.,0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0
I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.,1
We cannot let it happen.,0
That is not how we grow the economy.,1
We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.,1
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,1
Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.,0
I understand that.,1
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.,1
He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.,1
I don't buy that.,1
I have a different experience.,1
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0
My father was a small-businessman.,1
He worked really hard.,1
He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.,1
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,0
Companies will come.,0
And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.,1
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,1
Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.,1
They will build.,0
We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.,1
They will expand.,0
New companies will start.,0
And I look very, very much forward to doing it.,0
That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.,1
In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.,1
He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.",1
Well, it did collapse.,1
We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.,0
Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,1
Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0
Five million people lost their homes.,1
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,1
Our country's in deep trouble.,0
We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.,0
They're the best, the best ever at it.,0
What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.,0
So we have to do that.,0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0
And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.,0
Now, we have come back from that abyss.,1
And it has not been easy.,1
So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.,1
Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.,1
They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.,1
Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0
They have a VAT tax.,0
We're on a different system.,0
When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.,0
When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.,0
Take clean energy.,1
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1
When they sell into us, there's no tax.,0
It's a defective agreement.,0
I think it's real.,1
I think science is real.,1
And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.,1
And here's what we can do.,1
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,1
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,1
It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.,0
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?,0
We can build a new modern electric grid.,1
Good.,0
I want you to be very happy.,0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,1
So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.,1
It's very important to me.,0
But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.,0
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0
Well, actually...,1
Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.,1
And I have -- well, not quite that long.,1
The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0
Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...,0
Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.,0
They should have been doing this for years.,0
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,1
What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.,0
We cannot do it any longer, Lester.,0
I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...,1
... million new jobs, a balanced budget...,1
Incomes went up for everybody.,1
Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.,1
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.,1
Will they create jobs in America?,1
Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.,0
The companies are leaving.,0
I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.,0
Will they raise incomes in America?,1
They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.,0
And are they good for our national security?,1
Some of them I voted for.,1
And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.,0
We wish you a lot of luck.,0
The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.,1
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,1
But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.,0
And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.,0
So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.,0
We have to stop them from leaving.,0
And that's a big, big factor.,0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,1
I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.,1
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,1
That's called business, by the way.,0
I did not.,0
We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.,1
When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.,1
I did not.,0
We increased them to China 50 percent.,1
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,1
I do not say that.,0
I do not say that.,0
She talks about solar panels.,0
Well, I've been a senator, Donald...,1
We invested in a solar company, our country.,0
And I have been a secretary of state...,1
And I have done a lot...,1
That was a disaster.,0
They lost plenty of money on that one.,0
Well, that's your opinion.,1
That is your opinion.,1
Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.,0
Our energy policies are a disaster.,0
Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.,0
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,0
Well, that is just not accurate.,1
The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.,0
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,1
He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.,0
So I will tell you this.,0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0
I wrote about that in...,1
And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.,0
No.,1
Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.,1
The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...,1
... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.,1
And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.,0
I wrote about that in my book...,1
... before you even announced.,1
Look, there are differences...,1
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.,0
You've been doing this for 30 years.,0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,0
For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.,0
I will bring -- excuse me.,0
I will bring back jobs.,0
There are...,1
You can't bring back jobs.,0
There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.,1
Yeah, for 30 years.,0
Well, he approved NAFTA...,0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,1
He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.,0
That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.,1
But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,0
But in -- oh, but I do.,1
You haven't done it.,0
You haven't done it.,0
Excuse me.,0
In fact, I have written a book about it.,1
Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.,0
You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.,0
NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.,0
It's called "Stronger Together.",1
You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...,1
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
... or at an airport near you.,1
You were totally in favor of it.,0
But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.,1
Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.,0
But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.,0
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,0
You called it the gold standard.,0
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.,0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,1
So we have a very robust set of plans.,1
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,0
And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.,0
And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.,1
That can't -- that can't be left to stand.,1
I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...,1
Not.,0
So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.,1
So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.,1
Because what I have proposed...,1
So is it President Obama's fault?,0
... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.,1
Is it President Obama's fault?,0
Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?,0
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,1
What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.,1
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,1
Because he's pushing it.,0
But you have no plan.,0
Secretary, you have no plan.,0
Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.,1
No, we're not.,1
That's about all you've...,0
No, we're not.,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,0
That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.,1
I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,0
Why not?,1
You are going to drive business out.,0
Yeah, why not?,1
Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.,0
You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.,1
Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...,1
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.,0
I'm very proud of it.,0
Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.,1
We've looked at your tax proposals.,1
I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.,1
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,0
I happen to support that.,1
I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,1
But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.,1
You've proposed an approach that has a...,1
But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.,0
When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.,0
... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.,1
And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.,0
You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.,0
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,0
And when you look at what you are proposing...,1
... it is...,1
I'm going to cut regulations.,0
I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.,0
Facts.,0
... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.,1
And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.,0
Well, could I just finish -- I think I...,0
I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.,0
Trickle-down did not work.,1
She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,0
It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.,1
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,1
And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.,1
And look at her website.,0
And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.,1
I don't think top-down works in America.,1
You know what?,0
It's no difference than this.,0
I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.,1
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,0
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,1
Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.,1
Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.,1
Just go to her website.,0
For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.,1
You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.,1
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,1
So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?,1
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,0
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,1
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,0
First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.,1
No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.,0
See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.,0
Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.,1
Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.,1
Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.,1
So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.,1
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,0
Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.,0
They're going to expand their companies.,0
They're going to do a tremendous job.,0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,0
And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.,1
And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.,1
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,1
And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.,0
It's a great thing for the middle class.,0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.,0
And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.,0
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,1
So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.,0
And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.,0
Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.,0
And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.,1
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0
And we'll guess.,1
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,1
And here's the thing.,0
Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.,0
But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?,1
Who does he owe money to?,1
I happen to think it's double that.,0
It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.,0
Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.,1
I do.,1
You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.,1
TRUMP:,1
And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.,0
But we have no leadership.,0
And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.,1
But I'm not going to make any excuses.,1
And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.,0
Why not?,0
There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,0
Yes.,0
Then you didn't read it.,0
It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.,1
Who gave it that name?,0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,1
And the other thing I think is important‰Û_,1
The first I've -- who gave it that name?,0
... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.,1
You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.,1
And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.,1
I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.,1
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,1
It's a beautiful facility.,1
It immediately was put to use.,1
How much?,0
And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...,1
How much for my family?,0
Well, to...,1
Lester, how much?,0
Typical politician.,0
All talk, no action.,0
Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?,1
Sounds good, doesn't work.,0
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,1
He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.,1
And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.,1
Never going to happen.,0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,0
Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.,0
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,1
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,0
And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.,0
You call yourself the King of Debt.,1
You talk about leverage.,1
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,1
Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.,1
And we need to be very clear about that.,1
Well, you're right.,1
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,1
We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.,0
Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.,1
And we better be awfully careful.,0
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,0
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,1
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,1
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,1
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.,0
We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.,1
And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.,0
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,0
Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.,1
Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.,1
I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.,0
And it'll be released.,0
So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.,1
And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.,0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,1
But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.,1
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,1
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,1
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.,1
But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.,0
It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.,0
If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.,0
So we have to do two things, as I said.,1
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0
We have to restore trust.,1
When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.,0
We have to work with the police.,1
You know what that is?,0
That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?,0
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,1
And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.,1
Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.,1
You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.,1
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,1
Excuse me.,0
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,1
There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.,1
Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.,1
Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.,0
Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.,0
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,0
I said, do you get audited?,0
It did not do what it needed to do.,1
Now, I believe in community policing.,1
I get audited almost every year.,0
And in a way, I should be complaining.,0
I'm not even complaining.,0
And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.,1
Property crime is down 40 percent.,1
I don't mind it.,0
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,1
It's almost become a way of life.,0
I get audited by the IRS.,0
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,1
But other people don't.,0
But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.,1
I will say this.,0
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,0
I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.,0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,1
As soon as she releases them, I will release.,0
And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.,1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,1
I will release my tax returns.,0
And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, "Don't do it.",0
I will tell you this.,0
We cannot just say law and order.,1
We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.,1
No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.,0
Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.,0
We need to have more second chance programs.,1
When the audit's complete, I'll do it.,0
But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.,0
It's not negotiable, no.,0
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,1
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,1
Let her release the e-mails.,0
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,1
Why did she delete 33,000...,0
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,1
That makes me smart.,0
That was more than a mistake.,0
Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.,1
In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.,1
That was done purposely.,0
OK?,0
That was not a mistake.,0
That was done purposely.,0
We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.,1
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,1
When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.,0
If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.,1
So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.,1
Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.,1
And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.,0
I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.,1
As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.,0
That I can tell you.,0
And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?,1
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0
But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.,1
And you should go down and take a look at that.,0
The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.,0
The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.,0
I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.,1
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,0
The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.,0
And the $650 isn't even on that.,0
But it's not $650.,0
It's much less than that.,0
They admit it's an issue.,1
They've got a lot of concerns.,1
Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.,1
But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.,0
They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.,1
These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.,0
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,1
Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.,1
So there is...,1
I could do that very quickly.,0
No, I'm not.,1
I am very underleveraged.,0
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,1
And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.,1
I have a great company.,0
I have a tremendous income.,0
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0
And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.,1
Look, one murder is too many.,1
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,1
When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.,0
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,1
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,1
You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.,0
So the worst of all things has happened.,0
But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.,1
We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.,0
We haven't even started.,0
And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.,0
Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.,0
And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.,1
Well, I -- I do think...,1
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,1
And it's really a shame.,0
And, yes, I did.,1
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0
Our country has tremendous problems.,0
And you know what else I prepared for?,1
I prepared to be president.,1
And I think that's a good thing.,1
Well, just listen to what you heard.,1
And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.,1
We're a debtor nation.,0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,1
We're a serious debtor nation.,0
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,1
There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.,1
And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.,0
And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.,0
But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.,1
It would be squandered, too, believe me.,0
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,1
Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,0
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,1
Which our country should do, too.,0
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,1
Wrong.,0
You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.,1
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,1
But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.,1
And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.,1
Wrong.,0
Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.,1
So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.,0
Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.,0
I built an unbelievable company.,0
There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,1
But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.,1
Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.,0
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,1
There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.,1
I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...,1
... tough, long game here.,1
It's an unbelievable company.,0
But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.,0
And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.,1
And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.,1
We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.,1
And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.,1
And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.,0
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,1
Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.,0
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,1
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0
My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.,0
And that's what I do.,0
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,1
And the Russians need to understand that.,1
I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.,1
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,1
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,0
That is just unacceptable.,1
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,1
... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,1
I'll give you an example.,0
We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.,0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,1
Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.,1
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,1
It does involve going after them online.,1
But we're opening the Old Post Office.,0
I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.,1
Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.,0
I'm a year ahead of schedule.,0
But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.,1
We're making progress.,1
And that's what this country should be doing.,0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,0
We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.,0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,1
When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.,0
And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.,1
But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.,1
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,0
And we should be able to do that for our country.,0
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,1
I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.,1
And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.,1
Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.,0
Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.,1
Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.,1
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,1
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,1
And we need law and order.,0
He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.,1
If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.,0
And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.,0
I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.,0
But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.,1
We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.,0
We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.,0
You walk down the street, you get shot.,0
In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.,0
Thousands of shootings.,0
And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.,1
But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.,1
And I'm saying, where is this?,0
The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?,1
Is this a war-torn country?,0
What are we doing?,0
That's the most important part of this.,1
And we have to stop the violence.,0
How do we prevent attacks?,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0
How do we protect our people?,1
In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.,0
And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0
Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.,0
I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.,1
You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.,1
And they brought him down.,1
And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.,1
It brought the crime rate way down.,0
So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.,1
That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.,1
We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.,1
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0
We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.,1
And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.,0
And they have guns.,0
Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.,1
They're on the front lines.,1
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,1
And they shoot people.,0
They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.,1
Lester, we've covered...,1
We've covered this ground.,1
And we have to be very strong.,0
Whew, OK.,1
Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.,1
You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.,1
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,1
And we have to be very vigilant.,0
After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.,1
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0
With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.,1
Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.,0
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,1
They had built covert facilities.,1
We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.,0
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,1
And we had sanctioned them.,1
I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.,1
No, you're wrong.,0
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,1
It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.,0
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,1
It was taken away from her.,0
And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.,0
And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.,1
They would have won an appeal.,0
If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.,0
That's diplomacy.,1
That's coalition-building.,1
No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.,0
That's working with other nations.,1
The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.,1
These are felons.,0
He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.,1
That's not good judgment.,1
That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.,1
These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.,0
You need more police.,0
And the worst part...,1
You need a better community, you know, relation.,0
... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,1
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0
It's terrible.,0
He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.,1
He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...,1
... have a good time, folks.,1
I have property there.,0
And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.,1
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,1
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,1
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0
But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.,0
You need better relationships.,0
So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.,1
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0
It's a good one, though.,1
It well describes the problem.,1
You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.,0
Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.,1
Words matter when you run for president.,1
And they really matter when you are president.,1
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,1
But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.,0
It is essential that America's word be good.,1
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,1
So there's some bad things going on.,0
Some really bad things.,0
But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.,0
I've talked with a number of them.,1
And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.,0
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0
Ugh.,0
But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.,1
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,1
I'd like to respond to that.,0
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,1
First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.,0
But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.,1
I agree with you.,0
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,1
Would he have started a war?,1
When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.,0
These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.,0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0
And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.,0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0
Would he have bombed Iran?,1
If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.,1
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,1
He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.,1
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,1
And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.,0
People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.,1
I think you've apologized for it.,0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0
Can they rely on us?,1
And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.,0
Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.,0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,1
And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.,0
That's what I intend to do.,1
I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.,0
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0
I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.,1
It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?,0
But we went from 2,200 to 500.,0
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,1
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,0
... to be given any opportunities at all.,1
Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.,1
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,0
Well, one thing.,1
One thing, Lester.,1
You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.,1
But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...,1
.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,1
Tremendous beyond belief.,0
So when you say it has no impact, it really did.,0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,1
It had a very, very big impact.,0
No, you're wrong.,0
You're wrong.,0
Murders are up.,0
All right.,0
He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.,1
You check it.,0
And he called this woman "Miss Piggy.",1
Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.,1
I'd like to just respond, if I might.,0
I'd just like to respond.,0
I will.,0
Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.,0
Donald, she has a name.,1
Her name is Alicia Machado.,1
They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.,0
And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...,1
The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.,0
... she's going to vote this November.,1
They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.,0
Well, I support our democracy.,1
And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.,1
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,0
And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.,0
You decided to stay home, and that's OK.,0
But I will tell you, I've been all over.,0
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0
But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.,1
And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.,0
I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.,0
And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.,1
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,0
It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.,1
So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.,1
And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.,0
Well, thank you.,1
And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.,0
Are you a teacher?,1
And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.,0
Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.,0
Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.,1
They were pressing it very hard.,0
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,1
And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.,1
We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.,1
She failed to get the birth certificate.,0
When I got involved, I didn't fail.,0
I got him to give the birth certificate.,0
So I'm satisfied with it.,0
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,1
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0
That's why the slogan of my campaign is "Stronger Together," because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.,1
Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.,0
Yeah.,0
If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.,1
So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.,1
Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.,1
I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.,1
Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.,0
I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.,0
I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. ,1
But nobody was caring much about it.,0
Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.,1
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0
You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.,1
Donald Trump is different.,1
And I think I did a good job.,0
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,1
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0
I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.,0
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.,1
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,1
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,1
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,1
Look, it's true.,0
We have seen him insult women.,1
Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.,0
We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.,1
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,1
And she was involved.,0
But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.,0
Well, it was very -- I say nothing.,0
We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.,1
I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.,0
So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.,1
But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.,1
So this is who Donald Trump is.,1
And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.,1
That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. ,1
He should have produced it a long time before.,0
These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.,1
I say nothing.,0
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president. ,1
But let me just tell you.,0
When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.,0
I think you can see that.,0
Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.,1
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0
And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.,0
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,1
Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.,1
I would love to respond.,0
First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.,0
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0
When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.,1
It doesn't work that way.,0
And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.,1
You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.,0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. ,1
I don't think you can deny that.,0
But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.,0
He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.,1
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,1
So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.,0
It really doesn't.,0
He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, "Mexican.",1
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,1
And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.,1
He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. ,1
Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.,0
... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised. ,1
In the first debateÉ,1
We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,0
...,1
I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,1
It was very easy to do.,0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,1
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0
So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.,1
And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.,0
We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,1
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0
Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. ,1
But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?,0
Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.,0
Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.,1
I'll go one step further.,0
Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.,1
In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.,0
I'm not making any excuses.,1
No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.,0
It was a mistake.,1
And I am very sorry about that.,1
And it's a tremendously successful club.,0
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.,1
And I'm so glad I did it.,0
After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.,1
I take classified materials very seriously and always have.,1
When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.,1
And I have been given great credit for what I did.,0
And I'm very, very proud of it.,0
Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.,1
So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.,1
And that's the way I feel.,0
And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands. ,1
Look, it's just not true.,1
And so please, go to... ,1
That is the true way I feel.,0
It was personal e-mails, not official. ,1
Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so... ,1
I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.,0
Yes, that's true, I didn't. ,1
That just happened, and many more are coming.,0
And I'm very proud of it.,0
In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.,0
I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about. ,1
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,0
I was just endorsed by ICE.,0
I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.,0
OK, Donald.,1
I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.,1
So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.,0
OK?,0
Because look at the mess that we're in.,0
Look at the mess that we're in.,0
But let's at least focus... ,1
As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.,0
We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.,0
... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,1
Let's get to their questions.,1
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,0
If he wants to start, he can start.,1
No, go ahead, Donald. ,1
She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.,0
Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.,1
And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.,1
I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.,0
Premiums have gotten too high.,1
Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.,1
But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.,1
But that in and of itself was a good thing.,1
I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.,1
It could also be lots of other people.,0
But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.,1
It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?,0
Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.,1
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0
But what did we learn with DNC?,0
We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.,0
Look what happened to her.,0
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,0
Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.,1
That's what we learned.,0
Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.,0
Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.,1
We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.,0
ISIS.,0
Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.,1
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,1
So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.,0
It is -- it is a huge problem.,0
But we've got to get costs down.,1
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,1
I have a son.,0
But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.,1
And then we would have to start all over again.,1
He's 10 years old.,0
He has computers.,0
Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.,1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country. ,1
He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.,0
The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.,0
So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. ,1
And maybe it's hardly doable.,0
No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.,1
But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.,0
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,0
We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.,0
And it's very clear.,1
Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.,1
Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.,0
But we have an employer-based system.,1
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,0
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,1
And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.,1
Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.,1
"We will take out ISIS.",0
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.,1
Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.,0
And ISIS was formed.,0
And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.,1
So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies... ,1
So she talks about taking them out.,0
She's been doing it a long time.,0
... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma... ,1
... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.,1
So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.,1
That's not going to work. ,1
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,0
But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.,0
Well, thank you for asking your question.,1
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0
Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.,0
And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.,1
And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.,1
And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.,0
I want to say just a couple of things.,1
First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.,1
Wrong.,0
And we've had many successful Muslims.,1
We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali. ,1
My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.,1
That's what America is.,1
Wrong.,0
Wrong.,0
Well, I have to respond.,0
The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.,0
You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.,0
Under your direction, to a large extent.,0
But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.,0
They were choking on the sanctions.,0
And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.,0
But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?,0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,1
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,1
And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.,0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,1
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,1
I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.,1
It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.,1
I did really well.,0
But I have common sense.,0
And I said, well, I'll tell you.,0
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0
But two things.,0
Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?,1
And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.,1
Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.,0
We are not at war with Islam.,1
And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,1
So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. ,1
Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.,0
And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.,0
And I was very strong.,0
And I said it numerous times.,0
Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.,1
But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.,1
There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.,1
And we need to do our part.,1
And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.,0
And I think that's great.,0
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,0
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,1
But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.,1
But I'm all for NATO.,0
But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.,1
But I said they have to focus on terror, also.,0
How do you do that?,1
We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,1
And they're going to do that.,0
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,1
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,1
And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,1
So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,1
And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.,1
And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.,1
We have it on tape.,1
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,0
I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.,0
And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.,0
The entire press corps has looked at it.,1
Not only that, you named the day.,0
It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. ,1
They couldn't believe it.,0
They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.,0
They said...,0
So, please... ,1
... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.,1
No, wait a minute.,0
When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.,0
Well, right.,1
As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called "Lincoln.",1
It should have never happened.,0
Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.,0
But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.,0
It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.,1
Now it's in over 30 countries.,0
And you're going to stop them?,0
I don't think so.,0
It was principled, and it was strategic.,1
I did not support the war in Iraq.,0
That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.,0
Just -- would you like to hear...,0
And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.,1
Wait a minute.,0
And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.,1
That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.,1
But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.,1
I was against the war in Iraq.,0
Just so you put it out.,0
And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.,1
We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.,1
The record does not show that.,0
The record shows that I'm right.,0
When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?,0
Essentially.,0
And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.,1
They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ,1
Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.,1
But we deserve answers.,1
And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has... ,1
... with the Russians and other foreign powers.,1
Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.,1
I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.,1
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,1
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,0
We talked about the economy is more important.,0
I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.,0
But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,1
His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.,1
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,0
And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.,0
Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.,1
And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.,1
And when he -- excuse me.,0
Now, here's what I want to do.,1
I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.,1
And that was before the war started.,0
Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.,0
I was against the war.,0
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,1
He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.,0
And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.,0
And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.,1
But nobody called Sean Hannity.,0
And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.,0
I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.,1
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,1
It's called the Buffett rule.,1
Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.,1
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,1
I think in '04.,0
We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.,1
I want to invest in hard-working families.,1
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,0
And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.,0
And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.,1
And we need to reverse that.,1
People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. ,1
And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country. ,1
But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.,0
Well, here we go again.,1
He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0
I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.,0
I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.,1
But that's not the point here. ,1
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,1
And that's exactly what it's done.,0
I will be the president and we will get it done.,1
It's been a disaster.,0
No, no.,0
That's exactly right.,1
You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.,1
You didn't hear what I said.,0
Look, he has now said repeatedly, "30 years this and 30 years that.",1
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,1
Well, I have much better judgment than she does.,0
I'm very glad to do so.,1
There's no question about that.,0
Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?,0
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,1
After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.,1
I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.,0
I have a winning temperament.,0
I know how to win.,0
Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.,1
She does not have a...,0
When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.,1
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,1
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,1
And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. ,1
Wait.,0
The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.,0
I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.,0
That would not start a war.,0
I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people. ,1
Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.,1
No, they were taunting us.,0
And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.,1
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,1
Wrong.,0
It's lies.,0
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,1
That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.,0
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,1
I would like to...,0
It's not an accurate one at all.,0
It's not an accurate one.,0
So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.,1
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,0
We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.,1
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,1
I agree with her on one thing.,0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,1
The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.,0
Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.,1
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0
And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.,1
I've stood up to Russia.,1
I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.,1
I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.,1
And I did as secretary of state.,1
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,1
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,1
Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.,0
They do not pay us.,0
But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.,0
That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.,0
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,1
I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.,0
But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable. ,1
All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.,0
No, I wasn't.,1
I was gone.,1
I hate to interrupt you, but at some point... ,1
We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...,0
Well, wait, but it's very important.,0
At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here. ,1
All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.,0
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,1
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,1
They have to help us out.,0
As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.,0
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0
Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.,0
I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.,1
But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.,0
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,0
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,1
I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just... ,1
I looked the other night.,0
Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate... ,1
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,1
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,1
I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.,0
And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.,1
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,0
No, he doesn't.,1
There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.,1
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,1
I would go after Baghdadi.,1
I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.,0
I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.,1
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0
I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.,0
So I think that could help.,1
At the same time, we have to be prepared.,0
I would also consider arming the Kurds.,1
The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.,1
I can't take anything off the table.,0
And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq. ,1
Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.,0
Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.,1
Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.,1
You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.,1
China should solve that problem for us.,0
China should go into North Korea.,0
I'm proud of that.,1
You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.,1
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,0
And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.,0
I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.,1
I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.,1
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,0
Iran has power over North Korea.,0
So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.,1
And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.,1
They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.,1
And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.,0
She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,1
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0
He's 10 years old now.,1
This is the only one country he's ever known.,1
And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?,0
And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?,1
You know, children listen to what is being said.,1
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0
One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.,0
To go back to the very, very first question.,1
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0
That turned out to be wrong.,0
It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.,0
And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.,1
Bullying is up.,1
It certainly looks that way.,0
So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?,0
A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.,1
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0
A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.,1
So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. ,1
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0
All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.,0
Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.,1
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0
If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president. ,1
I want to be the best president I can be for every American.,1
Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.,1
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,0
Believe me, he's not a happy camper.,0
Lester, one thing I'd like to say.,0
It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.,1
I will go very quickly.,0
And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.,1
And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.,0
We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.,1
And he is supporting me 100 percent. ,1
Because we talked about what we wanted to do.,1
Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.,0
And it's a big problem.,0
We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates... ,1
No.,1
Well, it's not only my opinion.,1
It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.,1
But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.,1
And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.,0
Everybody.,1
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0
We cannot protect countries all over the world...,0
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,1
... where they're not paying us what we need.,0
And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.,1
He stuck with me.,1
And I have worked and I admire President Obama.,1
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,1
And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.,0
That was a terrible time for our country. ,1
Nine million people lost their jobs.,1
Five million homes were lost.,1
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,1
We are back on the right track.,1
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,1
Thank you.,1
We need heart.,0
Well, you're right.,1
We need a lot of things.,0
This is one of the most important issues in this election.,1
But you have to have some basic ability.,0
And sadly, she doesn't have that.,0
I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.,1
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,1
And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.,1
Donald doesn't agree with that.,1
All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.,0
But they weren't taken care of.,0
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.,1
And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.,0
I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.,1
She doesn't have the look.,0
She doesn't have the stamina.,0
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,0
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,0
Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.,1
To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.,0
You have -- wait a minute.,0
Wait a minute, Lester.,0
And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.,1
I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,1
You asked me a question.,0
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.,1
Did you ask me a question?,0
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,1
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,1
And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.,1
You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.,0
I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?,0
I think that was a dereliction of duty.,1
And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?,0
I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people. ,1
All you have to do is speak to them.,0
Well...,1
Wait.,0
You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.,0
The world -- let me tell you.,0
Let me tell you.,0
Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.,0
We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.,0
But it's bad, bad experience.,0
Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.,0
The question was about the Supreme Court.,1
And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.,1
But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. ,1
We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,1
I agree.,0
And actually -- well, that was very interesting.,1
She's got experience, but it's bad experience.,0
First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.,1
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,1
I never said that.,0
You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.,1
We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,1
I didn't say that.,0
Where did you find this?,0
But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,1
Where did you find this?,0
So the price of oil has been way down.,1
Where did you find this?,0
And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?,1
Oh, really?,0
OK, good.,0
Let me just tell you...,0
You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.,0
Some of it's said in entertainment.,0
We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.,1
And I think that's an important transition.,1
We've got to remain energy-independent.,1
Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.,0
But you want to know the truth?,0
I was going to say something...,0
... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it.,0
I just can't do it.,0
It's inappropriate.,0
It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,1
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,1
So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.,1
It's not nice.",0
But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.,0
They're untrue.,0
And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.,1
And they're misrepresentations.,0
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,1
That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.,1
A lot of them lost their lives.,1
They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.,1
I don't want to walk away from them.,1
And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.,0
So we've got to do something for them. ,1
And I don't deserve that.,0
But the price of coal is down worldwide.,1
So we have to look at this comprehensively.,1
And that's exactly what I have proposed.,1
I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,1
Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.,1
But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.,0
It's hundreds of millions of ads.,0
Look, I respect his children.,1
And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...,0
His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.,1
... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.,0
I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.,1
And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,1
The other day, we were deporting 800 people.,0
So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.,1
And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.,0
This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.,1
Ended up becoming citizens.,0
We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.,1
And it was 800.,0
And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.,0
Look, here's the story.,0
It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,1
And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.,1
I want to make America great again.,0
And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.,1
I'm going to be able to do it.,0
I don't believe Hillary will.,0
And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day. ,1
The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.,0
Well, I actually agree with that.,0
I agree with everything she said.,0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,0
This is a great country.,0
Thank you very much, Chris.,1
This is a great land.,0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,0
And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,1
I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. ,0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.,0
You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?,1
What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,1
When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.,0
What kind of rights will Americans have?,1
When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.,0
And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.,1
Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.,0
In other words, trading with other countries.,0
We had an $800 billion deficit.,0
For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.,1
It's hard to believe.,0
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,1
Inconceivable.,0
But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.,1
You say who's making these deals?,0
That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.,1
And I look forward to having that opportunity.,1
I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,1
That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,1
We're going the make great deals.,0
We're going to have a strong border.,0
We're going to bring back law and order.,0
The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process. ,1
Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.,0
And this is happening on a weekly basis.,0
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.,0
At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.,0
Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.,1
We need justice.,0
But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.,0
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,1
I represented upstate New York.,1
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,1
It's called make America great again. ,0
No, I didn't say that at all.,0
I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,0
I'm not proud of it.,0
It goes back to the founding of our country.,1
I apologize to my family.,0
I apologize to the American people.,0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,1
Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.,1
And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.,1
But this is locker room talk.,0
I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.,1
You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.,0
We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.,0
And they look and they see.,0
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,1
Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?,0
And they look at our country and they see what's going on.,0
Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.,0
You mentioned the Heller decision.,1
I hate it.,0
But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.,0
I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,0
We're going to defeat ISIS.,0
And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.,1
ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.,0
And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. ,0
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,0
I have great respect for women.,0
And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.,1
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment. ,1
Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.,1
I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.,0
But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.,1
And I was embarrassed by it.,0
But I have tremendous respect for women. ,0
That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.,1
And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.,1
The gun lobby's on his side.,1
And women have respect for me.,0
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,1
And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.,1
But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year. ,1
And I will tell you: No, I have not.,0
Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.,1
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,0
We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.,0
And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.,1
It is about what's happening right now in America.,1
So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.,1
People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.,0
We're going to make America safe again.,0
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.,0
And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. ,0
Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth. ,0
And that's what I want to talk about.,0
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,1
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,1
Am I allowed to respond to that?,0
I assume I am.,0
It's just words, folks.,0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.,1
It's just words.,0
Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.,0
I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions. ,1
I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.,0
I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.,0
And we have come too far to have that turned back now.,1
I'm going to help the African-Americans.,0
And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.,1
And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking. ,1
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,1
I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.,0
I am going to help the inner cities.,0
And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.,1
The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.,1
I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.,1
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,1
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account. ,1
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,0
She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.,0
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,0
Well, that is not what happens in these cases.,1
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,1
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... ,0
You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.,1
So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond? ,0
Sounds fair.,0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,1
It was locker room talk, as I told you.,0
That was locker room talk.,0
And I do not believe the government should be making it.,1
You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.,1
I'm not proud of it.,0
I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.,1
I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.,0
And certainly, I'm not proud of it.,0
And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.,1
And I will stand up for that right. ,1
Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.,1
But that was something that happened.,0
They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.,1
And you're right.,1
I don't want to rip families apart.,1
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,1
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,1
We have 11 million undocumented people.,1
They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.,1
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.,0
Mine are words, and his was action.,0
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,1
His was what he's done to women.,0
Now, here's what that means.,1
It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.,1
And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.,1
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,0
So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.,0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,1
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,1
I have been for border security for years.,1
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,0
Four of them here tonight.,0
One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.,0
Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.,0
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,1
Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.,0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,1
So don't tell me about words.,0
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,1
Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.,1
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,0
But it is things that people say.,0
But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.,0
He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.,0
Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.,0
When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.,1
Didn't even raise it.,1
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,1
And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.,0
Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.,0
So you really owe him an apology.,0
You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.,0
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,1
That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.,0
Number two, Michelle Obama.,0
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship. ,1
I voted for border security, and there are... ,1
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,0
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,1
And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.,0
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,1
But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.,1
Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.,1
So, you talk about friend?,0
Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.,0
And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.,0
And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,0
But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.,0
And I'll tell you what.,0
I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.,0
But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.,0
There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.,0
When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.,0
In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.,0
There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.,0
And Donald knows a lot about this.,1
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,1
So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?,0
He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported.",1
People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,0
I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers. ,1
We will not have open borders.,1
That is...,1
And it's a disgrace.,0
And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. ,0
That is a rank mischaracterization.,1
Oh, really? ,0
We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.,1
Because you'd be in jail.,0
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.,0
Right?,0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,1
Ronald Reagan was the last president... ,1
... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well. ,1
Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.,1
She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,0
You know, it's amazing.,0
I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,0
And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.,0
You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?,0
I don't think so.,0
You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.,1
She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.,0
Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.,0
And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.,1
33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.,0
And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.,0
That wasn't before.,0
I think that would be a great benefit to us.,1
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.,1
That was after.,0
And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.,1
She got it from the United States Congress.,0
And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.,0
Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.,0
But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.,0
What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. ,0
They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.,1
You did that.,0
Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.,1
Wait a minute.,0
One second.,0
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. ,1
So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?,1
If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. ,0
Oh, you didn't delete them? ,0
Oh, 33,000?,0
Those are the questions we need answered.,1
Yeah. ,0
Oh, yeah.,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before. ,1
Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States. ,1
What about the other 15,000? ,0
And it's pretty clear...,1
Because you have nothing to say.,0
It's pretty clear you won't admit...,1
... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.,1
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,1
Get off this question.,0
Let's see what happensÉ,0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,1
I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?,0
We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.,1
I find that deeply disturbing. ,1
And I think it's time you take a stand...,1
I am not quoting myself.,1
I am quoting 17...,1
I'd like to know.,0
... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,1
... agencies.,1
Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.,1
Why aren't you bringing... ,0
I find that just absolutely…,1
No, it hasn't.,0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,1
This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.,1
It hasn't.,0
And it hasn't been finished at all. ,0
He's... ,1
... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.,1
But here's the deal.,1
It's nice to -- one on three.,0
No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.,0
The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.,1
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,1
Go ahead.,0
It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.,0
And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button. ,1
Obamacare is a disaster.,0
Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked... ,1
... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.,1
That kind... ,1
You know it.,0
... of language -- well...,1
The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.,1
Donald wants to tear up our alliances.,1
I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.,1
I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.,1
That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace. ,1
We all know it.,0
Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.,1
I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.,1
I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.,1
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,0
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,0
It's only getting worse.,0
New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.,1
In '17, it implodes by itself.,0
I want us to do more to help small business.,1
That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,1
Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.,0
I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.,1
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,0
Obamacare will never work.,0
It's very bad, very bad health insurance.,0
And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,1
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,1
Far too expensive.,0
That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.,1
I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.,1
And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.,0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0
And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.,1
Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,1
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.,0
We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.,0
So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,1
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,1
We want competition.,0
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,1
You will have the finest health care plan there is.,0
By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.,1
Why?,1
Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.,1
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,1
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession. ,1
She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.,0
Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because... ,1
... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.,1
And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.,0
I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.,1
It's catastrophic in certain ways.,0
I also will not add a penny to the debt.,1
But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.,0
I have costed out what I'm going to do.,1
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,0
Obamacare was the first step.,0
He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.,1
Obamacare is a total disaster.,0
Well, he mentioned the debt.,1
And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it. ,0
It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. ,0
We know how to get control of the debt.,1
Well, I just want -- just one thing.,0
First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.,0
Everything.,0
Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.,0
This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. ,0
When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.,1
When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.,1
He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.,1
By the way...,0
So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.,1
So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.,1
That's the kind of approach that will work. ,1
We're going to be able to.,0
You're going to have plans...,0
Well, I'll tell you what it means.,0
Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.,1
It has not worked the way that it has been promised. ,1
Well, it's a combination, Chris.,1
You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.,0
Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... ,0
President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.,0
And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.,1
President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.,0
I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.,1
You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.,0
I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,1
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,1
He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,1
President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.,0
But it was a terrible recession.,1
The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.,0
So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.,1
So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.,1
That is not going to work.,1
That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.,1
We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.,1
We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do. ,1
But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.,0
Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.,1
It didn't meet my test.,1
And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.,0
I've had the same test.,1
We're going to block grant into the states.,0
Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?,1
I'm against it now.,1
We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... ,0
I'll be against it after the election.,1
... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.,0
Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.,0
I'll be against it when I'm president.,1
But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,0
I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.,0
And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,0
There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.,1
He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.,1
But he mentioned China.,1
And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.,1
I have fought against that as a senator.,1
When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.,0
I've stood up against it as secretary of state.,1
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.,1
As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.,0
Horribly wounded.,0
In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.,1
So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers. ,1
That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.,1
We're going to pull the country together.,1
They'll never be the same.,0
We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.,1
Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,0
That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.,1
And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.,0
And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products. ,1
No, I voted. ,1
If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.,0
Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times. ,1
Go outside.,0
Look at Paris.,0
But I think it's really an important issue.,1
Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.,0
He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.,1
You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.,0
He won't use the term "radical Islamic terrorism.",0
And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.,1
He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.,1
Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.,0
In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.,1
He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.,1
In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.,1
He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine. ,1
She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.,0
But the name is there.,0
And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice.",1
So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision. ,1
Well...,1
It's radical Islamic terror.,0
At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.,1
And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.,1
Now, what was his response?,1
Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted. ,1
In fact, he went on to say... ,1
He went on to say, "Look at her.,1
I don't think so.",1
About another woman, he said, "That wouldn't be my first choice.",1
He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her "disgusting," as he has called a number of women during this campaign.,1
And before you solve it, you have to say the name. ,0
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.,1
He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.,1
First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.,0
Iraq was disaster.,0
So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.,1
So he would have been alive today.,0
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0
Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,0
Excuse me.. ,0
That's who Donald is.,1
Why don't you interrupt her?,0
I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.,1
America is great, because America is good.,1
You interrupt me all the time.,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0
And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren. ,1
It's called extreme vetting.,0
Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.,1
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,0
People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.,0
This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,0
And it's not just about women.,1
He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,1
We have enough problems in this country.,0
So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.,1
I believe in building safe zones.,0
But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television. ,1
He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.,1
He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers "people who aren't captured.",1
He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.,1
I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.,0
So it's not one thing.,1
This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.,1
But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.,0
That is not who America is.,1
We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. ,0
That's not been debunked.,0
That has not been debunked.,0
I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.,0
Has not been debunked.,0
And you voted for it.,0
And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.,1
It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have. ,1
And you shouldn't have.,0
Well, I just want to say... ,0
Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.,1
Excuse me.,0
The State Department has said that.,1
She just went about 25 seconds over her time.,0
Could I just respond to this, please? ,0
Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.,0
I think that's been proven.,1
When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.,0
In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.,0
But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.,1
And they don't want them.,0
And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.,0
You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.,1
But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.,1
In partnership with the American Health Association... ,1
... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches... ,1
Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.,0
Well, it is an open discussion.,1
And you... ,1
They're murderers and some very bad people.,0
Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is…,1
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...,1
... and the high rankings…,1
Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.,1
I'm very proud of that.,1
And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.,0
We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.,0
At a record clip.,0
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,1
And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.,1
And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.,0
ICE just endorsed me.,0
I mean, who does that?,1
They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.,0
It just was astonishing.,1
But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.,1
The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.,0
She doesn't.,0
She wants amnesty for everybody.,0
The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.,1
Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.,1
Come right in.,0
The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.,1
We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.,1
And we're going to keep working to help Haiti... ,1
Come right over.,0
It's a horrible thing she's doing.,0
... because it's an important part of the American experience.,1
She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.,0
But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.,1
He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.,1
You can look at our tax returns.,1
That I can tell you. ,0
Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.,0
We've got them all out there.,1
Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.,0
Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.,0
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,1
And she lied.,0
And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.,1
You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.,1
Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.,0
That's one that I haven't... ,0
OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.,0
So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.,1
That's the good thing.,0
That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.,0
I find that just astonishing. ,1
That's a big, big difference.,0
We're talking about some difference.,0
Well, you know... ,1
Made with Chinese steel.,1
But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.,0
Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.,1
I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.,0
You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.,1
But I don't know Putin.,0
But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.,0
The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.,1
Maybe there is no hacking.,0
They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.,1
He lost the Iowa caucus.,1
But they always blame Russia.,0
He lost the Wisconsin primary.,1
And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.,0
He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.,1
I know nothing about Russia.,0
I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.,0
Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,1
I don't deal there.,0
I have no businesses there.,0
There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him. ,1
This is -- this is a mindset.,1
This is how Donald thinks.,1
I have no loans from Russia.,0
And it's funny, but it's also really troubling. ,1
I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.,0
One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.,0
But I have no loans with Russia.,0
You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.,0
So that is not the way our democracy works.,1
We've been around for 240 years.,1
We've had free and fair elections.,1
Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.,0
As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,0
We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.,1
And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.,1
Many of her friends took bigger deductions.,0
You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...,1
... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.,1
And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.,1
Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.,0
He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,1
And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position. ,1
Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.,1
But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.,1
I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.,1
In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.,1
Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.,0
Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.,0
The goal here is to take back Mosul.,1
It's going to be a hard fight.,1
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,0
But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.,0
I've got no illusions about that.,1
I'll be very proud to.,0
And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.,1
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,1
They're actually quite great. ,0
Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.,0
But we know we've got lots of work to do.,1
One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.,0
Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.,1
So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.,1
That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.,1
And she could have done this years ago, by the way.,0
If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.,1
She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.,0
And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track. ,1
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.,0
Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.,1
Well, why didn't she change it?,0
I said it was a mistake.,1
Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,0
I've said that years ago.,1
The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,0
And I do.,0
You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.,0
He has consistently denied what is... ,1
But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.,0
... a very clear fact that...,1
But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,0
You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.,0
... before the invasion, he supported it.,1
"I wish you would have done this.",0
And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.,1
But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.,0
Google "Donald Trump Iraq.",1
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq. ,1
She never changed.,0
And she never will change.,0
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.,1
She never will change.,0
Now, why does that matter?,1
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,0
Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.,1
I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.,0
We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.,0
I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,1
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
We're cutting taxes for the middle class.,0
But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,1
Mosul is a Sunni city.,1
And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.,0
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.,0
Mosul is on the border of Syria.,1
And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice," and we brought him to justice.,1
We need to go after the leadership.,1
But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.,1
You can look at me.,0
She's raising your taxes really high.,0
And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.,0
There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,1
They've been digging underground.,1
They've been prepared to defend.,1
But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.,0
It's going to be tough fighting.,1
But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.,1
That in itself is a big difference.,0
We are going to be thriving again.,0
We have no growth in this country.,0
This is what we have to do.,1
There's no growth.,0
I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.,1
If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.,0
We're down at 1 percent.,0
And that's, like, no growth.,0
You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy. ,1
He has all the conspiracy theories…,1
This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time. ,1
And we're going lower, in my opinion.,0
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.,0
And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,0
And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,0
He says…,1
But she is raising everybody's taxes massively. ,0
Of course I do.,0
Of course I do.,0
And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.,0
... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks. ,1
I know many of her donors.,0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs. ,0
Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.,1
A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.,0
And he has said... ,1
... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.,1
And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.,0
I think he's right. ,1
That's why.,0
Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.,1
I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,1
This would not be done just on the first day.,1
This would take a lot of negotiation.,1
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.,0
Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.,0
And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.,1
We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,1
So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.,1
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,1
He's made these claims repeatedly.,1
But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.,0
I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.,1
But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,1
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,0
That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.,1
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.,0
I absolutely used it.,0
And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.,1
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,0
Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.,0
That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.,1
In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.,1
So we won't make them famous. ,0
No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.,0
So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.,1
And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home. ,1
Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.,1
And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.,1
But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.,0
You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.,1
He was criticizing President Reagan.,1
This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.,1
But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.,1
I love depreciation.,0
I do not add a penny to the national debt.,1
I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.,1
You know, she's given it to us.,0
So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.,1
Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.,0
I say it all the time.,0
We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.,1
She talks about health care.,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.,1
In fact, I think just the opposite.,1
She talks about taxes.,0
We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.,1
We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.,1
Why didn't she do something about it?,0
That's where growth will come from.,1
That's why I want to invest in you.,1
I want to invest in your family.,1
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,0
And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.,1
With her, it's all talk and no action. ,0
And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.,0
And we just have a big disagreement about this.,1
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0
It may be because of our experiences.,1
You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire... ,1
She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.,0
I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.,1
I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.,0
They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.,0
Congratulations.,0
Great job. ,0
Why didn't you do it?,0
Why didn't you do it?,0
And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy. ,1
Oh, really? ,0
Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.,1
You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.,0
If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.,0
That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.,1
My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.,1
But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund... ,1
... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.,1
I will not cut benefits.,1
But you were not an effective senator. ,0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0
I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.,1
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.,1
I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe... ,0
That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.,1
Excuse me.,0
And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.,1
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0
The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.,1
A disaster.,0
So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.,1
What we need to do is go after... ,1
... the long-term health care drivers.,1
We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.,1
First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which... ,0
OK.,0
I have a plan for doing that.,1
And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions. ,1
But you were in contact -- excuse me.,0
You were...,0
You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.,0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0
Obama draws the line in the sand.,0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,0
Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.,0
But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.,0
Not good.,0
Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.,1
We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.,1
You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.,1
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,0
And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.,1
I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.,1
That's what my mission will be in the presidency.,1
I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.,1
I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.,1
We are old.,0
I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president. ,1
I want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders.,1
Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows.,1
We're tired.,0
It really was like seeing the future of America in one room.,1
I can't wait to see everything that they achieve.,1
And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work! ,1
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,0
A very bad thing.,0
And I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.,1
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.,0
She talks in favor of the rebels.,0
You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community ... when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington.,1
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,0
You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.,0
And you know what happens?,0
They end up being worse than the people.,0
And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now ... not just for Latinos but for our country.,1
My friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters.,1
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,0
You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters.,1
By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.,1
Now, here's a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn't be, right?,1
But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama.,1
He's always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.,1
Gadhafi's out.,0
I, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression.,1
Think of what we've achieved these last eight years.,1
American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession.,1
Twenty million Americans have health coverage ... and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans.,1
We got more good news this week.,1
A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.,1
It's a mess.,0
Now, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch.,1
And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.,0
Our work is far from finished.,1
But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us.,1
I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise.,1
I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0
That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are.,1
And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged.,1
It was a disaster.,0
But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.,1
Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.,0
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.,0
We sign a peace treaty.,0
Everyone's all excited.,0
Either we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.,1
Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.,0
But look at that deal.,0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.,0
Either we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.,1
Either we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.,1
Today, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month.,1
So she wants to fight.,0
She wants to fight for rebels.,0
There's only one problem.,0
In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Juli..n and Joaqu..n Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others ... names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.,1
You don't even know who the rebels are.,0
So what's the purpose? ,0
Whether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you're not strangers.,1
And one thing I have to say.,0
You're not intruders.,1
I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.,0
Russia is killing ISIS.,0
You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families.,1
You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative.,1
And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again ... time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.,1
And Iran is killing ISIS.,0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy. ,0
As I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election.,1
OK.,0
And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families.,1
He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.,0
That's been the cause of my life.,1
It will be the passion of my presidency.,1
I disagree. ,0
So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.,1
First, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth.,1
We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids.,1
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0
So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy. ,1
Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.,0
And we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere.,1
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0
Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.,0
I believe we have to get ISIS.,0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,0
She had a chance to do something with Syria.,0
And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners.,1
Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America.,1
And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today.,1
Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity.,1
When families are strong, America is strong.,1
And that brings me to another important family issue.,1
They had a chance.,0
In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress.,1
My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship.,1
Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it.,1
And that was the line.,0
And she didn't. ,0
In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade.,1
I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise. ,0
I think that it basically has fallen.,0
OK?,0
But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on.,1
I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter. ,1
And in this election ... in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand.,1
And you know how we'll show that?,1
It basically has fallen.,0
Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January.,1
Let me tell you something.,0
[Cheers.],1
You take a look at Mosul.,0
The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.,0
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,0
So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.,0
Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.,0
But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump. ,1
Why can't they do it quietly?,0
Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?,0
And while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together.,1
People leave.,0
When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families.,1
Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?,0
How stupid is our country? ,0
I can't think of any.,0
I can't think of any.,0
And I'm pretty good at it.,0
And we have General Flynn.,0
But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case.,1
And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.,0
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0
And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.,1
But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do.,1
We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too.,1
We talk about it all the time.,0
Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses.,1
And we won't stop there.,1
They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?,0
How -- why would these people stay there?,0
We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups.,1
I've been reading now... ,0
... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.,0
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,0
They're gone.,0
Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.,0
Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.,0
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.,1
So here's the bottom line.,1
Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been ... a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.,1
Now, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others.,1
All I say is this.,0
They helped change the conversation.,1
And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.,1
Right now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future.,1
General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East. ,0
They're DREAMers in much more than name.,1
Everything.,0
You know what's funny?,0
She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.,0
When I go one second over, it's like a big deal. ,0
I've met so many.,1
It's really -- it's really very interesting.,0
Absolutely.,0
I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.,0
I will be a president for all of our people.,0
And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.,0
I've listened to their stories.,1
They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.,1
Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.,0
Not in this country.,0
It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.,0
So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.,1
We lost our jobs.,0
I picture Astrid Silva ... who I met in Las Vegas.,1
Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing.,1
We lost our money.,0
Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.,1
I picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story.,1
We lost our plants.,0
His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic.,1
It is a disaster.,0
He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army.,1
Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.,1
And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.,0
She called it the gold standard.,0
And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.,0
They actually said that she lied.,0
OK?,0
He was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.',1
He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child.,1
He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship.,1
And she lied.,0
But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device.,1
But she's lied about a lot of things. ,0
He was just 19.,1
The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.,1
All these years later ... his teacher still treasures his memory.,1
I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.,0
Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,0
And this teacher wanted me to know ... he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.,1
She's been talking about it for years.,0
As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.,0
The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.,1
She doesn't get it done.,0
We teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.,1
Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all.,1
Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.,0
Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent ... from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.,1
And every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower.,1
His latest target?,1
A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks.,1
The same exact thing.,0
He called her a nervous mess.,1
How insulting, how dead wrong.,1
Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess ... she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America.,1
And again today, he did it again.,1
They talk, they don't get it done.,0
He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?',1
And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.',1
You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.,0
African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.,0
He still wouldn't say 'America.',1
The education is a disaster.,0
Jobs are essentially nonexistent.,0
This man wants to be our next president?,1
When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?,1
Now, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times.,1
I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?,0
This is the best he can do.,1
This is who he is.,1
And so we need to decide who we are.,1
It can't get any worse.,0
And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.,0
If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are?,1
We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric.,1
Nothing's going to ever happen.,0
Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.,0
It's just going to be talk.,0
We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear.,1
And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.,0
We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren,1
She's not doing any me favors.,0
Parents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.',1
Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.,1
At a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.',1
Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes.,1
But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors. ,0
But I will tell you, she's all talk.,0
His message is you should be afraid ... afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country.,1
It doesn't get done.,0
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,0
Take a look at upstate New York. ,0
It turned out to be a disaster.,0
... but we believed that we could make the country better.,0
And I was proud of that.,0
There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore.,1
It's all right out there in the open now.,1
We have a divided nation.,0
We have a very divided nation.,0
So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.,1
You look at Charlotte.,0
Just this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco.,1
He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican.,1
As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage.,1
And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me.,1
He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off.,1
You look at Baltimore.,0
You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.,0
We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.,0
And when she said deplorables, she meant it.,0
And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. ,0
When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in.,1
And I believe Trump is wrong.',1
And good for you, Francisco.,1
That's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.,1
She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.,0
And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her. ,0
No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.,0
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. ,0
Together, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.,1
By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.,0
She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,0
We've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you.,1
Guess what?,0
She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens... ,0
... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.,0
Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.,1
So we're going to keep asking for your help.,1
Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.,0
Keep hitting the campaign trail.,1
But she said she'll be awake.,0
Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community ... everyone you see between now and November 8th.,1
Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.,0
Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved.,1
This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.,1
So let's stand up for a future where we put families first.,1
Guess what happened?,0
Where we build bridges, not walls.,1
And yes, together we can prove love trumps hate.,1
Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.,0
Thank you all very much.",1
Now, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is ... is Ruline still here?,1
I know she was going to try to stay.,1
And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.,0
There she is.,1
So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.,0
Hello, Ruline!,1
Hello, Ruline!,1
Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913.,1
Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.,0
I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline.,1
I mean, you can like it or not like it.,0
But I really do recommend that you see them both.,1
Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world.,1
And I think it's important to have that perspective.,1
So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me.,1
I am so pleased.,1
And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts. ,1
I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.,0
It's a very effective way of communication.,0
I want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats.,1
And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge.,1
So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.,0
I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. ,0
I'm shocked to hear that.,0
Where's Patty?,1
Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate.,1
And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate.,1
We have the slowest growth since 1929.,0
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.,0
Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.,0
And we have a vacancy.,0
I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,0
Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington.,1
But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.,1
I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.,0
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,0
And I think that this is so important.,0
Now, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding.,1
Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.,0
I talked with the mayor.,1
They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.,0
So important to me.,0
I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so.,1
Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.,0
So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.,0
What I ask is this.,0
So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.,0
Pretty much self-funding money.,0
We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.,0
They hope that they will not have the flooding.,1
I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.,0
They took a lot of good precautionary measures.,1
She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,0
Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?,0
It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.,0
Why aren't you putting some money in?,0
You have a lot of it.,0
You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,0
Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding.,1
Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.,0
And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids. ,1
Now, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey.,1
That's very personal to me.,1
I live in New York.,1
People commute into New York from New Jersey.,1
We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died.,1
I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage.,1
So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.,1
Now, we are starting to vote in Iowa today!,1
So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,0
And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today.,1
I'm just curious. ,0
And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left.,1
And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path.,1
We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country.,1
Absolutely.,0
And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.,1
Now, how many of you participated in the caucuses?,1
I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.,0
Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here.,1
Under absolutely siege.,0
Are you ready to go to the polls?,1
The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.,0
And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,0
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,0
Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.,0
Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today.,1
But we need much more than wind and solar.,0
Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country.,1
And you look at our miners.,0
Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,0
And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites.,1
We've got one right down the street.,1
There is a thing called clean coal.,0
Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.,0
So when you finish here, you can go vote.,1
And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.,1
Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,0
We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.,0
So good.,0
Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,0
I will bring our energy companies back.,0
Any of you see that debate on Monday night?,1
They'll be able to compete.,0
Well, one down, two to go.,1
They'll make money.,0
They'll pay off our national debt.,0
They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.,0
Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody.,1
And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life.,1
But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,0
We have to bring back our workers.,0
It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America.,1
You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.,0
We have to guard our energy companies.,0
And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.,1
We have to make it possible.,0
Now, you may have heard me say this.,1
I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa.,1
But I was very fortunate.,1
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,0
And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.,0
It's a disgrace. ,0
None of us picks our parents.,1
It's an absolute disgrace.,0
But I really was fortunate.,1
My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life.,1
And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies.,1
Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.,0
And it was not a very big building.,1
I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.,0
And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.,0
It didn't have any natural life.,1
There were no windows in it.,1
So I consider that a compliment.,0
I will say this about Hillary.,0
It's what he could afford.,1
She doesn't quit.,0
She doesn't give up.,0
And there were two long tables.,1
I respect that.,0
I tell it like it is.,0
She's a fighter.,0
I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,0
And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen.,1
Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen?,1
Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store.,1
Right?,1
I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,0
And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing.,1
So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in.,1
But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.,0
And I consider that to be a very good trait. ,0
Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it.,1
Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.,0
And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table.,1
The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,0
Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.,0
And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again.,1
Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.,0
And she was forced to apologize.,0
And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.,1
That's how I was raised to think about doing business.,1
You do your best.,1
And apologize she did.,0
But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.,0
We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.,0
I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.,0
But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.,0
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,0
They will have a conservative bent.,0
You enter into a contract or an agreement.,1
Somebody orders your goods or your services.,1
And then they pay you for it.,1
Right?,1
And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy.,1
They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,0
They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.,0
Her words.,1
And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for.,1
I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.,1
All that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents?,1
They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,0
And I believe that's very, very important.,0
I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,0
It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.,0
That's just wrong.,1
What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people?,1
And those are the people that I will appoint. ,0
We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated.,1
I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America.,1
And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country. ,1
Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.,0
I watched.,0
Now, my mom had a very different story.,1
My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family.,1
My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her.,1
So she was out on her own by the age of 14.,1
I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.,0
And Justice Scalia was so involved.,0
She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter.,1
And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other.,1
So for her, it was a gift.,1
And then she got another gift.,1
The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school.,1
And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school.,1
But you'll have to come right back.',1
And it was a well-crafted decision.,0
That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference.,1
But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.,0
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say. ,0
Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.,0
And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run ... run ... to get there.,1
In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.,0
But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.,1
So when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way.,1
So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.,0
That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.,1
So that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families?,1
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,0
And so when I talk about the economy ... because I think we have three big issues facing us.,1
And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.,0
Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right?,1
We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values.,1
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,0
So I'm very honored by all of that.,0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0
We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment. ,0
And we need to bring our country together.,1
We have to heal these divides.,1
But when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes.,1
Right.,0
I see my friends from the laborers here.,1
Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states. ,0
If they overturned it, it will go back to the states. ,0
We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems.,1
This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America.,1
Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.,0
And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.,0
I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination. ,0
We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents ... and sometimes even great-grandparents ... made.,1
If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again.,1
Well, I think it's terrible.,0
If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.,0
Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.,0
But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.,0
And that's not acceptable. ,0
And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing.,1
And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.,0
And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa.,1
I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country.,1
And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing.,1
Nobody has that. ,0
Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.,0
We need strong borders.,0
I was so impressed.,1
And I think we need to do that across America.,1
And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools.,1
In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.,0
It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.,1
Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy.,1
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0
Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa.,1
They're coming in illegally.,0
It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack.,1
But it's been continued over the years.,1
Drugs are pouring in through the border.,0
We have no country if we have no border.,0
And look at the results.,1
Hillary wants to give amnesty.,0
Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind.,1
Right?,1
And look at the number of jobs ... it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that.,1
She wants to have open borders.,0
Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material.,1
I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.,1
I'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1
I know it's real.,1
The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.,0
I believe in science.,1
But I'll tell you what else is real.,1
What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that.,1
Now, we also need to help small businesses.,1
Iowa is filled with small businesses.,1
It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations.,1
We're going to try to streamline that process.,1
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,0
Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands.,1
It means their job is tougher.,0
And we're going to work hard.,1
I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses. ,1
But they know what's going on.,0
They know it better than anybody.,0
But while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer.,1
And here are a couple of things I want to do.,1
Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty.,1
I've met ... you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women ... and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America.,1
Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work.,1
We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.,1
They want strong borders.,0
They feel we have to have strong borders.,0
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0
And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits.,1
The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.,0
You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row.,1
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,0
And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent.,1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,0
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0
But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees.,1
We have to have strong borders.,0
300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.,1
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0
We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.,0
And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics.,1
We need strong borders.,0
You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare.,1
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0
Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent.,1
Incomes barely budged, right?,1
So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare.,1
Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities.,1
Now, I want to build the wall.,0
A lot of families are just so stressed out.,1
The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members.,1
We need the wall.,0
And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.,0
Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it.,1
We stop the drugs.,0
Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work.,1
Right?,1
That's a lot of you.,1
There you are.,1
We shore up the border.,0
Okay.,1
And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over.,1
One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.,0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0
And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.,0
But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out. ,0
When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry?,1
Chris, I think it's... ,0
I think I should respond to that.,0
She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work.,1
First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.,0
Right back to work.,1
Very nice man.,0
But it's not just for babies.,1
It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems.,1
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,0
Believe me.,0
The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.,0
There is nothing more important than caring for each other.,1
It's a disaster.,0
And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.,1
The other big expense for family economics is education.,1
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,0
Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right?,1
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,0
Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.,0
And we also have to make college affordable.,1
Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders.,1
I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran.,1
It was a campaign about issues, not insults.,1
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. ,0
And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there.,1
And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together.,1
And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less.,1
We are a country of laws.,0
And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.,1
Now, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans.,1
We either have -- and by the way...,0
An education should give you a boost, not hold you back.,1
And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt.,1
Well -- well, but she said one thing. ,0
And the wall.,0
We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa.,1
President Obama has moved millions of people out.,0
We're going to help you refinance.,1
It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans.,1
Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.,0
I'll tell you what.,1
I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.,1
But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.,0
And college is crucial, but this is not said often enough.,1
Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life.,1
So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.',1
They've been deported.,0
She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.,0
We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.,1
As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.,0
We're a country of laws.,0
So I'm excited about what we can do together.,1
We either have a border or we don't.,0
Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.,0
I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates.,1
But it's very unfair.,0
We have millions of people that did it the right way.,0
They're on line.,0
And the list is long.,1
But it's not about that.,1
They're waiting.,0
We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.,0
But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.,0
Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.,0
You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders. ,0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,0
Thank you.,0
That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?,0
How did we get on to Putin? ,0
It's about you.,1
So just to finish on the borders...,0
It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job.,1
Now, I have this old-fashioned idea.,1
I'm asking for your vote.,1
She wants open borders.,0
People are going to pour into our country.,0
People are going to come in from Syria.,0
I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are.,1
She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.,0
They have no idea where they come from.,0
And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.,0
So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book.,1
And I see somebody holding one in the front row.,1
It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.',1
She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.,0
So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.,0
Now we can talk about Putin.,0
I don't know Putin.,0
He said nice things about me.,0
You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks.,1
If we got along well, that would be good.,0
And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it.,1
And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.,1
If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.,0
Now, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America.,1
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all.,1
And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America.,1
Calling us a third world country.,1
He has no respect for her.,0
Saying our military is a disaster.,1
He has no respect for our president.,0
That everything about America is in bad shape.,1
And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.,0
And she's playing chicken.,0
But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems.,1
He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes.,1
He says that makes him smart.,1
Well, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us?,1
Look, Putin... ,0
... from everything I see, has no respect for this person. ,0
No puppet.,0
My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public.,1
No puppet.,0
You're the puppet!,0
No, you're the puppet. ,0
You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that.,1
But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.,1
She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else. ,0
She has no idea.,0
Hillary, you have no idea. ,0
And our country has no idea.,0
Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9.,1
Think about that.,1
Yeah, I doubt it.,0
Five million families lost their homes.,1
I doubt it. ,0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,0
Excuse me.,0
And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it.,1
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,0
He even said that it is just business.,1
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,0
Yes, that's fine. ,0
Well, what kind of person believes that ... that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business?,1
By Russia or anybody else.,0
Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.,1
So look, I think after ...,1
Of course I condemn.,0
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,0
I have no idea.,0
I never met Putin.,0
This is not my best friend.,0
Thank you.,1
I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare.,1
But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.,0
Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.,0
I have no idea what he's going to say the next time.,1
Whether it's Syria, you name it.,0
But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.,1
Missiles.,0
But we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help.,1
The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot.,1
It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country.,1
We can have our differences, for heaven sakes.,1
Take a look at the "start up" that they signed.,0
We're Americans; that's in our DNA.,1
The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.,0
But we should respect one another.,1
We should listen to one another.,1
That's the way we're going to get things done together.,1
And so I want you to join this campaign.,1
They create warheads, and we can't.,0
The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th.,1
The Russians can't believe it.,0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.,0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,0
They've taken over.,0
So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
We've spent $6 trillion.,0
If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?',1
Iwillvote.com.,1
You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered.,1
Because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that they're not on it.,1
So check that out.,1
They've taken over the Middle East.,0
And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote.,1
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever. ,0
And she always will be.,0
Wrong.,0
I have 200 generals...,0
... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.,0
As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.,0
We are spending a fortune doing it.,0
And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having.,1
They have the bargain of the century.,0
Because we will prove that we are stronger together.,1
And you know what else we'll prove?,1
All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.,0
We will prove that love trumps hate.,1
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons. ,0
Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.,0
This is just another lie. ,0
There's no quote.,0
You're not going to find a quote from me.,0
Thank you all very much.",1
And I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me.,1
He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm.,1
And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise.,1
And defend yourselves.,0
And defend yourselves.,0
We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.,1
I didn't say nuclear.,0
Well, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson.,1
And defend yourself.,0
And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together.,1
And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy.,1
I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you?,1
Yes.,0
And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America ... Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.,1
Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.,0
And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember ...,1
I'm so pleased he's here with us ...,1
Her tax plan is a disaster.,0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0
Congressman Alcee Hastings.,1
And I'm a big proponent.,0
And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district ... is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.,1
Before I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez.,1
When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English.,1
He didn't let that stop him.,1
He pursued his dreams.,1
He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen.,1
And he never forgot where he came from.,1
He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him.,1
Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started.,1
I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.,1
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0
I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson.,1
My heart goes out to Bob's family.,1
He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.,1
But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,0
Now, did any of you see the debate the other night?,1
We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan. ,0
Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have.,1
But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.,0
Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.,0
We protect Saudi Arabia.,0
Why aren't they paying?,0
She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.,0
Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,0
My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.,1
I believe America is an exceptional nation.,1
Because they weren't paying.,0
Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.,0
My opponent believes America is in decline.,1
I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States.,1
And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,0
All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.,0
They have to pay up.,0
We're protecting people, they have to pay up.,0
And I'm a big fan of NATO.,0
When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about.,1
And why are we already great?,1
Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military.,1
But they have to pay up.,0
It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country.,1
I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.,1
This morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities.,1
She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.,0
Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.,0
Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good.,1
And we can't ever forget that.,1
We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.,0
I have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater.,1
I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate.,1
I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do.,1
I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. ,1
That means new jobs ... new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.,1
We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.,0
My opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall.,1
We're up to $20 trillion.,0
I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked.,1
So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.,0
We're going to have a lot of free trade.,0
We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.,0
He didn't even raise it.,1
He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.',1
But we have horrible deals.,0
So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up.,1
He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall.,1
I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe?,1
Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.,0
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,0
You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.,0
You go upstate New York.,0
Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.,0
I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could.,1
We're bringing our jobs back.,0
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0
And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.,0
Really, why does he do things like that?,1
I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him.,1
It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.,0
I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.,1
So I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election.,1
Getting those new jobs.,1
And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business.,1
And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.,0
As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman.,1
We are going to cut taxes massively.,0
We're going to cut business taxes massively.,0
They're going to start hiring people.,0
He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life.,1
We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion... ,0
... that's offshore back into the country.,0
I'm really proud of that.,1
We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... ,0
... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP. ,0
You can't.,0
And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad.,1
Correct.,0
Over a 10-year period.,0
So I just left some high representatives of India.,0
But we need to do more to get small business started and growing ... here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.,1
So as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer.,1
They're growing at 8 percent.,0
I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few.,1
So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty.,1
And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids.,1
China is growing at 7 percent.,0
And that for them is a catastrophically low number.,0
We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.,0
And I think it's going down.,0
And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000.,1
Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.,0
A terrible jobs report.,0
In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?,0
Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.,0
The report was so bad.,0
I think we can do better.,1
And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. ,1
Look, our country is stagnant.,0
We've lost our jobs.,0
Something else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work.,1
We've lost our businesses.,0
We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.,0
Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.,0
I've visited so many communities.,0
This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.,0
Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue.,1
If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly.,1
I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.,0
That will raise family incomes.,1
And they cry when they see what's happened.,0
And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure ... to make sure ... more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place.,1
The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban.,1
He was sitting in the front row.,1
And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing.,1
He's always, in his companies, shared profits.,1
I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.,0
Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.,0
And by the way, he is a real billionaire.,1
And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires.,1
I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.,1
Boy, did they suffer.,0
That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.,0
Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
And she wants it.,0
And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing.,1
She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.,0
She totally lied.,0
It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it?,1
I think we can do better.,1
She did call it the gold standard.,0
I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college. ,1
Now, after the primary was over ... and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what?,1
I was really proud.,1
We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.,1
And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.,0
He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education?,1
Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford.,1
And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.,1
I was so honored. ,0
So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan.,1
And it's pretty simple.,1
You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly.,1
If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university.,1
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.,0
Well, let me just say -- let me just say. ,0
Let me ask a simple question.,0
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0
And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go.,1
And we put together a calculator on my website.,1
You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.,1
But I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt.,1
Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years? ,0
So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time. ,1
You were very much involved -- excuse me.,0
But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree.,1
I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain ...,1
I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job.,1
My turn.,0
You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.,0
Very much.,0
And you do have experience.,0
I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.,0
I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school.,1
We need to put technical education back into high school.,1
For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.,0
And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job.,1
I wouldn't mind.,0
And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs ... not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.',1
The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.,0
You don't.,0
Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.,0
How do you miss $6 billion?,0
Now, I'm excited about this.,1
I really am.,1
I am confident and optimistic about our country.,1
You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.,0
We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else.,1
That's not who we are as Americans.,1
We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.,1
And while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world.,1
They don't know.,0
It's gone, $6 billion.,0
If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.,0
Believe me. ,0
Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries.,1
Give me a break.,0
He has this weird fascination with dictators.,1
He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list.,1
He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons.,1
Well, I think I did a much better job.,0
I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.,0
I started with a $1 million loan.,0
He said he doesn't care.,1
I agree with that.,0
It's a $1 million loan.,0
But I built a phenomenal company.,0
And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.,0
You would even be proud of it.,0
And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.,0
Take a look at the migration.,0
Take a look at Libya.,0
Take a look at Iraq.,0
She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.,0
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,0
Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon.,1
And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.,0
And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.,0
She's going to get rid of nobody. ,0
Whoa!,1
Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.,0
Those people -- I don't know those people.,0
I have a feeling how they came.,0
That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.,1
As I told him in the debate ... he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.',1
Words matter.,1
And America's word matters.,1
I believe it was her campaign that did it.,0
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,0
She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.,0
We have to be reliable and trustworthy.,1
They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.,0
People have to count on us.,1
And we've got a lot of work to do around the world.,1
We need to work hard for peace and prosperity.,1
We need to tackle climate change together. ,1
I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.,0
Climate change is real.,1
And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.,0
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,0
These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.,0
And I think it's her campaign.,0
Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.,0
And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.,0
Florida knows that.,1
My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
And that was now all on tape, started by her.,0
I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.,0
If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.,0
But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.,0
It was lies, and it was fiction. ,0
And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents.,1
You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century.,1
I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us.,1
I did not say that.,0
I did not say that.,0
I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen.,1
Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,1
Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it.,1
I did not say that.,0
There's so much we can do together.,1
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0
Nobody.,0
Nobody has more respect...,0
And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.,0
And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.,0
She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.,0
But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,0
What happened to the FBI, I don't know.,0
We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.,0
And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.,1
One lie.,0
And then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together.,1
She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.,0
He's going to probably go to jail.,0
I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine.,1
That's who we are.,1
This is a four-star general.,0
I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other.,1
And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?,0
And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents.,1
That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign. ,0
I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband.,1
But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first.,1
They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other.,1
Wrong.,0
So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.,0
And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...",1
<i>Audience Member:</i> "Day one.",1
It's on tape. ,0
The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things... ,0
... but those other charges, as she knows, are false. ,0
<i>Clinton:</i> "...is to make them day one ... you're right ... is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.,1
Now ... so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November.,1
The stakes could not be higher.,1
I think that it's been very well...,0
It's been very well studied.,0
... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it. ,0
It's a criminal enterprise.,0
So here is what I am asking all of you.,1
Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.,0
You talk about women and women's rights?,0
How many of you know you are registered to vote?,1
So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th.,1
If you've moved, you may need to reregister.,1
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,0
Here's how you can find out if you are registered.,1
You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com.,1
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,0
And yet you take their money.,0
You put in your name.,1
So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?,0
You put in your address and make sure you're registered.,1
If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here.,1
Right?,1
Why don't you give back the money?,0
And they will ... they have ... they have clipboards.,1
We're kind of low-tech about it.,1
I think it would be a great gesture.,0
They have clipboards.,1
They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration.,1
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.,0
And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward.,1
And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.,1
So make no mistake.,1
This election is going to be close.,1
And you take a look at the people of Haiti.,0
They always are.,1
So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference.,1
I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.,0
So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com.,1
And you can volunteer and become involved.,1
If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.,1
And, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election.,1
And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.,0
And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it. ,0
They don't want you to help them anymore.,0
I'm excited about doing the work.,1
I'd like to mention one thing.,0
I'm excited about listening to Americans.,1
I'll continue to travel our country.,1
I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida.,1
Trump Foundation, small foundation.,0
I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase.,1
People contribute, I contribute.,0
That's kind of hard to believe.,1
So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities.,1
The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.,0
I don't get anything.,0
And that's what gets me excited.,1
So here's what I hope you will do.,1
When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?',1
I don't buy boats.,0
you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.',1
I don't buy planes.,0
If they say, 'Oh, that's great," get them registered.,1
If they say, 'Oh, my gosh.,1
What happens -- the money goes to them. ,0
How can you do that?',1
No, it was -- we put up the American flag.,0
if they're seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.,1
And that's it.,0
They put up the American flag.,0
And what we believe and what we're going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all so much.",1
And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction.,1
We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag. ,0
There was.,0
There was.,0
We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign.,1
This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.,1
I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses.,1
This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast.,1
And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is.,1
And, by the way... ,0
... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets. ,0
So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.,0
So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.,1
Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th.,1
And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars... ,0
Let me just explain.,0
Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.,0
You know what she should have done?,0
Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.,1
We've got to make every single day count.,1
And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator... ,0
... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so. ,0
We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote.,1
We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions.,1
What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?,1
You should have changed the law.,0
But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.,0
Now, as I said it the other night ... how many of you saw the debate?,1
Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary.,1
A little girl and a little boy.,1
I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump... ,0
So I think a lot about the future.,1
And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about ... well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it ... not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great ... but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.,1
My opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.',1
He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation.,1
I am sorry, I am looking at you.,1
But I will tell you, I sat there…,0
...,0
I don't see that.,1
That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know.,1
I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.,0
All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.,0
And, frankly, you should have changed the laws. ,0
And here's what he said.,1
If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws. ,0
I will look at it at the time.,0
He said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
I'm not looking at anything now.,0
I alone?,1
Well, we have learned that that's his way.,1
I'll look at it at the time.,0
One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly.,1
What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,0
First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.,0
The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.,0
It's so dishonest.,0
That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much.,1
But that's not how change happens in America.,1
It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president.,1
And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.,0
Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality.,1
But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.,0
I think they're going to see through it.,0
Not just the wealthy or the powerful ... all of us.,1
We'll find out on November 8th.,0
We see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it.,1
Maybe you taught kids to read, right?,1
Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive.,1
But I think they're going to see through it. ,0
If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.,0
So let me just give you one other thing.,0
So I talk about the corrupt media.,0
Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community.,1
I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.,0
She shouldn't be allowed to run.,0
It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.,0
And by extension, your country.,1
She should not be allowed to run.,0
And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never... ,0
Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things. ,0
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,0
I'll keep you in suspense.,0
OK?,0
How many of you ... just think back over your lives ... how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people.,1
The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year.,1
It's one of the best things about the American people.,1
We are doers.,1
Should have gotten it.,0
I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.,0
I think it's a disgrace. ,0
I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.,0
We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats.,1
Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.,0
We had Mosul.,0
But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.,0
We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.,1
This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today.,1
Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,0
Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.,1
The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.,0
People are starting to call out their services!,1
About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.,0
Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?,0
We announce we're going after Mosul.,0
I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?,0
These people have all left.,0
They've all left.,0
The element of surprise.,0
Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.,0
There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day.,1
So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.,0
All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.,0
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?,0
And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.,0
But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.,1
We've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements.,1
They want to look good.,0
He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.,0
That's why we have the great migration.,0
Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there.,1
They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member.,1
But she wanted to look good for the election.,0
I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I.,1
So they're going in.,0
And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard.,1
Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.',1
But who's going to get Mosul, really?,0
Isn't that great?,1
I think we should make that a national slogan.,1
Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps.,1
And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school.,1
They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs ... all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school.,1
I'm really grateful to them.,1
We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world.,1
Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda.,1
Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand.,1
We'll take Mosul eventually.,0
They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place.,1
But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.,0
Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.,1
Much, much tougher.,0
Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue.,1
Much more dangerous.,0
Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities.,1
Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith.,1
Going to be more deaths that they thought.,0
My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life.,1
Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas.,1
However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it?,1
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,0
They say, what do we need this for?,0
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,0
And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.,0
To be part of something bigger than ourselves.,1
To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.,1
And you know something very interesting?,1
Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.,0
Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that.,1
So we're now going to take Mosul.,0
It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people.,1
And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,0
Iran.,0
It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life.,1
Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.,0
It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people.,1
And service does something important for us as a society.,1
Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.,1
It's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent.,1
But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us.,1
But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,0
There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause.,1
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.,0
But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.,1
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way. ,0
I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call.,1
The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran. ,0
Wrong.,0
You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.',1
Wrong.,0
Wrong.,0
Chris, we don't gain anything. ,0
But sometimes it's hard to figure out.,1
Iran is taking over Iraq.,0
How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives?,1
And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do.,1
But that's not how it should be.,1
Everyone should be able to contribute.,1
Iran is taking over Iraq.,0
We don't gain anything.,0
If they did it by surprise…,0
So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back?,1
What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses?,1
What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives.,1
I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.,1
I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation.,1
We could have gained if they did it by surprise.,0
No, you are the one that's unfit.,0
We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy.,1
You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.,0
He said some beauties.,0
And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.,0
You do.,0
We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.,1
And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.,0
Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville.,1
If you think that was good, then you do.,0
He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America?,1
They fought a revolution.,1
Who are they?',1
And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place.,1
But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible.,1
Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.,0
Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.,0
If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service.,1
So here's what I plan to do.,1
First, let's triple AmeriCorps.,1
That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy.,1
It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.,1
It's finally time we get it done.,1
I agree with both. ,0
Which is a big mistake.,0
Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.,1
It's a catastrophe.,0
I mean...,0
... it's a mess.,0
Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it.,1
So let's lighten that burden.,1
Have you seen it?,0
If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country.,1
Have you seen it?,0
And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.,1
Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?,0
Now second, let's grow the Peace Corps.,1
Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations.,1
OK, so it hasn't fallen.,0
We've got to do more of that in the world today.,1
Take a look at it. ,0
We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people.,1
So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.,1
That's right.,0
And they are being slaughtered...,0
... because of bad decisions.,0
Well, Aleppo is a disaster.,0
It's a humanitarian nightmare.,0
Third, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages.,1
Right?,1
But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.,0
Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this.,1
I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world.,1
Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives.,1
And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.,1
I mean, what do you need, a signed document?,0
Now I also want to get older Americans more involved.,1
Take a look at Aleppo.,0
It is so sad when you see what's happened.,0
And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.,0
And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.,0
He -- he aligned with Russia.,0
He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.,0
Service isn't something only students and young people do.,1
I know that.,1
We gave them $150 billion back.,0
We give them $1.7 billion in cash.,0
So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55.,1
I mean, cash.,0
Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.,1
Bundles of cash as big as this stage.,0
And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment.,1
AmeriCorps is a full time commitment.,1
The Peace Corps is a full time commitment.,1
We gave them $1.7 billion.,0
The Armed Forces are a full time commitment.,1
But the Armed Forces has another model.,1
Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.,0
The Reserves ... right?,1
It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways.,1
So let's do something like that in the civilian space.,1
Let's call it the National Service Reserve.,1
And here's the idea.,1
They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.,0
We don't know who the rebels are.,0
If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call.,1
Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck.,1
We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.,0
We don't know who the rebels are.,0
Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families.,1
Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health.,1
And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.,0
You will then be sent into action.,1
But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.,0
Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term.,1
If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.,0
But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.,1
And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely... ,0
... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.,0
And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.,0
Lots of luck, Hillary.,0
And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family.,1
Thanks a lot for doing a great job. ,0
You won't have to make service your only priority.,1
But I just have to...,0
Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably.,1
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,0
And right now, they're in 32 countries. ,0
We should have -- wait one second.,0
We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.,1
I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer.,1
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.,0
And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs.,1
I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states.,1
A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.,0
And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.,0
There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it.,1
We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.,0
They are outplayed.,0
So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.,1
Now, she wasn't there.,0
I assume she had nothing to do with it.,0
Now, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent.,1
And you know what?,1
But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.,0
Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is. ,0
Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.,0
And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.,0
But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.,0
And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.,0
I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.,0
I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal.,1
And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.,0
Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps ... but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act.,1
President George H.W.,1
Bush created the White House Office of National Service.,1
We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.,0
To do that, we're taking back jobs.,0
And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service.,1
We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.,0
This should be something that we all can get behind.,1
It's very sad.,0
And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right?,1
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.,0
We used to be there.,0
It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can.,1
We've given it up.,0
Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election.,1
We've become very, very sloppy.,0
We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.,0
You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.,0
But we don't use those people.,0
Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go.,1
Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it?,1
Well, I'll do that, but ...,1
Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.,0
We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.,0
We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.,0
I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me.,1
I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart ... and this is one of them.,1
We use political hacks.,0
Thank you!,1
We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.,0
So we have to use our great people.,0
But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.,0
And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.,0
And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new. ,0
For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.',1
Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary. ,0
Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart.,1
But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met.,1
And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable.,1
We've heard this before.,0
We all deserve respect.,1
We all should listen to each other.,1
Thank you, Hillary.,0
Could I just respond? ,0
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.,0
I disagreed with him.,0
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.,0
We all can make our mark on the world.,1
I've been waiting for years.,0
Nobody does it right.,0
And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.,1
That's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan.,1
And frankly, now we're going to do it right. ,0
It's a course of action.,1
So here's what I want to do.,1
I'm cutting taxes.,0
I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency.,1
And I want you to help me bring our nation together ... to solve our problems, strengthen our communities.,1
To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States.,1
America is great because we are good.,1
We're going to grow the economy.,0
There are lots of examples.,1
We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations.,1
It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.,0
No, it's going to totally help you.,0
But I want everybody here to know that it can be done.,1
We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.,1
There are so many examples in this community and communities across America ... 39 days left.,1
And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
It's destroying our country.,0
It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.,0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down?,1
Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other?,1
You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.,0
Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.,1
Thank you and God bless you!",1
I am so [...] and so honored to be here.,1
Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker.,1
Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion.,1
If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.,0
But Obamacare has to go.,0
It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.,0
I have to confess ... we were putting together the [...] Rev.,1
Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,0
And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.,0
Walker was [...],1
But he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...],1
Bad health care at the most expensive price.,0
I am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction.,1
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. ,0
And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.,1
This church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...].,1
It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief.,1
Such a nasty woman.,0
In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls.,1
In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it.,1
In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.,1
Your husband disagrees with you.,0
She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.,0
It has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed.,1
Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father.,1
Doesn't work that way.,0
But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.,0
It's called "Make America Great Again.",0
Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain.,1
We're going to make America great.,0
And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses.,1
We have a depleted military.,0
It has to be helped, has to be fixed.,0
But we do more than pray.,1
We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.,0
We don't take care of our veterans.,0
As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.',1
We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.,0
That can't happen.,0
Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.,1
Our policemen and women are disrespected.,0
We need law and order, but we need justice, too.,0
Our inner cities are a disaster.,0
You get shot walking to the store.,0
Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves.,1
They have no education.,0
They have no jobs.,0
I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.,0
All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.,0
We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And there have been many others.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities.,1
Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.,1

And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers.,1
Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others.,1
From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.,1
It's been a hard year, hasn't it?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them.,1
We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.',1
What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.,1
But can you imagine, nine years old.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her.,1
Instead she's talking about graveyards.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes. ,1

I'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers.,1
They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless.,1
I know how I would feel.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now.,1
But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here ... they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other.,1
We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers.,1
We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.,1
I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson.,1

Being unafraid to face the facts.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing.,1
We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses.,1
We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations.,1
We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education.,1
And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.,1
Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.',1
As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that.,1
Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that.,1
But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both.,1
This is not an either-or question for America.,1

And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James.,1
Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king.,1
I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability.,1
But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown.,1
He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice.,1

The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up.,1

Now, I'm going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream.,1
See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences.,1
And that's okay.,1
People have different families, different views of the world.,1
But here's what I have noticed.,1
I have noticed that he always puts himself first.,1
And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family.,1
He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him.,1
And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people ... small businesses and workers and contractors.,1
And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

He started a printing business.,1
He printed fabrics for draperies.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he worked really hard.,1
He had a print plant in Chicago ... no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them.,1
And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You take the silkscreen.,1
You put it down.,1
You pour the paint in.,1
You take the squeegee.,1

You go across.,1
You lift it up.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table.,1
And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing.,1
It was before there was machines.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have met people.,1
I'm talking painters and plumbers.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He wouldn't pay them.,1
Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that?,1
Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.,1
And so I met one of the men.,1
I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no.,1
we're not going to pay it.,1
And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They had bought the material, They had provided the services.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Trump didn't care.,1
He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of.,1
Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand.,1
And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus ... a really crummy game that hurt people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...].,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is an important part of how we're going to protect.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, we're not going to let that happen.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it.,1
Contrast that ... contrast that with my opponent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street.,1
He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again.,1
Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen.,1
We need more rules, not fewer rules on them. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is not working for us.,1
But Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's the same ... the same idea that has failed us before.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down.,1
Well, we know that doesn't work.,1
We've been down that road.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids.,1
What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?',1
A lot of us wondered what he was hiding.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there.,1
Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns.,1
My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there.,1
You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So did any of you see the debate last Monday?,1
Well, I raised it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.',1
Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos?,1
Really.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.',1
Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place? ,1
In the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart.,1
But think about what that means.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right ... what's he saying about us?,1
But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America.,1
He says our military's a disaster.,1
Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.,1
Today in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes.,1
Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy ... the poster boy ... for the same rigged system that he would make even worse.,1
Just think about it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know.,1
And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more.,1
What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Really?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills.,1
We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times.,1
You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years.,1
We don't know what his taxes would be after that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009.,1
Show the American people your taxes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'll tell you another thing.,1
If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So what did we find out today?,1
Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He sent that money overseas.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You hear that all the time when he talks.,1
Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese.,1
So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets.,1
You know that, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country? ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented.,1
And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese.,1
I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.,1
And today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler ... about 700 more jobs, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job ... more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here ... Donald Trump said he didn't care.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him.,1
Well, I'll tell you where I stood.,1
I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And look what we got.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so we've got to keep building it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state.,1
You've got to get out there.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's what we've been doing.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump.,1
I know you know people.,1
I know you do.,1
And you've got to stage an intervention.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio.,1
In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people ... hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families. ,1
Now, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help ... to make sure you go out and talk to everybody.,1
And I know people want change.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's part of the American dynamic spirit.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We want change.,1
Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change ... it's just what kind of change.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top.,1
I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've never been called quitter.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I know I can't do it ...,1
I can't do it alone.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America.,1
And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are.,1
He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again.,1
And so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough.,1
But then, when he's cavalier ... and I'm not talking about basketball ... when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks.,1
He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons.,1
One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation.,1
And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does.,1
I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And what I learned ... if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program.,1
And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement.,1
I'm going to enforce.,1
And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that ... we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people.,1
I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will.,1
And Donald says he has a secret plan.,1
That he won't tell us about.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

No, here's what we're going to try to do.,1
We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations.,1
And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is not going to happen when I am president.,1

And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.,1
It's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him.,1

I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.,1

Now, one thing I know ...,1
I'll just say it because I know it's for sure ...,1
I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.,1

As a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant.,1
It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago.,1
And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night ... like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.,1
And that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is the basic bargain.,1
Now, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial ... and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, I will say, most American companies ... most ... are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else.,1
[Applause.],1
And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse.,1

It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because what I know will happen ... if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.,1
Now, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Now, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders ... but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have been moving off track for decades.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't need to tell you that.,1

And you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class.,1
So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives.,1
And when it doesn't, we don't, right?,1

So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.,1
But on the other side ... on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is the choice.,1
Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.,1
Look at Wells Fargo.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Really shocking, isn't it?,1
One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees.,1
It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.,1

Now, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It must be really terrible.,1
Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer.,1
Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos.,1
Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me.,1
It's just hard to figure.,1
But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.,1
Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation.,1
Imagine that.,1

Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Either way would have been acceptable, he said.,1
'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that.,1
At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall.,1
And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue.,1
Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue.,1
Union workers stepped up.,1
Communities like Toledo came together to make it work.,1
And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back. ,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits.,1
Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out.,1
When we stand together, we are stronger together.,1

To move our country forward.,1
Now, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said.,1
To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.,1
When I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers.,1
I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.,1
Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women.,1
And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

But it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again.,1
But he has targeted others as well.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.,1
That is not what we are in America.,1
And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are.,1
We are better than that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are bigger than that.,1
And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is.,1
And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will ... who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood.,1
You know better than that.,1
You are helping us move toward a more perfect union.,1
That has been the story of America at our best.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We don't have to make America great.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values ... and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country ... a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty.,1
This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The only way to rebuke this is to vote.,1
Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want you to vote for something.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here's what we're going to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families.,1
So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but ... there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And literally millions of kids were denied an education.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong ... in America, we're better than this.,1
Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.,1
And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place. ,1
So when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that.,1
I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights ... while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado.,1
And on the day ... on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on. ,1
So we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'm pretty clear about that.,1
I think we want new jobs with rising incomes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II.,1
And I have some specific ideas in mind.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.,1
They need to be upgraded and maintained and built.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is a question of competitiveness.,1
We have to have a competitive economy.,1
Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.,1
I do want to bring advanced manufacturing.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I heard Ted Strickland talking about that.,1
I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance.,1
There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing.,1
I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs.,1
I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing. ,1
And let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Some nation's going to have that title.,1
I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It should be us.,1
No question it should be.,1
We're going to fight climate change.,1
And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.,1
I'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And they're creating.,1
And they're going to want to export.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And what a shame it would be.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have innovated.,1
We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this.,1
And we're going to do it.,1
When I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer.,1
We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty.,1
And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas.,1
And the little girl raised her hand.,1
And I called on her.,1
And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?',1
I said, "Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make.",1
So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'll tell you something else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to do more to promote profit-sharing.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders.,1
You should be able to share in that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, there's a lot we can do.,1
And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I'm going to go where the money is.,1
And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country.,1
I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I will not raise taxes on the middle class.,1
Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.,1
Now, Donald Trump is the poster child for this.,1
Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.,1
Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos.,1
Who loses money running casinos?,1
Really.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I'll tell you what.,1
What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart.,1
He brought in Warren Buffett.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He said, 'Well, everybody does this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Warren Buffett does this.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so he put out a statement today.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here's what he said.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.',1
He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And none uses a carryforward.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited.,1
I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.',1
'Neither would Mr. Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more.,1
He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want ... so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.,1
Now, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so, don't.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's had a lot of them across Ohio.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He claims to be on the side of workers.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers.,1
He even had the nerve ... this is what kills me about him ... he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.,1
And the whole time he was hiding the truth.,1
Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs.,1
It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really ... it really gets me upset.,1
There's no justification for it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China.,1
They could have been made right here in Ohio.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.,1
So we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing.,1
And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others. ,1
We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms.,1
We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules.,1
Trump wants to do away with those.,1
He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He wants to do away with that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.,1
Well, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.,1
And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America.,1
If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.,1
We're also going to end the carried interest loophole.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've been trying to get that done for years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to get it done.,1
We've got a couple of different ways of doing it.,1
I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's going to end.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to reward the productive economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy.,1
That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?',1
Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade.,1
That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have.,1
Look.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to trade with the rest of the world.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're only 5 percent of the population of the world.,1
We've got to trade with the other 95 percent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.,1
And I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we're going to stand up.,1
I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.,1
And I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Does it raise American incomes?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
is it good for our national security?,1
And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests.,1
Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it.,1
I oppose TPP now.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'll oppose it after the election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'll oppose it as president.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world. ,1
I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is off the table forever.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There's an achievement gap already.,1
There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind.,1
I want this to be a true meritocracy.,1
I'm tired of inequality.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education.,1
And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school.,1
We need technical education for more young people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful.,1
I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses.,1
We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself.,1
We both remember that college was affordable.,1
And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities.,1
So here is our proposal.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free.,1
So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'll tell you, the other big problem ... how many of you already have student debt?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Oh, wow.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Practically every hand.,1
Well, here's what we're going to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt.,1
If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that ...,1
I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He didn't even have a credit card.,1
Didn't believe in that.,1
So he saved the money for me to go to college.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That was the arrangement.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then I told him I wanted to go to law school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He said, 'You're on your own.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't have any money for that.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.,1
So that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country.,1
And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve.,1
It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve.,1
You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train.,1
And then if you're needed, you're called up.,1
I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's how we get to know each other better. ,1
So I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together.,1
And I can't do any of this without your help.,1
I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As I said, go to iwillvote.com.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.,1
It's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe ... if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!,1
And I promise you this.,1
Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America ... the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans.,1
So please, join this campaign.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Be part of it for the next 29 days.,1
And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate!,1
Thank you, Ohio State!",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials.,1
Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida.,1

So thanks to the overflow crowd.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
About a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.',1
Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight.,1
It doesn't have a lot of special effects ... but it does have a lot of drama.,1
And here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it.,1
Right?,1
We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions.,1
We can transform our economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution.,1
And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.,1
Now, let me just say ... so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want you to know how far back he goes.,1
It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen.,1
And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.,1
I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people ... in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science ... he never wavered.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark.,1
And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Look at it this way.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we've really got to get this right.,1
And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti.,1
North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer.,1
We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They've always been destructive.',1
And that's true.,1
But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures ... and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Sea levels have already risen about a foot ... one foot ... in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes.,1
It's become a daily reality here in Miami.,1
You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.,1
So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand.,1
At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids ... like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders ... are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.,1
But there's also health consequences.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children.,1
And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought.,1
Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it's also about national security.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security.,1
The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia.,1
It's the largest naval installation in the world.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We need to take it seriously.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people ... in Washington, on the campaign trail ... who won't face what's happening right in front of us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change.,1

But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.,1
And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem..n. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alem..n. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign...because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science.,1
Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected ... please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.',1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House.,1
At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want you to be part of making it us.,1

Modernizing our electric grid.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Retrofitting buildings.,1
Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind...not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.,1
Now, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's actually pretty exciting.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America.,1
We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.,1
And while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We need to invest in resilient infrastructure.,1
Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative ... like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge.,1
Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours.,1
In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.,1
And here's something we don't talk enough about.,1
Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.,1
Well, he may not care ... but we do.,1

It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.,1
Climate change needs to be a voting issue.,1

And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.,1
So, I know it's easy to get cynical...especially about our politics.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I get that.,1
But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And just look, if you will ... look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now.,1
And do you know why?,1
Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.',1
So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world.,1
And there isn't anybody ... there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder.,1
I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States.,1

And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.,1
I also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.,1
I -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.,1
I was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.,1
And I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?,1
Well, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time.,1
And it is always a treat for either one of us to come.,1

And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too.,1
We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.,1
And you know, your vote can make all the difference.,1

I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It was about -- it was about issues, not insults.,1
We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America.,1
And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing.,1
We're supposed to bring people together.,1
We're supposed to unify our country.,1
We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.,1
And I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare.,1
And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.,1
You know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When they go low, we go high.,1
And I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.,1
And I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we're going to keep running this campaign.,1
I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.,1
And during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country.,1
We're going to be talking about what we can do together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.,1
His campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, "scorched Earth" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race.,1
Now, that just shows how desperate they are.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?,1
I don't care what he says about me.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I -- I -- I care about what he says about you.,1
And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.,1
Now, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, "locker room talk.",1
Well, you know what happened?,1
It just kind of happened spontaneously.,1
A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook.,1
I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They are coming together and they're saying, "That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.",1
But of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's insulted practically everybody.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And Trump said, "Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me.,1
And especially children.,1
It's really who Donald Trump is.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy.,1
His mother wrote to me.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Their parents, their grandparents were not around.,1
And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's only lived in the United States.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it is hard to explain to children.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them.,1
I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.,1
But here's what I also want to know.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going.,1
You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had.,1
So I believe differently.,1
We're going to invest in the middle class.,1
We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.,1
<i>Audience:</i> Hillary!,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Hillary!,1
Hillary!,1
Well, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They've had a really bad couple of weeks.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire.,1
He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad.,1
So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I grew up differently.,1
My father was a factory worker.,1
Well, my grandfather was a factory worker.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My father was a small businessman.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.,1
That's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure.,1
We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.,1
And we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos.,1
Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Do you know how hard that is?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But think about it, it means he's contributed zero.,1
Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He calls the United States military a disaster.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right?,1
Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America.,1
There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.,1
Now, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings.,1
Not American steel.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel.,1
If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it.,1
It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt.,1
And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.,1
Now, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.,1
And we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.,1

You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue.,1
If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue.,1

You know that.,1
So Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card.,1
And my response is pretty simple.,1
If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.,1

Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time.,1
We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.,1

And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.,1
That's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.,1
We're going to lift families out of poverty.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
What I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams.,1
I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.,1
That is how I was raised.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!,1
So we have about four weeks ago.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here is what I want to ask you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be.,1
Whether it is protecting our rights.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
People who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?,1
Those issues will be on the ballot.,1
They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.,1
And I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.,1
You know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Yeah, you, too, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience.,1
Right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And there is nothing I wouldn't do for them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing.,1
But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?,1
I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child.,1
Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America.,1
Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs.,1
That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.,1
That's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.,1
I got into this work so many years ago.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school.,1
And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.,1
It turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But here's what I want you to know.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It sounds pretty harsh.,1
It was difficult.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It made a profound impression on her life.,1
I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.,1
But, along the way, people were kind to her.,1
People helped her.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, you'll have to come right back home.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.,1
And so my mother always cared about other people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.,1
And we need to show each other more kindness and support.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.,1
We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children.,1
That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up ...,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's what I think we are called to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Nobody, nobody makes it alone.,1
Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children.,1
God bless you, thank you.",1
I have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail.,1
As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good.,1
And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances.,1
But with just two months to go until Election Day?,1
Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.,1
But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I talked with some old friends.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I spent time with our very sweet dogs.,1
I did some thinking.,1
The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.,1
People like me ... we're lucky.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When I'm under the weather ... now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs.,1
But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Millions of Americans can't.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?,1
Lots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use.,1
So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.,1
Lots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition.,1
So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They're on their own, aren't they?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

That's the story for too many people still in America.,1
When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own.,1
If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own.,1
If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.,1
Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home.,1
And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans.,1

Standing up for children has been the work of my life.,1
As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school.,1

My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts.,1

So in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future.,1
Let's talk about what really matters.,1
And here's my promise to you.,1

Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms.,1
Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her.,1
So she didn't get to go.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid.,1
Your life just isn't going to be worth very much.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And she and her family weren't rich.,1
They weren't powerful.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

That little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood ... abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But then something finally went her way.,1
The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school.,1
And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like.,1

After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.,1
The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone.,1
We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.,1
And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair.,1
My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.,1

So we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago.,1

The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported.,1
And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world.,1
And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities.,1
In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there.,1
I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old.,1

He was born with a rare form of dwarfism.,1
But he never let that stop him.,1
He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them.,1
But his family was always there for them and ... for him.,1
And he was the advocate for himself as he got older.,1
Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district.,1
And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet.,1
Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.,1

He was unbelievably good-looking.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense.,1
I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.',1
I couldn't agree more.,1
We've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We want paychecks.,1
We want the chance to contribute.',1
As president, I'm going to give ... give them that chance.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system.,1
So let's raise our standards.,1
For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought.,1
Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use.,1
It's like what Anastasia said about her sister.,1
She can communicate through a computer.,1
Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.,1
Third, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership.,1
And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities.,1
Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military.,1
It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us.,1
And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward.,1
Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.,1

Now, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story.,1
It's a story of a woman named Freia David.,1
Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much.,1
Freia has Down syndrome.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent?,1
Could she handle the job?,1
Would she even pass the six-month training program?,1
Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did.,1
And then ... then she excelled at that job for 32 years.,1
Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them.,1
The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out. ,1
Earlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It broke her heart.,1
One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor.,1
Her family hoped a few people might show up.,1
And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years.,1
The party lasted three hours.,1
And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you.,1

We know we are stronger together.,1
We believe in equality and dignity for all.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And that's what I intend to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Today is National Voter Registration Day.,1
And you see some signs people are holding.,1
'I Will Vote.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered.,1
And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.,1
And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina.,1

The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But more than that, it's hurt people.,1
It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted.,1
You're not really part of us.,1
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, they were pretty blatant about it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Make it harder for people of color.,1
Make it harder for the elderly.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And make it harder for the young.,1
Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about.,1
But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote.,1
That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions.,1
It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is.,1
But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote. ,1
I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for.,1
But early information is actually quite encouraging.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're seeing spikes in early voting.,1
And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up.,1
And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.,1
Now, I would love to see that.,1
Obviously, I hope people vote for me.,1
But I would love to see that because every election is about the future.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.,1
Now, last night I got a chance ...,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president.,1
And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund.,1

It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.,1
And during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?,1
'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her.,1

By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She was basically a maid.,1

And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show.,1
And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.,1
When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that.,1
In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food.,1
And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her.,1
She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Would you like this sandwich?,1

And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school.,1
She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early ... it sounds like Christine getting up so early.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school.,1
It sounds harsh, but not for my mom.,1
She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.,1
So when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We do need to make sure ... we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago.,1
It was just ... it was dark room.,1
There was no natural light.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens ... if you've ever seen one ... and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done.,1
And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker.,1
And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because ... when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year.,1
But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year.,1
Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I've talked to a lot of these women.,1
Sometimes I'll be at a caf.. or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me ... it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.,1
So I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we need to raise the national minimum wage and ... and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because ... number one, it's fair.,1
It's fair.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place.,1
It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people ... dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers ... across America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Some of them have come forward.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You can go to our website; you can see their stories.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's heartbreaking.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work.,1
It's really hard out there, isn't it?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And just listening to Christine's story ... getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job ... that's not an uncommon story.,1
We've made it really hard for a lot of people.,1
So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity ... because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I've heard so many stories.,1
They've told me ... people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick.,1
And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm.,1
And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.,1
Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want ...,1
I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way.,1
And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.,1
Now, how are we going to do that?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top.,1
We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes.,1
And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again ... not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That hasn't worked out so well.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to get back to first principles.,1
Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I'm excited about what we can do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I really am.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of ... all of Donald Trump's claims.,1
There were ... there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But here's a couple of things that caught my attention.,1
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes.,1
In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years.,1
And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns ... and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero ... he said that makes him smart.,1
Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We didn't come from millionaire families.,1
My husband's father ... his biological father died before he was born.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
His mother went to nursing school in order to support him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They struggled.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They worked hard.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My dad, as I told you, worked hard.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate.,1
We tried to give 10 percent to charity.,1
Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.,1
The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen.,1
I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that.,1
But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.',1
I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that?,1
What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
One who should never be president is the answer to that question.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared.,1
But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort.,1
And I said, 'Yeah.,1
You know what?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I did prepare.,1
And I'll tell you something else I prepared for.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.',1
So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here.,1
I believe we are stronger together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service.,1
I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS.,1
And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's unclear exactly what he is saying.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But words matter.,1

They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do.,1
They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.,1

Bernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd.,1
And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.,1
I'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran.,1
We ran a campaign about issues, not insults.,1
And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Thank you, Bernie.,1
Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.,1
Now, we're going to need some help in Washington.,1

Isn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families.,1

Climate change is real.,1
It's serious.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.,1
So there's a lot at stake.,1
And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before.,1

We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man ... he had saved up money, but I had to work.,1
I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay.,1
We were able to put it together.,1
It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.,1
And then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That ... we're done.,1
We can't help you.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I kept working.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans.,1
And I paid those loans back.,1
But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.,1
It's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Indeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.,1
And if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This is wrong.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business.,1
They want to be entrepreneurs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But they can't get credit because they have student debt.,1
Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.,1
We are also ... we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service.,1
And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Now, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars.,1
Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in.,1

Now, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website.,1
You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you.,1
You can choose whether you have student debt.,1

Well, we're going to be really explicit.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, we do have technology in America.,1
And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.,1
So, please, use this, you know?,1

But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote.,1
None of it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.',1
There is also a website.,1
Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered.,1
All the information is there.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again.,1
New Hampshire makes it easy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You can have same-day registration.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have ... specific help for certain groups of students.,1
I'll end with this story.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened.,1
You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart.,1
Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation.,1
Or maybe they had a health emergency.,1
And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Where can I get the $300 to fix the car?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Where can I find childcare?,1
How can I pay the doctor's bills?',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school.,1
We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping.,1
But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students.,1
So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out.,1
They didn't have to cut back.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams.,1
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it. ,1
So please make sure you come out and vote in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Thank you, all.",1
You know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes.,1
This work that you do through the dinner ... Al, you've done it now for 30 ... 30 years ... is such a labor of love.,1
You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.,1
This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.,1
And as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.,1
But, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith.,1
If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused.,1
It's a special honor to be here with Your Eminence.,1
Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying "If I only sat down with those who were saints, I'd be taking all my meals alone.",1
Now, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood.,1
But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats ... mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?,1
Now, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with.,1
I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.,1
And, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don't like what I'm saying feel free to stand up and shout "Wrong!",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
while I'm talking.,1
You know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.,1
You know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.,1
And it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know ... don't you think?,1
People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world.,1
Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a "four.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Maybe a "five" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.,1
You know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman?,1
Forty-five.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I digress.,1
Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's why it did take a village to write these jokes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
People say ... and I hear them, I know ... they say I'm boring compared to Donald.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I'm not boring at all.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely.,1
And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I get that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.,1
But every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans ... or, as we now like to call them ... Hillary supporters.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, some of my critics ... and I hear that too ...,1
<i>Audience Member:</i> Yeah.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Yeah.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They think I only say what people want to hear.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, tonight, that is true.,1
And here's exactly what you want to hear ... this election will be over very, very soon.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And look at this dais ... we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric ... this counts as a press conference, right?,1
It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.,1
It's a shame he's not speaking tonight.,1
I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.,1
And look at the dais ... we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we have Rudy Giuliani.,1
Now, many don't know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But, as the saying goes, "If you can't beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate.,1
Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.,1
There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump.,1
Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate.,1
And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, actually, I did.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's called preparation.,1
And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates.,1
And he says I don't have any stamina.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is four and a half hours.,1
I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.,1
Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway.,1
She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.,1
But I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate.,1
The bad news is, it's Mike Pence.,1
And it's been a long, long campaign.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.,1
And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic.,1
We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.,1
And if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.,1
How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee.,1
Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you ... you don't have to support the top of the ticket.,1
Don't worry about anyone besides yourself.,1
Just do what's in your own best interests.,1
So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I don't understand their unhappiness.,1
They say Donald doesn't have any policies.,1
He has no policies.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I keep hearing that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'd actually like to defend him on this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald has issues, serious issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Really, really serious issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either.,1
But speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Actually, it was a hearse.,1
But I ... but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health.,1
We've each released our medical records.,1
My blood pressure is 100/70.,1
His is unbelievably great.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.,1
My heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.,1
But Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.,1
But ... but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.,1
But this has really been a strange campaign.,1
You saw it last night.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You saw it again tonight.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first.,1
I kind of get it now.,1
As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.,1
But Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.,1
For example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same.,1
A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.,1
And here's another similarity.,1
The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's come together.,1
Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.,1
Donald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has to wait and see. ,1
But there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward.,1
It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.,1
And there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.,1
And when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president.,1
Don't forget ... school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.,1
Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Those appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other.,1
Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other.,1
And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service.,1
I'm not Catholic.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works.,1
And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis.,1
Or to embrace his message.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
His message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better.,1
But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch.,1
And that is ultimately what this dinner is all about.,1
And it's why it's been such a great honor to join you all again.,1
Thank you.",1
I am so excited about being here.,1
Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us.,1
Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support.,1
I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.,1
I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly.,1
And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [<i>inaudible</i>] for his pledge of allegiance.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And thanks to all the elected officials here.,1
And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!,1

It's almost hard to believe, isn't it?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There are only seven days left in this election.,1

So are you ready to vote?,1
Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?,1
I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate!,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families.,1
And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Just look around folks.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election.,1
Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world.,1
And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States.,1
I don't think the choice could be any clearer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have spent my career fighting for children and families.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee.,1
I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike.,1
I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent.,1
And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?',1
And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president.,1
And what he told the crowd ... it was a big crowd at Kent State University ...,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think every voter should hear.,1
Basically ... his name was Bruce Blair ... he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal.,1
There is no veto.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.,1
So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So is immigration.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't think so.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less.,1
I don't think that's right.,1
Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war.,1
We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.,1
Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University.,1
And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called ... well, but wait a minute, ... he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.',1
And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.,1
And then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Or what does he have against me?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But this is not new.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.,1
And here's what I want you to tell.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.',1
So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama ... literally better than anybody, I guess.,1
And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We work together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president.,1
But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because ... Any of you see the debates?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?',1
And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.,1
And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned ... some of this stuff is very upsetting.,1
I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can't just wish it away.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this.,1
I don't blame them.,1
If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest.,1
But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's not okay.,1
And look at what he does.,1
He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We just heard from Alicia.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant.,1
Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.',1
He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina.,1
He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat?,1
I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But you've got to ask: why does he do these things?,1
Who acts like this?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who.,1
And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down.,1
She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But what about our girls?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
What about girls watching all this?,1
What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth?,1
If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America?,1
And what about our boys?,1
This is not someone we want them looking up to.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl.,1
And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson.,1
Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite ... they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school.,1
And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together.,1
But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We'd talk about what was on her mind.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves.,1
And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down ... lifting people up and respecting women.,1
In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country.,1
So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected.,1
I want them to develop a good work ethic.,1
I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But that's what I want for every child.,1
I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families.,1
It will be the mission of my presidency.,1
I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?,1
So I know there's work to be done.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can't do it with just words alone.,1
We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified.,1
And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women.,1
I'm not going to repeat it.,1
But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women.,1
And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.',1
And then we heard his response.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them.,1
He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
'Look at her,' he said about one woman.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He said he did that ... he said he did that to 'inspect' them.,1
That was his word ... and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.',1
And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.',1

This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories.,1
And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this.,1
He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms.,1

Anybody watch the debate Wednesday night?,1
Well, that was the third and last time.,1
That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.,1
I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.,1
Really, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.,1
And because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together.,1
So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign.,1
And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We're going to invest in you and your families.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you. ,1
And we're also going to protect our children from gun violence.,1
We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.,1
But on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done.,1
He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, make no mistake.,1
By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost.,1
Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge.,1
You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.,1
That can never be allowed to happen here.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me.,1
Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.,1

That is great.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives.,1
We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.,1
That is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy.,1
More than 50 million millennials have registered.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know what that means?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news.,1
That means our future is in good hands.,1
And listen to this, because this is really exciting.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
More than 4 million people have already voted.,1

Including many people right here in Ohio.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election.,1
So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now.,1
People are coming together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.,1
People are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute.,1
That is my vision.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be.,1
Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.,1
And I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.,1
I want you to tell them that I want to be their president.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.,1
I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I believe that.,1
And I have seen that happen.,1
I want to be a good listener.,1
I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them.,1
I get that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I think anger is not a plan.,1
We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think that is what the country needs now.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that is what I will try to offer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
CLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That would not be fair.,1
It wouldn't be true.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My opponent has a different perspective.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out.,1
It's really trickle down on steroids.,1
I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that's what we're going to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years.,1
Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story.,1
He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.,1
And this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
Trump's suits were made in Mexico.,1
They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio.,1
Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.,1
He says that makes him smart.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place.,1
But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.,1
Now Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business.,1
We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
And I've set some big goals.,1
I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.,1
And enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education.,1
I want us to bring back technical education in high school.,1
I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.,1
And let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
Education should lift you up, not hold you back.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Too many young people are burdened by those debts.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford.,1
Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.,1
I also want to do more for apprenticeship programs.,1
I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place.,1
Thank you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
As I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors.,1
And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
Now the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I mean that's good for the entire family, right?,1
But the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.,1
So we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone.,1
And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard.,1
And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country?,1
What are our values?,1
What kind of future do we want to create together?,1
It is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that.,1
But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.,1
So I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I know you may still have questions for me.,1

So I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.,1
And the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there.,1
Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.,1
So I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days.,1

Thank you!",1
So we don't get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together.,1
But today was a real opportunity for us. ,1
I just want to make two quick points.,1
First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot. ,1
And in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president.,1

How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me. ,1
We have close elections in America.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before.,1
50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging. ,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours.,1

And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making.,1
Would you comment on that as well?,1
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election.,1
I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.",1
Wow.,1
It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh. ,1

You know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors. ,1
You know, sometimes it is just fleeting.,1
I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody.,1
And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously.,1

Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs .,1
Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic.,1
And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
What are you going to do about it? ,1
That is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you.,1
As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class.,1
We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you. ,1

I believe you've got to work for what you get in life.,1

For me, that starts by believing in our country. ,1
You know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many.,1
Do we have problems?,1

He refused to say he would respect the results of this election. ,1

You know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy.,1
And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us.,1
And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote.,1
And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

What does this tell us?,1
I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now.,1
People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.,1
And in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody.,1
I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective.,1
They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else.,1
It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right.,1

I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania.,1
And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries.,1
So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America?,1
And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years.,1
He says that makes him smart.,1
Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place.,1

That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks. ,1
I will tell you what.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything.,1
And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.,1
You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs.,1
And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign.,1
Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up.,1

That's a really good question.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, I am ...,1
I got a little bit of a chance.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.,1
But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said.,1
I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons.,1
He actually said, "Then why are we making them?",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.,1
He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, "I have a very good brain.",1
He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
[<i>Booing.</i>] No, Donald, you don't.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election.,1
Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that.,1
It's not a small thing.,1
I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats.,1
And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans.,1
I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office.,1
Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart.,1
Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ... the challenge posed by slavery ... and we fought a civil war.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I will tell you this.,1
I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because I have a very different vision of America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It is about lifting people up, not putting them down.,1
It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together.,1
And America is great because America is good.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Never forget that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans.,1
But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So we want an America where women are respected ... where our veterans are honored ... where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly.,1
And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security.,1
And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
A launch officer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.,1
And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him.,1
"Good luck.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I wonder if he even knows that a single ... a single ... nuclear warhead can kill millions of people?,1
That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, "not have his finger on the button.",1
And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation ... when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.,1
[<i>Cries of "No!,1
"</i>] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.,1
I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election.,1
Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America.,1
As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns.,1
Thousands more are injured.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's an average of 90 people a day dying.,1
Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes.,1
We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others.,1
I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.,1

But here's what I want to say.,1
If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This can't go on.,1
We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole.,1
And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time.,1
And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.,1
And look.,1

Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's sold out to them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone.,1
And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms.,1
How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?,1
So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me.,1
And I will stand up to them as president.,1
I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.,1
I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I was raised to believe that if you work hard ... and I believe in hard work ... you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America.,1
And I will never ever quit on you.,1
When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are.,1
We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done.,1
I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now.,1

Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high.,1
We're not going to be distracted.,1
We're not going to be knocked off course.,1
We know how much this election matters.,1
And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.,1
Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple.,1
They've announced it.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home.,1
It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it.,1
And it goes against everything we stand for.,1
So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military ...,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I mean, the list goes on and on.,1
It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Suppose you go to bed early.,1
Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors.,1
I want you to imagine.,1
So you get up early on the morning of the 9th.,1
And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

Oh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage.,1
And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here. ,1
It's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed ...,1
I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.,1
In New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote ... you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!,1
I know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day.,1
I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.,1
Now, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again! ,1
But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers.,1
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others. ,1
In fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator.,1
She is refusing... refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she?,1
She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up.,1
And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but ...,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She gets under his thin skin like nobody else.,1
Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is ... temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
During her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So she has really honed her skills ... listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families.,1
What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have to get back to listening respectfully.,1
We can disagree without being disagreeable.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
She knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her.,1
And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now.,1
And Maggie is leaving some big shoes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Colin is the person for that job.,1
You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.,1
He helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire.,1
Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient.,1
He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families.,1
So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now did anybody see the last debate?,1
I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president.,1
I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.,1
I think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And I get criticized for having so many plans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book ... oh, there's one copy right there!,1
It's called ... oh, another copy!,1
It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists.,1
We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I got to tell you.,1
During that debate, Donald said something.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He became the first person running for president ... Republican or Democrat ... who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.,1
Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is.,1
All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I take this really seriously.,1
And for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great ... something that ... something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are.,1
I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.,1
So when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone.,1

And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you make more than that, it will be debt free.,1
In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education.,1
This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future.,1
And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb.,1
Right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare.,1
We are going to work for paid family leave.,1

We are not living in the 1950s.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think.,1

Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be.,1

And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.',1
He told me that story.,1
I think your president should care about that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?',1
Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?',1
I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign ... where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.,1
What happened is trickle-down economics came back.,1
So here is what I am going to do.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are going to ... we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer.,1
We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
No ... no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, it will for him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is trickle down economics on steroids.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street.,1
He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year.,1
Now, I've pondered this.,1
I've really pondered this.,1
He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?,1
Has anyone here been to a casino?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've never heard of anybody.,1
So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families.,1
For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My dad was a small business owner.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

He worked really hard.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.,1
So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses.,1
This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Finally, he went to the police for help.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward.,1
If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?,1
So my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously.,1
But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together.,1

If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.,1

I also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree?,1
But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done.,1
And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people.,1
I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist?,1
Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, "weakened us as a people.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
His solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
<i>Audience:</i> Boo!,1
<i>Clinton:</i> That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?,1
And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.,1
That's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.,1
So please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.,1
Now, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.,1
I got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.,1
<i>Audience:</i> Happy birthday to you!,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, thank you!,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Thank you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Yeah, you know, you're right.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That last debate was like an early birthday present, right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But here's what I wanted you to remember.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.,1
You know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called "Stronger Together," and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth.,1
And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.,1
But in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.,1
I guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him.,1
But this is serious.,1
You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.,1
In America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election.,1
We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty.,1
And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press.,1
And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other.,1
We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right?,1
There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself.,1
So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?,1
I do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.,1
You know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Instead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Eight years, it's time to move on.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king.,1
We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I cherish that idea.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So here's the good news.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Americans are coming together.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here's something very exciting.,1
We have reached a milestone.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you know what?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.,1
But the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It really is.,1
It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind.,1
But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do.,1
I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted.,1
I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.,1
And you know, it's so important for Florida.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There are so many issues that we need to remind people about.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis.,1
And you know why?,1
Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And the ocean is rising.,1
And what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.,1
I have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.,1
I got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I want to tell you one other thing.,1
I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.,1
That's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, "a total disaster" and that our country is, again a quote, "looking dumb.",1
Really?,1
He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Here's another example.,1
He was asked if he would defend our allies.,1
He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would "love to be neutral.",1
Now, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I have a different view.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We stand with our allies.,1
We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.,1
So I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together.,1
And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses.,1
I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time.,1
And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've traveled all over the country.,1
And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Why?,1
Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.,1
And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code.,1
And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.,1
You know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
That's the vast majority of families.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So pay what you can afford.,1
But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt.,1
I view this as an investment.,1
And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.,1
And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's return technical education to high schools.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Let's do more with our community colleges.,1
Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer.,1
That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty.,1
And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It's a family issue.,1
If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And let's make childcare affordable.,1
And let's have more profit sharing.,1
And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card.,1
And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is.,1
I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because we want everybody's incomes to go up.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.,1
We're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.,1
Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?,1
For about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I've been really pondering this.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Think about it.,1
Has anybody here ever been to a casino?,1
<i>Audience:</i> Yes!,1
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.,1
He's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there.,1
Well I'll tell you what.,1
Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because I have a different idea.,1

And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I under-stand that.,1
I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.,1
But I also realized that anger is not a plan.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.,1
And I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.,1

We're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state.,1

And we're also gonna do more to help small business.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
My dad was a small businessman.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He worked really hard.,1
He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out.,1
You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I know how hard people in small business work.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I also know something else.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

But it's not just enough to grow the economy.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have to make it fairer.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote.,1
I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.,1
And one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare?,1

Thank you.,1

I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old.,1
And he stopped to talk to her and she said, "I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She said that, "I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off.,1
And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, "OK. You're fired.",1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is legal in America, still.,1
And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Do we really value families?,1
And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.,1
And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue.,1
It's a family issue.,1
If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.,1
Just about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Then deal me in.,1
And here's what else I want you to know.,1
It's fair to ask, "How are you going to pay for that?",1
That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask.,1
Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget.,1
I have proposed a very simple formula.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.,1
And for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief.,1
So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is trickle-down economics on steroids.,1
I profoundly disagree.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.,1
When you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.,1
Especially when you're running casinos.,1
I do not understand that.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.,1
So, we'll still wonder.,1
But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs.,1
And we can't afford that.,1
We need to keep building.,1
We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet.,1
The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down.,1
And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.,1
And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote.,1
I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when it was over, we actually got together.,1
What a novel idea.,1
We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.,1
Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year.,1
And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It makes no sense at all.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We have interest rates that are really low right now.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

You can buy a house for 3,4 percent.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much?,1
Twelve point seven.,1
Fourteen point one.,1
I got to tell you friends.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That is outrageous.,1
The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.,1

Look.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.,1
And that has to be our mission together.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.,1
So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together.,1
A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach.,1
Because we have so much divisiveness right now.,1
We've got to start listening to each other.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Respecting each other.,1
I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months.,1
To say that we need more of two things right now.,1
We need more love and kindness in America.,1
I don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one.,1
I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness.,1
Not by those who should have loved her, but by others.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job.,1
And that woman said, "I know you want to go to high school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.",1
Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift.,1
I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others.,1
And ...,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

There's a version of the golden rule in every major religion.,1
And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down.,1
The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up?,1
And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.,1
Because I want to be a president for all Americans.,1

Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So let's take that first step tomorrow.,1
If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need.,1

Well, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.,1
So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination.,1
They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.,1
So when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.,1
And I was also very, very grateful.,1

They didn't have that kind of insurance.,1
And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, "You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it.,1

So, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans.,1
Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called "Stronger Together" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.,1
And as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders.,1

I want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.,1
It's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together.,1

And in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition.,1
As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.,1
But I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it.,1

You know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded ...she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes. ,1

He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian.,1
He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people.,1
He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages ... and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I enlisted Jos..'s help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative.,1
And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and ... he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business.,1
He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Jos.. heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.',1
That is really gutsy.,1
And today was a perfect time to have Jos.. be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them. ,1
And today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers.,1
The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different.,1
Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes.,1
That is the way that he does business.,1
Now, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy.,1

I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman.,1
And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump ... provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted ... and then weren't paid.,1
I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.,1
So I'm grateful to Jos.. and I want to thank everyone else ... my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson.,1

No complacency here.,1
Nobody... nobody flagging.,1
We've got to get everybody out to vote.,1
And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support ... that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate. ,1

He basically said that he's not sure ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election.,1
Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously.,1

Secretary Clinton was introduced by her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and her husband and former US President, Bill Clinton.,1
Well, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th.,1
Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted.,1
It's great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many.,1

And there have been ups and downs in all that we've gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you ... your lives, your futures.,1
The problems that keep you up at night.,1
That's what I'm interested in, and that's what I'm going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
That's really what this election is about.,1
There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there.,1
So I want you to know ... now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right?,1
Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top ... or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.,1
You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I mean, he's such a downer, right?,1
And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy.,1
We can't let him get away with this.,1
But here's the good news.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But we are seeing Americans coming together ... Democrats, Republicans, independents ... to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country.,1
And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake.,1
Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because we also share a common vision.,1
Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?,1
And that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days.,1
We're going to honor people, not insult them.,1
Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population.,1

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home.,1
Get young people to stay home.,1
Get people of color to stay home.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Get the LGBT committee to say home.,1
It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for.,1
So you know how we're going to stop him?,1
By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.,1
We need everybody to turn out and vote ... women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life.,1

And here's some really good news.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
This is amazing.,1
More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.,1
And I want you not only coming out for me.,1
I want you to reelect our members of Congress.,1
And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this.,1
We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign.,1
I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.,1
But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning.,1
It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York.,1
Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember.,1
This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine.,1
Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Children weren't welcomed in school.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Donald Trump.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He walks right up to the stage.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation.,1
None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He wasn't a donor at all.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He had never given a single dollar to help build the school.,1
He just wanted people to think he had.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out.,1
No explanation.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
No donation.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now really, who does that?,1
What kind of person does that?,1
Really?,1
I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good?,1
Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.,1
Back in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school.,1
That was a program we used to have in New York.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament.,1
They were $5,000 short.,1
He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill.,1
At first the kids and their parents were excited.,1
Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke.,1
So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine.,1
Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000.,1
And the coach remembers this woman saying, "I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.",1
Now, I got to say, any of you see the debates?,1
Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Right?,1
But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And here's what the Washington Post concludes.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous.,1
He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away.,1
It was in large part a fa..ade.',1
And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.,1
Now, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But here's what we do know.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
He abuses his power.,1
He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.,1
And here's what else we know.,1
Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights.,1
And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees.,1
It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses.,1
So I want you just to think.,1
This guy works hard.,1
Works with his hands.,1
Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They called him names.,1
They even threw rocks and golf balls at him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It got so bad he ended up in the hospital.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing.,1
So finally he went to the police for help.,1
He was too scared even to come back to work.,1
And what did the Trump golf course do?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
They fired him.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels.,1
For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country?,1
We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love.,1
So here's what I'll do as president.,1
We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act.,1
And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives.,1
We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy.,1
LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything.,1
They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.,1
Now, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me.,1

We're going to talk about it.,1
We're going to reach out.,1

I've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults.,1
And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan.,1
Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year.,1
And it should be debt free for everybody else.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education.,1
It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford. ,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about.,1
And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. ,1
So this has to be our mission together ... doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Have you helped somebody else?,1
Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden?,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We do it individually. ,1
My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
Her own parents didn't want her.,1
Her own grandparents didn't want her.,1
But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself.,1
But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school.,1
You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.',1
And look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
But to my mother, it was a blessing.,1
So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down.,1
What matters is if you get back up.',1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0

We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we?,1
Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost.,1
Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for. ,1
Well we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind.,1
I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are.,1
And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country.,1
We are not going to forget any American!,1
But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow. ,1
This election is going to really set the course of our country.,1
There's no doubt in my mind.,1
Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me.,1
It's for us. ,1
When President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States.,1
And what does he find?,1
He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds. ,1
Wow, those were hard, hard times.,1
I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in.,1
But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch.,1
It didn't happen by accident.,1
We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened.,1
They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened. ,1
Elections have consequences for everything we care about.,1
And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future.,1
If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.,1
In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?',1
'Because my future depends on it,' they say. ,1
So tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning.,1
We have to heal this country.,1
We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other.,1
Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election.,1
I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president.,1
This election is different.,1
This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that. ,1
So I think we do need more love and kindness, right?,1
We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting.,1
I want to be a president for all Americans.,1
Not just some.,1
I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents.,1
I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me.,1
I want to represent everybody.,1
Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future. ,1
So it starts tomorrow.,1
If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com.,1
You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM.,1
We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout.,1
But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard. ,1
This is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work.,1
And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices.,1
We would love to see you.,1
Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls.,1
And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate.,1
Thank you.,1
And thank you.,1
I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.,1
It took a lot of courage to come here, Mae.,1
Thank you.,1
Thank you for being with us.,1
I also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton.,1
I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here.,1
And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.,1
Well, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him.,1
And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people.,1
He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.,1
I also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general.,1
Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party.,1
And State Senator Don Davis.,1
And I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with.,1
First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is "I have to talk to you about our farmers.",1
Very first thing he said.,1
Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today.,1
We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding.,1
And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected.,1
We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather.,1
We're getting more of it in more places.,1
And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared.,1
They're resilient.,1
But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.,1
And nobody knows more about weather than our farmers.,1
And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms.,1
You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres.,1
You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm.,1
And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.,1
And I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it.,1
And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it.,1
There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind.,1
And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.,1
That is my goal as your president.,1
I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead.,1
Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there.,1
I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people.,1
It was just extraordinary.,1
But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.,1
And, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field.,1
And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history.,1
And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen.,1
So last night was very special on lots of fronts.,1
And who knows?,1
Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days.,1
You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote.,1
And I think women are making up for that in this election.,1
So thank you.,1
Thank you so much for being here.,1
Are you ready to vote?,1
How many -- how many folks have already voted?,1
[<i>applause</i>],1
Well, that's really impressive.,1
Are you ready to volunteer these last few days?,1
Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor?,1
Have a governor who puts families first and your needs.,1
I know he'll do a terrific job. ,1
Are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate?,1
She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve.,1
And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?,1
You know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates?,1
Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.,1
But, you know, he kept saying things like, "Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?",1
Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.,1
I chose a different path.,1
I have spent my career fighting for kids and families.,1
And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady.,1
That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year.,1
And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines.,1
It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, "The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life.",1
I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf.,1
And the doctor said, "You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear.",1
Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments.,1
But they were expensive.,1
She didn't know what she was going to do.,1
And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said "I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program.,1
Maybe you can qualify for that.",1
Because it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it.,1
And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.,1
So, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter.,1
I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me.,1
She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina.,1
So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help.,1
When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.,1
As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it.,1
And many of them...,1
<i>Audience:</i> [<i>inaudible</i>],1
<i>Clinton:</i> Where you there?,1
God bless you.,1
That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there.,1
And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.,1
And everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting.,1
I plead to that.,1
You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, "Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again," right?,1
But I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs.,1
You get good ideas.,1
Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with.,1
I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground.,1
And that will enable us to get results for people.,1
And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.,1
And from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do.,1
Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you.,1
I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.,1
And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear.,1
The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President.,1
And it will be either me or Donald Trump.,1
And you know what else?,1
People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain.,1
The question is what kind of change are we going to have.,1
Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together?,1
So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind.,1
I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.,1
Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures.,1
Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos.,1
Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together.,1
Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way,1
A president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him.,1
Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope.,1
The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.,1
You know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are.,1
And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump.,1
If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous.,1
Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war.,1
And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote "I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had".,1
Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?,1
This is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point.,1
His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point.,1
You know, we have seen it over and over again.,1
We know his true self.,1
His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is.,1
He can't help himself.,1
So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?,1
Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign.,1
In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom.,1
Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country.,1
Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair.,1
He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.,1
Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins.,1
And Mae wasn't alone.,1
Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a "C" -- "C" for colored.,1
In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s.,1
They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color.,1
Think about that.,1
If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department.,1
If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?,1
And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the "Central Park Five.",1
These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.,1
Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids.,1
Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.,1
Also, someone else confessed to the crime.,1
So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.,1
To him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says.,1
Do we want this man appointing judges?,1
Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?,1
<i>Audience:</i> No!,1
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get.,1
He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.,1
He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories.,1
And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.,1
Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party.,1
Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.,1
They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, "Make America Great Again.",1
They said it's about preserving white identity.,1
And they placed their faith and hope in him.,1
You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?,1
It's not just about communities of color.,1
It's about young people.,1
It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated.,1
That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.,1
But it doesn't end there.,1
You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either?,1
Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent.,1
Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth.,1
And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.,1
So, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina.,1
I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is.,1
Now we have to decide who we are.,1
Right?,1
And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying.,1
We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
We want to lift people up, not tear people down.,1
We are called -- we are called.,1
In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we?,1
We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded.,1
And we know how hard that is.,1
When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.,1
Love your neighbor as yourself?,1
Well, first, you've got to love yourself.,1
You've got to respect yourself.,1
And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself.,1
I believe with all my heart that we are better than this.,1
And that's why I want to paint a different picture.,1
Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election.,1
We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.,1
We are not going to accept the status quo.,1
What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal.,1
People painted "vote Trump" on the side.,1
And then they set it on fire.,1
Who would do that to a house of worship?,1
In America, that can never be acceptable.,1
What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them.,1
And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence.,1
You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott.,1
So many.,1
We can't accept that as normal either.,1
So we are going to get to work.,1
I'm just telling you.,1
If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.,1
We're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country.,1
I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.,1
We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end.,1
It is wrong.,1
And I don't care whether you are black or white.,1
It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes.,1
It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that.,1
And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says "well the answer to our problems is more law and order.",1
He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division.,1
What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.,1
I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law.,1
And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists.,1
You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment.,1
Donald's always trying to say "oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment.",1
What nonsense.,1
Absolute nonsense.,1
But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.,1
And we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind.,1
Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this.,1
There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out.,1
We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind.,1
And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.,1
I don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue.,1
I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card.,1
Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.,1
But I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.,1
And we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.,1
And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities.,1
Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose.,1
We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.,1
Now it's fair to say "Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?",1
Ok, I'll tell you two things.,1
First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year.,1
You see, I come from the middle class.,1
My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days.,1
But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.,1
Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans.,1
And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is.,1
The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years.,1
And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy?,1
It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations.,1
I just think that's a bad, bad idea.,1
We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.,1
And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free.,1
Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else.,1
And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt.,1
And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.,1
But I don't think that every young person needs to go college.,1
If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships. ,1
There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want.,1
I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other.,1
Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not.,1
But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.,1
I don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does.,1
When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia.,1
It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together.,1
Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you.,1
You worked with somebody.,1
Look at this community.,1
Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year.,1
That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do.,1
I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early.,1
Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls.,1
Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.,1
You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday.,1
He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington.,1
As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does.,1
Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton.,1
He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man.,1
But I've been practicing.,1
I spent four years working with him.,1
I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.,1
So let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want.,1
Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there.,1
We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.,1
You know, there's something special about this place.,1
And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.',1
And that is what Detroit is doing ... you are rising up!,1
And that is exactly what we're going to do in America.,1
We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.,1
I'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan.,1
I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters.,1
I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell.,1
I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you.,1
Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.,1
Sheriff Benny Napoleon.,1
The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams.,1
Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here.,1
And to all who are present today.,1
And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because ... he's not only a real billionaire ... he's actually shared his profits with his employees.,1
Now, are you ready to vote on Tuesday?,1
Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote?,1
Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief?,1
Did any of you see the three debates that we had?,1
Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.,1
Now, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he?,1
And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States.,1
And I did practice my composure.,1
People said to me, well, how did you do that?,1
The things he was saying.,1
And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you.,1
I said, well, I did practice.,1
And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me.,1
So I was ready.,1
But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?',1
And you know, I don't want to brag.,1
But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?,1
And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing.,1
For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids.,1
And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had.,1
I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.',1
But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right?,1
She got on the internet.,1
She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance.,1
She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
Maybe you should look into it.',1
Turned out she was eligible.,1
She signed up.,1
She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way.,1
And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college ... because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.,1
I'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years.,1
Have I done something to help somebody else?,1
I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.,1
And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen ... the evil and the hatred of terrorism.,1
I saw it.,1
And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it ... our police, our firefighters, our EMTs.,1
And I'll tell you who else we got covered.,1
We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about.,1
All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger.,1
That was America at its best.,1
And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are.,1
We are not afraid.,1
We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.,1
As your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights.,1
I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can.,1
If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.,1
I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against.,1
That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America.,1
I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about.,1
It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful.,1
That is not the America that I believe in.,1
I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there.,1
I love our country, and I believe in the American people.,1
And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them.,1
You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded.,1
We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part.,1
And we believe America is great because America is good.,1
Never forget that.,1
If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further.,1
And I believe with all my heart.,1
That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.,1
And so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president.,1
I know ...,1
I know that ...,1
I know that a lot of people say that they want change.,1
Well, let me tell you this.,1
Change is inevitable.,1
There will be change.,1
The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? ,1
Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other?,1
I sure hope not.,1
That is not the America that I believe we are.,1
And so here is what I want to ask you to do.,1
I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors.,1
Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting.,1
I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting.,1
In fact, I don't know.,1
About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states.,1
But Michigan votes on Tuesday.,1
And I imagine ...,1
I imagine there are ... some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump.,1
Right?,1
I know.,1
I know.,1
I understand that.,1
I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late.,1
But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017.,1
And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol.,1
Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively.,1
Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.,1
Now, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are.,1
And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.,1
Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time.,1
And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.,1
Just last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt.,1
What is he talking about?,1
I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry.,1
And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.,1
If Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States.,1
We are a country founded on religious freedom.,1
That runs contrary to our Constitution.,1
We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair.,1
He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.,1
He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field.,1
I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?,1
Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins.,1
Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City.,1
She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent.,1
But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away.,1
You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored.,1
And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination.,1
And although they settled, they wouldn't change.,1
So the government had to take them back to court.,1
That's a pattern.,1
This is what happens time and time again with my opponent.,1
If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department.,1
If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?,1
He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution.,1
He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men.,1
Here's the latest example.,1
There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City.,1
It was called the Central Park Five.,1
Maybe some of you have heard of it.,1
There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14.,1
They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years.,1
Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids.,1
And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison.,1
It doesn't matter if you're innocent.,1
If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up.,1
No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.,1
So we can't trust him with our Constitution.,1
We can't trust him to obey the rule of law.,1
He has shown us who he is.,1
Now we have to decide who we are.,1
So let me paint you a different picture.,1
Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.,1
We have three big challenges.,1
Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity.,1
Number three, we've got to bring our country together.,1
We have got to overcome these divides.,1
We have to heal our nation.,1
And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.,1
I have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back.,1
We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign.,1
A church in Mississippi was burned this week.,1
Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire.,1
We can't let ... we can't let that happen.,1
What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable.,1
Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water.,1
Those are basics.,1
We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.,1
And it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II ... infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology.,1
Some people say we can't do that.,1
Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong.,1
They're wrong.,1
We have the best workers, the most productive workers.,1
We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce.,1
And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities.,1
And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America.,1
That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.,1
And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in.,1
And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs.,1
And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers.,1
We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children.,1
And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.,1
It'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other.,1
I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.,1
And that's what we're going to work for.,1
We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives.,1
This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent.,1
Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now?,1
Really.,1
We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.,1
And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities.,1
I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama.,1
And I want to be a really strong partner.,1
I'll compete a little with them.,1
I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.,1
But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer.,1
That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty.,1
And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women?,1
This is not a women's issue.,1
If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue.,1
It's a family issue.,1
And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card.,1
I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.,1
And one of the other big challenges we're going to take on ...,1
I am so excited about this.,1
I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues.,1
And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate.,1
So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year.,1
And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt.,1
And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it.,1
And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.,1
Now, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election.,1
I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.',1
I get that.,1
I understand that.,1
We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09.,1
Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out.,1
That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that.,1
I get it.,1
But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan.,1
Right?,1
Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work.,1
That's what I will do.,1
That's why we've put this all down.,1
It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com.,1
It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.',1
Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable.,1
I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started?,1
How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?',1
I believe in making lists.,1
Maybe it's a women's thing.,1
My husband said ... once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.',1
Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.,1
And ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids.,1
Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?",1
<i>Audience:</i> "Yes.",1
<i>Clinton:</i> "Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal?,1
I believe we can do this together.,1
My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
Well, no, nobody alone does anything.,1
When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country.,1
It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights.,1
None of them ... none of them were won by one person alone.,1
The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.',1
It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in.,1
Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone.,1
It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting.,1
That is how progress happens in America.,1
So really, it all comes down to you, my friends.,1
You have to vote.,1
Our progress is on the line.,1
Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line.,1
I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made.,1
I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet.,1
I'm proud that ... he and I are friends.,1
But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay.,1
You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.,1
Now, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over.,1
He's a lot taller than I am.,1
But I'm excited about what we can do.,1
I know this has been a tough campaign.,1
I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before.,1
They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with.,1
I get it.,1
It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what.,1
Michigan, you can make the difference.,1
All I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody.,1
If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text 'join,' J?o-i-n, to 47246.,1
Because when your children ... and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today.,1
When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.',1
An America where we build bridges, not walls.,1
And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.,1
Let's get to work.,1
Thank you.,1
Thank you, Detroit.,1
Thank you, Michigan.,1
God bless you.,1
I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation.,1
I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote.,1
I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program.,1
In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program! ,1
My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election.,1
But let me start with this.,1
I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go.,1
That's a good question! ,1
And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses.,1
I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them.,1
And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.,1
There is no case here.,1
And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this. ,1
Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America.,1
And did any of you see the debates?,1
Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country.,1
And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said.,1
I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons.,1
He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?',1
And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.,1
Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East. ,1
And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.',1
He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do.,1
No, he does not.,1
And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies. ,1
So, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future.,1
I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief.,1
And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that.,1
I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats.,1
And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve.,1
Donald Trump is different.,1
That's as serious as it gets. ,1
So today, I want to talk about our national security.,1
Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions.,1
And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election.,1
And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace?,1
How do you handle a crisis?,1
And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? ,1
We'll start with nuclear weapons.,1
Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair.,1
When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided.,1
And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons.,1
He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped.,1
And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well. ,1
One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program.,1
But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump.,1
'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. ,1
I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people.,1
These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. ,1
To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling.,1
President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.',1
That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age. ,1
So what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced?,1
And here's the thing with nuclear weapons ... as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it.,1
There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs.,1
The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire.,1
And that can take as little as four minutes.,1
That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal. ,1
Earlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering.,1
In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana.,1
His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order.,1
Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war.,1
Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty.,1
They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them.,1
Then they waited for the final order from the President.,1
Thankfully, it never came.,1
But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night.,1
As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. ,1
And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis?,1
We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation.,1
When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter.,1
When he's challenged in a debate.,1
When he sees a protestor at a rally.,1
When he's confronted with his own words.,1
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.,1
Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet.,1
And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. ,1
Now thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country.,1
But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself.,1
Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate.,1
And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other.,1
And I couldn't agree more.,1
That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11.,1
After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station.,1
And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan.,1
What kind of a person brags at a moment like that?,1
I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief. ,1
For me, I take this very personally, my friends.,1
Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11.,1
He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials.,1
And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero.,1
The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see.,1
Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers.,1
They had all lost friends.,1
In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe. ,1
That's what I did for eight years as a senator.,1
I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed.,1
And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that.,1
Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted.,1
They happen.,1
I'll tell you a quick story.,1
It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration.,1
And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room.,1
And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side.,1
And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration. ,1
So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision.,1
It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision.,1
You learn a lot about people in moments like that.,1
And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington. ,1
We made the decision to go forward, obviously.,1
Some of you might have been there.,1
But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there.,1
So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust?,1
Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call?,1
Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief. ,1
Now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us.,1
Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?,1
Now this may seem like an easy question.,1
If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it.,1
But apparently it's hard for Donald.,1
He has picked fights with our friends.,1
I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan... and he even picked a fight with the Pope.,1
And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership.,1
He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square.,1
Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia. ,1
He has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.',1
Obsolete?,1
NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world.,1
And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.',1
And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11.,1
We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan.,1
They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden.,1
Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back? ,1
And by the way...right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe.,1
They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere.,1
And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens.,1
Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression. ,1
Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City ... hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe.,1
And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail.,1
But maybe that's the point.,1
Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider ... is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ,1
As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.',1
Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald.,1
Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB.,1
He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet.,1
And It seems to be working. ,1
Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond.,1
He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama.,1
And it gets worse.,1
The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election. ,1
So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President?,1
Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin?,1
Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing. ,1
And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country.,1
A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election.,1
That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent.,1
With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer.,1
Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates.,1
The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election. ,1
When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be ... in their words ... 'the most reckless President in American history.',1
It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him.,1
It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair... stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government... temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform... unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.',1
I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election.,1
Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren.,1
And who is best to do that.,1
So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year.,1
It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name.,1
It's our future.,1
Our security.,1
Our values.,1
It's who we are as a country. ,1
Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart.,1
But the good news is: There's another vision for America.,1
Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified.,1
And it is big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down.,1
It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together. ,1
Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good.,1
That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents.,1
Because we believe in an America where women are respected.,1
An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly ... an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.... an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values... where everyone counts and everyone has a place.,1
Where the American dream is big enough for everyone. ,1
This goes way beyond policies and partisanship.,1
We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century.,1
About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids.,1
It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true.,1
A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans ... basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency. ,1
That's something to defend ... and to build on.,1
And, in the end, that's what this election is all about.,1
Here in Ohio, you can make the difference.,1
Early voting has already begun.,1
So now is the time.,1
Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward.,1
You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer.,1
Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same. ,1
Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time.,1
This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States.,1
And it truly is in your hands, as it should be.,1
When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.,1
A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us.,1
Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future! ,1
So let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us.,1
And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate.,1
Thank you.,1
