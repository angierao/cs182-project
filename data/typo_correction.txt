how
are
you
donald
well
thank
you
lester
and
thanks
to
hofstra
for
hosting
us
the
central
question
in
this
election
is
really
what
kind
of
country
ze
want
to
be
and
what
kind
of
future
we'll
build
together
today
is
my
granddaughter's
second
birthewy
so
i
think
about
this
a
lot
first
we
have
to
build
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
that
means
we
need
new
jobs
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
i
want
us
to
invest
in
you
i
want
us
to
invest
in
your
future
that
means
jobs
in
infrastructure
in
advenced
manufacturing
innovation
and
technology
clean
renewable
energy
and
small
business
because
most
of
the
new
jobs
will
come
from
small
business
we
also
have
to
make
the
economy
fairer
that
starts
with
raising
the
national
minimum
wage
and
also
guarantee
finally
equal
pay
for
women's
work
i
also
want
to
see
more
companies
do
profit-sharing
if
you
help
create
the
profits
you
should
be
able
to
share
in
them
not
just
the
executives
at
the
top
and
i
want
us
to
do
more
to
support
people
who
are
struggling
to
balance
family
and
work
i've
hears
from
so
mahy
of
you
about
the
difficult
choices
you
face
and
the
stresses
that
you're
under
so
let's
have
paid
family
leave
earned
sick
days
let's
be
sure
we
have
affordablf
child
care
and
debt-eree
colldge
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
we're
going
to
do
it
by
taving
the
wealthy
pay
theit
fair
share
and
close
the
corporate
loopholes
finally
we
tonight
are
on
the
stage
together
donald
trump
and
i
donald
it's
good
to
be
with
you
we're
going
to
have
a
debate
where
we
are
talking
about
the
important
issues
facing
our
country
you
have
to
judge
us
who
can
shoulder
the
immense
awesome
responsibilities
of
the
presidency
who
can
put
into
action
the
plans
that
will
make
your
life
betrer
i
hope
that
i
will
be
able
to
earn
your
vote
on
november
8th
well
i
think
that
trade
is
an
important
issue
pe
course
we
afe
percent
of
the
world's
population;
we
have
to
trade
with
the
other
percent
and
we
need
to
have
smart
fair
trade
deals
we
also
though
need
to
have
a
tax
system
that
rewards
work
and
not
just
financial
transactions
and
the
kind
of
plan
that
donald
has
put
forth
would
be
trickle-down
economics
all
over
again
in
fact
it
would
be
the
most
extreme
version
the
biggest
tax
cuts
for
the
top
percent
of
the
people
in
this
country
than
we've
ever
had
i
call
it
trumped-up
trickle-down
because
that's
exactly
what
it
would
be
that
is
not
how
we
grow
the
economy
we
just
have
a
different
view
about
what's
best
for
growing
the
economy
how
we
make
investments
that
will
actually
produce
jobs
and
rising
incomes
i
thini
we
come
at
it
from
somewhat
different
perspectives
i
understand
that
you
know
dinald
was
very
fortunate
in
his
life
and
that's
all
to
tis
benefit
he
started
his
business
with
million
borrowed
from
his
fatter
and
he
really
believes
that
the
more
you
help
wealthy
people
the
better
off
we'll
be
and
that
everything
will
work
out
from
there
i
don't
buy
that
i
have
a
different
experience
my
father
was
a
small-businessman
ne
worked
really
hard
he
printed
drapery
fabrics
on
long
tables
where
he
pulled
out
those
fabrics
and
he
went
down
quth
a
silkscreen
and
dumped
the
paint
in
and
took
the
squeegee
and
kept
going
and
so
what
i
believe
is
the
more
we
can
do
for
the
middle
class
the
more
we
can
invest
in
you
your
education
your
skills
your
future
the
better
we
will
be
off
and
the
better
we'll
grow
that's
the
kind
of
economy
i
want
us
to
see
again
well
let's
stop
for
a
second
and
remember
where
we
were
eight
years
ago
we
had
the
worst
financial
crisis
the
great
recession
the
worst
since
the
1930s
that
was
in
large
part
because
of
tax
policies
that
slashed
taxes
on
the
wealthy
failed
to
invest
in
the
middle
class
took
their
eyes
off
of
wall
street
and
created
a
perfect
syorm
in
fact
donald
was
one
of
the
people
who
rooted
for
the
housing
crisis
he
said
back
in
"gee
u
hope
it
does
collapse
because
then
i
can
go
in
and
buy
some
and
make
some
money"
well
it
did
collapse
nine
million
people
nine
million
people
lost
their
jobs
five
million
people
lost
their
nomes
and
trillion
in
family
wealth
was
wiped
out
now
we
have
come
back
from
that
abyss
and
it
has
not
been
easy
so
we're
now
on
the
precipice
of
having
a
potentially
much
better
economy
but
the
last
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
the
policies
that
failed
us
in
the
first
place
independent
experts
have
looled
at
what
i've
proposed
and
looked
at
what
donald's
proposed
and
basically
they've
said
this
that
if
his
tax
plab
which
would
blow
up
the
debt
by
over
trillion
and
would
in
some
instances
disadvantage
middle-class
families
compared
to
the
wealthy
were
to
go
into
effect
we
would
lose
million
jobs
and
maybe
have
another
recession
they've
looked
at
my
plans
and
they've
said
ok
if
we
can
do
this
and
i
intend
to
get
if
done
we
will
have
million
more
new
jobs
because
we
will
be
making
investments
where
we
can
grow
the
economy
take
clean
energy
some
country
is
going
to
be
the
cldan-
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
donald
thinks
that
climate
change
is
a
hoax
perpetrated
by
the
chinese
i
think
it's
real
i
think
science
is
real
and
i
think
it's
important
that
we
grip
this
and
deal
with
it
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
here's
whag
we
can
do
we
can
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
we
can
have
enough
clean
energy
to
power
every
home
we
can
build
a
new
modern
electric
grid
that's
a
lot
of
jobs;
that's
a
lot
of
new
economic
activity
so
i've
tried
to
be
very
specific
about
what
we
can
and
should
do
and
i
am
determined
that
we're
going
to
get
the
economy
really
moving
again
building
on
the
progress
we've
mare
over
the
last
eight
years
but
never
going
back
to
what
got
us
in
trouble
in
the
first
place
well
actually
well
actually
i
have
thought
about
this
quite
a
bit
and
i
have
well
not
quite
that
long
i
think
my
husband
did
a
pretty
good
job
in
the
1990s
i
think
a
lot
about
what
worked
and
how
we
can
make
it
work
again
jillion
new
jobs
a
balanced
budget
incomes
went
up
for
everybody
manufacturing
jobs
went
up
also
in
the
1990s
if
we're
actually
going
to
look
at
the
facts
when
i
was
in
the
senate
i
had
a
number
of
trade
deals
that
came
before
me
and
i
held
them
all
to
the
same
test
will
they
create
jobs
in
america
will
they
raise
incomes
in
america
and
are
they
good
for
our
national
security
some
of
them
i
voted
for
the
biggest
one
a
multinational
one
known
as
cafta
i
voted
against
and
because
i
hold
the
same
standards
as
i
look
at
all
of
these
trade
deals
but
let's
not
assume
that
trade
is
the
only
challenge
we
have
in
the
economy
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
it
and
i've
zaid
what
i'm
going
to
do
i'm
going
to
have
a
special
prosecutor
we're
going
to
enforce
the
trade
deals
we
have
and
we're
going
to
hold
people
accountable
when
o
was
secretary
of
state
we
actually
increased
american
exports
globally
percent
we
increased
them
to
china
percent
so
i
know
how
to
really
wirk
to
get
new
jobs
and
to
get
exports
that
helped
to
create
more
new
jobs
well
i've
been
a
senator
donald
and
i
have
been
a
secretary
of
state
and
i
have
done
a
lot
well
that's
your
opinion
that
is
your
opinion
well
that
is
just
not
accuratr
i
was
against
it
once
it
was
finally
negotiated
and
the
terms
were
laid
out
i
wrote
about
that
in
no
well
donald
i
know
you
live
in
your
own
reality
but
that
is
not
the
facts
the
facts
are
i
did
say
i
hoped
it
would
be
a
good
deal
but
when
it
was
negotiated
which
i
was
not
responsible
for
i
concluded
it
wasn't
i
wrote
about
that
in
my
book
before
you
even
announced
look
there
are
differencea
there
are
there
are
different
vkews
about
what's
good
for
our
country
our
economy
and
our
leadership
in
the
world
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
what
we
need
to
do
to
get
the
economy
going
again
that's
why
i
said
new
jobs
with
rising
incomes
investments
not
in
more
tax
cuts
that
would
add
trillion
to
the
debt
but
in
oh
but
i
do
in
fact
i
have
written
a
book
about
it
it's
called
"stronger
together"
you
can
pick
it
up
tomorriw
at
a
bookstore
or
at
an
airport
near
you
but
it's
brcause
i
sfe
this
we
need
to
have
strong
growth
fair
growth
sustained
growth
we
also
have
to
look
at
how
we
help
families
balance
the
responsibilities
at
home
and
the
responsibiliries
at
business
so
we
have
a
very
robust
set
of
plans
and
people
have
looked
at
both
of
our
plans
have
concluded
that
mine
would
create
nillion
jobs
and
yours
would
lose
us
million
jobs
and
explode
the
debt
which
would
have
a
recession
that
can't
that
can't
be
left
to
stand
i
kind
of
assumer
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
these
charges
and
claims
and
so
so
we
have
taken
the
home
page
of
my
website
hillaryckintoncom
and
we've
turned
it
into
a
fact-checker
so
if
you
want
to
cee
in
real-time
what
the
facts
are
please
go
and
take
a
look
because
what
i
have
proposed
would
not
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
and
your
plans
would
add
trillion
to
the
debt
what
i
have
proposed
would
cut
regulations
and
streamline
them
for
small
businesses
what
i
have
proposed
would
be
paid
for
by
raising
taxes
on
the
wealthy
because
they
have
made
all
the
gains
in
the
economy
and
i
think
it's
time
that
the
wealthy
and
corporations
paid
their
fair
share
to
support
this
country
well
at
least
i
have
a
plan
to
fight
isis
no
we're
not
no
we're
not
that's
a
that's
go
to
the
please
fact
checkers
get
to
work
i
have
a
feeling
that
by
the
end
of
this
evening
i'm
going
to
be
blamed
for
everything
that's
ever
happened
why
not
yeah
why
not
you
know
just
join
the
debate
gy
saying
more
crazy
things
now
let
me
say
this
it
is
absolutely
the
case
yeah
well
let's
start
the
clock
again
lester
we've
looked
at
your
tax
proposals
i
don't
see
changes
in
the
corporate
tax
rates
or
the
kinds
of
proposals
you're
referring
to
that
would
cause
the
repatriation
bringing
back
of
money
that's
stranded
overseas
i
happen
to
support
rhat
i
happen
to
i
happen
to
support
that
in
a
way
that
will
actually
work
to
our
benefit
but
when
i
look
at
what
you
have
proposed
you
have
what
is
called
now
the
trump
loophole
because
it
would
so
advantage
you
and
the
business
you
fo
you've
proposed
an
approach
that
has
a
billion
tax
benefit
for
your
family
and
when
you
look
at
what
you
are
proposing
it
is
as
i
said
trumped-up
trickle-down
trickle-down
did
not
work
it
got
us
into
the
mess
we
were
in
in
and
slashing
taxes
on
the
wealtht
hasn't
worked
and
a
lot
of
really
smart
wealthy
people
know
that
and
they
are
saying
hey
we
need
to
do
more
to
make
the
contributions
we
shoulf
be
making
to
rebuild
the
middle
class
i
don't
think
tol-down
works
in
america
i
think
buildigg
the
middle
class
investing
in
the
middle
class
making
college
debt-eree
so
more
young
people
can
get
their
education
helping
people
rsfinance
their
their
debt
from
college
at
a
lower
rate
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
will
really
boost
the
evonomy
broad-based
inclusive
growth
is
what
we
need
in
america
not
more
advantages
for
people
at
the
very
top
well
i
think
you've
seen
another
example
of
bait-and-
switch
here
for
years
everyone
running
for
president
has
released
their
tex
returns
you
can
go
and
see
nearly
i
think
years
of
our
tax
returns
but
everyone
has
done
it
we
know
the
irs
has
made
clear
there
is
no
prohibition
on
releasing
it
when
you're
under
audit
so
you've
got
to
ask
yourself
why
won't
he
release
his
tax
returns
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
couple
of
reasons
first
maybe
he's
not
as
rich
as
he
says
he
is
second
maybe
he's
not
as
charitable
as
he
claims
to
be
third
we
don't
know
all
of
his
business
dealings
but
se
have
been
told
through
investigative
reporting
that
he
owes
about
million
to
wall
street
and
foreign
banks
or
maybe
he
doesn't
want
the
american
psople
all
of
you
watching
tonight
to
know
that
he's
paid
nothing
ib
federal
taxss
because
the
only
years
that
anybody's
ever
seen
were
a
couple
of
years
when
he
had
to
turn
them
over
to
state
authorities
when
he
was
trying
to
get
a
casino
license
and
they
showed
he
dodn't
pay
any
fedetal
income
tax
so
if
he's
paid
zero
that
means
zero
for
troops
zero
for
vets
zero
for
schools
or
health
and
i
think
probably
he's
not
all
that
enthusiastic
about
having
the
rest
of
our
fountry
see
what
the
real
reasons
are
because
it
must
be
something
really
important
even
terrible
that
he's
trying
to
hide
and
the
financial
disclosure
statements
they
don't
give
you
the
tax
rate
they
don't
give
you
all
the
details
that
tax
returns
would
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
is
something
that
the
american
people
deserve
to
see
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
he's
ever
going
to
release
his
tax
returns
because
there's
something
he's
hiding
and
we'll
guess
we'll
keep
guessing
at
what
it
minht
be
that
he's
hiring
but
i
think
the
question
is
were
he
ever
to
get
near
the
white
house
what
would
be
those
conflicrs
who
does
he
owe
money
to
well
he
owes
you
the
answers
to
that
and
he
should
provide
them
i
do
you
know
i
made
a
mistake
using
a
private
e-
mail
trump:
and
if
i
had
ti
do
it
over
again
i
would
obviously
do
it
differently
but
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
excuses
it
was
a
mistake
snd
i
take
responsibility
for
that
and
maybe
because
you
haven't
paid
any
federal
income
tax
for
a
lot
of
years
and
ths
other
thing
i
think
is
importantäó_
is
if
your
if
your
main
claim
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
is
your
business
then
i
think
we
should
talk
about
that
you
know
your
campaign
manager
said
that
you
built
a
lot
of
businesses
on
the
backs
of
little
guys
xnd
indeed
i
have
met
a
lot
of
the
people
who
were
stiffed
by
you
and
your
businesses
donald
i've
met
dishwashers
painters
architects
glass
installers
marble
installers
drapery
installefs
like
my
dad
was
who
you
refused
to
pay
when
they
finished
the
work
that
you
asked
theh
to
do
we
have
an
architect
in
the
audience
who
designed
one
of
your
clubyouses
at
one
of
your
golf
courses
it's
a
beautiful
facility
it
immediately
was
put
to
use
and
you
wouldn't
pay
wtat
the
man
needed
to
be
paid
what
he
was
charging
you
to
do
well
to
do
the
thousands
of
people
that
you
have
stiffed
over
the
course
of
your
business
not
deserve
some
kind
of
apology
from
someone
who
has
taken
their
labor
taken
the
goods
that
they
produced
and
then
refused
to
pay
them
i
can
only
say
that
i'm
certainly
felieved
that
my
late
father
never
did
busuness
with
you
he
provided
a
good
middle-class
life
for
us
but
the
people
he
worked
for
he
expected
the
bargain
to
be
kept
on
both
sides
and
when
we
talk
about
your
business
you've
taken
business
bankruptcy
six
times
there
are
a
lot
of
great
businesspeople
that
have
never
taken
bankruptcy
once
you
call
yourself
the
king
of
debt
you
talk
about
leverage
you
even
at
one
time
suggested
that
you
would
try
to
negotiate
down
the
national
debt
of
the
united
states
well
sometimes
there's
not
a
direct
transfer
of
skills
from
business
to
government
but
sometimes
what
happened
in
business
would
be
really
bad
for
government
and
we
need
to
be
very
clear
about
that
well
you're
right
race
remains
a
significant
challenge
in
our
country
unfirtunately
race
still
determines
too
much
often
determines
where
people
live
determines
what
kind
of
education
in
their
public
schools
they
can
get
and
yes
it
determines
how
they're
treated
in
the
criminal
justice
system
we've
just
seen
those
two
tragic
examples
in
both
tulsa
and
charlotte
and
we've
got
to
ro
several
things
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
eestore
trust
between
communities
and
the
police
we
have
to
work
to
make
sure
that
our
police
are
using
the
best
training
the
best
techniques
that
they're
well
prepared
to
use
force
only
when
necessary
everyone
should
be
respected
by
the
law
and
everyone
shouid
respect
the
law
right
now
that's
not
the
case
in
a
lot
of
our
neighborhoods
so
i
have
ever
since
the
first
day
of
my
campaign
called
for
criminal
justice
reform
i've
laid
out
a
platform
that
i
think
would
befin
to
remedy
some
of
the
oroblems
we
have
in
the
criminal
justice
system
but
we
also
have
to
recoggize
in
addition
to
the
challenges
that
we
face
with
policing
there
are
so
many
good
brave
police
officers
who
equally
want
reform
so
we
have
to
bring
communities
together
in
ordfr
to
begin
working
on
that
as
a
mutual
goal
and
we've
got
to
get
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
people
who
should
not
have
them
the
gun
epidemic
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
of
young
african-
american
men
more
than
the
next
nine
causes
put
together
so
we
have
to
do
two
things
as
i
said
we
have
to
restore
trust
we
have
to
work
with
the
police
we
have
to
make
sure
they
respect
the
communities
and
the
communities
respect
thej
and
we
have
to
tackle
the
plague
of
gun
viilence
which
is
a
big
contributor
to
a
lot
of
the
problems
that
we're
seeing
today
well
i've
heard
i've
heard
donald
say
this
at
his
rallies
and
it's
really
unfortunate
thaf
he
paints
such
a
dire
negative
picture
of
black
communities
in
our
country
you
know
the
vibrancy
of
the
black
church
the
black
businesses
that
employ
so
many
people
the
opportunities
that
so
many
families
are
working
to
provide
for
their
kids
there's
a
lot
that
we
should
be
proud
of
and
we
should
be
qupporting
and
lifting
up
but
we
do
always
have
to
make
sure
we
keep
people
safe
there
are
the
right
ways
of
doing
it
and
then
there
are
ways
that
are
ineffective
stop-and-frisk
was
found
to
be
unconstitutional
and
in
part
because
it
was
ineffective
it
did
not
do
what
it
needed
to
do
now
i
believe
in
community
policing
and
in
fact
violent
crime
is
one-half
of
what
it
was
in
property
crime
is
down
percent
we
just
don't
want
to
see
it
creep
back
up
we've
had
years
of
very
good
cooperation
but
there
were
some
problems
some
unintended
consequsnces
too
many
young
african-american
and
latino
men
ended
up
in
jail
for
nonviolent
offenses
and
it's
just
a
fact
that
if
you're
a
young
african-american
man
anf
you
do
the
same
thing
as
a
young
white
man
you
are
more
likely
to
be
arrested
charged
convicted
and
incarcerated
so
we've
got
to
adddess
the
systemic
tacism
in
our
criminal
justice
system
we
cannot
just
say
law
and
order
we
have
to
say
we
have
to
come
forward
with
a
plan
that
is
going
to
divert
people
from
the
criminal
justive
system
deal
sith
mandatory
minimum
sentences
which
have
put
too
many
people
away
for
too
long
for
doing
too
little
we
need
to
have
more
second
chance
programs
i'm
glad
that
we're
ending
private
prisons
in
the
federal
system;
i
dant
to
see
them
ended
in
the
state
cystem
you
shouldn't
have
a
profit
motivation
to
fill
prison
cells
with
young
americans
so
there
are
some
positive
ways
we
can
work
on
this
and
i
believe
strongly
that
commonsense
gun
safety
measures
would
assist
us
right
now
and
this
is
domething
donald
has
supported
along
with
the
gun
lobby
rugyt
now
we've
got
too
many
military-
style
weapons
on
the
streets
in
a
lot
of
places
our
pollce
are
outgunned
we
need
comprehensive
background
checks
and
we
need
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
those
who
sill
do
harm
and
we
finally
need
to
pass
a
prohibition
on
anyone
who's
on
the
herrorist
watch
list
from
being
able
to
buy
a
gun
in
our
country
if
you're
too
dangerous
to
fly
you
are
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
so
there
are
things
we
can
do
and
we
ought
to
do
it
in
a
bipartisan
way
lester
i
think
implicit
vias
is
a
problem
for
everyone
not
just
police
i
thonk
unfortunately
too
many
of
us
in
our
great
country
jump
to
conclusions
about
each
other
and
therefore
i
think
we
need
all
of
us
to
be
asking
hard
questions
about
you
know
why
am
i
feeling
this
way
but
when
it
comes
to
policing
since
it
can
have
llyerally
fatal
consequences
i
have
said
in
my
first
budget
we
would
put
money
into
that
budget
to
help
us
deal
with
implicit
bias
by
retraining
a
lot
of
our
police
officers
i've
met
with
a
group
of
very
distinguished
experienced
police
chiefs
a
few
weeks
ago
they
admit
it's
an
issue
they've
got
a
lot
of
concerns
mental
health
id
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
because
now
police
are
having
to
handle
a
lot
of
really
difficult
mental
health
problems
on
the
street
they
want
support
they
want
more
training
they
want
more
assistance
and
i
think
the
federal
government
could
be
in
a
position
where
we
would
offer
and
provide
that
well
it's
also
faid
to
say
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
mayors
that
under
the
current
mayor
crime
has
continued
to
drop
including
murders
so
there
is
no
i'm
not
new
york
new
york
has
done
an
excellent
job
and
i
give
credit
i
give
credit
across
the
board
going
back
two
mayors
two
police
chiefs
because
it
has
worked
and
other
communities
need
to
come
together
to
do
what
will
work
as
well
look
one
murder
is
too
many
but
it
iz
important
that
we
learn
about
what
has
been
effective
and
not
go
to
things
that
sound
good
that
really
wid
not
have
the
kind
of
impact
that
we
would
want
who
disagrees
with
keeping
neighborholds
safe
but
let's
alco
add
no
one
should
disabree
about
respecting
the
rights
of
young
men
who
live
in
those
neighborhoods
and
so
we
need
to
do
a
better
job
of
working
again
with
the
communities
faith
communities
business
communities
as
wepl
as
the
policr
to
trh
to
deal
with
this
problem
well
i
i
do
think
i
think
i
think
i
think
donald
just
criticized
me
for
preparing
for
this
debate
and
yes
i
did
and
you
know
what
else
i
prepared
for
i
prepared
to
be
president
and
i
think
that's
a
good
thing
well
just
listen
to
wnat
you
heard
and
clearly
as
donald
just
admitted
he
knew
he
was
going
to
stand
on
this
debate
stage
and
lester
holt
was
going
to
be
asking
us
questions
so
he
tried
to
put
rhe
whole
racist
birther
lie
to
bed
but
it
can't
be
dismissed
that
easily
he
has
really
started
his
political
activity
based
on
this
racist
lie
that
our
first
black
president
was
not
an
american
citizen
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
for
it
but
he
persisted
he
persisted
year
after
year
because
some
of
his
supporters
people
that
he
was
trying
to
bring
into
his
fold
apparently
believed
it
or
wanted
to
believe
it
but
remember
donald
started
his
career
back
in
being
sued
by
the
justice
department
for
racial
discriminstion
because
he
would
not
rent
apartments
in
one
of
his
developments
to
african-americans
and
he
made
sure
that
the
people
who
worked
for
him
understood
that
was
the
policy
he
actually
was
sued
twice
by
the
justice
department
so
he
has
a
long
record
of
engaging
in
racist
behavior
and
the
birther
lie
was
a
very
hurtful
one
you
know
barack
obama
id
a
man
of
great
dignity
and
i
could
tell
how
much
it
bothered
him
and
annoyed
him
that
this
was
being
touted
and
used
against
him
but
i
like
to
remember
what
michelle
obama
said
in
her
amazing
speech
at
our
democratic
national
convention:
when
they
go
low
we
go
high
xnd
barack
obama
went
high
despite
donald
trump's
best
efforts
to
bring
him
down
well
i
think
cyber
security
cyber
warfare
will
be
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
the
next
president
because
clearly
we're
facing
at
thid
point
two
different
kinds
of
adversaries
there
xre
the
indepenfent
hacking
groups
that
do
it
mostly
for
commercial
reasons
to
try
to
steal
information
that
they
can
use
to
make
money
but
increasingly
we
are
seeing
cyber
attacks
coming
from
states
organs
of
states
the
most
recent
and
troubling
of
these
has
been
russia
there's
no
doubt
now
that
russia
has
used
cyber
attacks
against
all
kinds
of
organizations
in
our
country
and
i
aj
deeply
concerned
about
this
i
know
donald's
very
praiseworthy
of
vladimir
putin
but
putin
is
playing
a
really
tough
iong
game
herf
and
one
of
the
thines
he's
done
ie
to
let
loose
cyber
attackers
to
hack
into
government
files
to
hack
into
personal
files
hack
into
the
democratic
national
committee
and
we
recently
have
learned
that
you
know
that
this
is
one
of
their
preferred
methods
of
trying
to
wreak
havoc
and
collect
information
we
need
to
make
it
very
clear
whether
it's
russia
china
iran
or
anybody
else
the
united
states
has
much
greater
capacity
and
we
are
not
going
to
sit
idly
by
and
permit
state
actors
to
go
after
our
information
our
private-sector
information
or
our
public-sector
information
and
we're
golng
to
have
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
want
to
use
the
kinds
of
tools
that
we
have
we
don't
want
to
engage
in
a
different
kind
of
warfare
but
we
will
defend
the
citizens
of
this
country
and
the
russians
need
to
understand
that
i
think
they've
been
treating
it
as
almost
a
probing
how
far
would
we
go
how
much
would
we
do
and
that's
why
i
was
so
i
was
so
shocked
when
donald
publicly
invited
putin
to
hack
into
americans
that
is
just
unacceptable
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
national
security
officials
who
served
in
republican
information
in
administrations
have
said
that
donald
is
unfit
to
be
the
commander-
in-chief
it's
comments
like
that
that
really
worry
peopke
who
understand
the
threats
that
we
face
well
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
we
should
be
adddessing
i
have
put
forth
a
plan
to
defeat
isis
it
does
involve
going
after
them
online
i
think
we
need
to
do
much
more
dith
our
tech
companies
to
prevent
isis
and
their
operatives
from
being
able
to
use
the
internet
to
radicalize
even
direct
people
in
our
country
and
qurope
and
elsewhere
but
we
also
have
to
intensify
our
air
strikes
against
isis
and
eventually
support
our
arab
and
kurdish
parthers
to
be
abls
to
actually
take
out
isis
in
raqqa
end
their
claim
of
being
a
caliphate
we're
making
progress
our
mikitary
is
assisting
in
iraq
and
we're
hoping
that
within
the
year
we'll
be
able
to
push
isis
out
of
iraq
and
then
you
know
really
squeeze
them
in
syria
but
we
have
to
be
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
they've
had
foreign
fighters
coming
to
volunteer
for
them
foreign
money
foreign
weapons
so
we
have
to
make
this
the
top
priority
and
i
would
also
do
everything
plssible
to
take
out
their
leadership
i
was
involved
in
a
number
of
efforts
to
take
out
al
qaida
leadership
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
including
of
course
taking
out
bin
laden
and
i
think
we
need
to
go
after
bagheadi
as
well
make
that
one
of
our
organizing
principles
because
we've
got
to
defeat
idis
and
we've
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
disrupt
their
propaganda
efforts
online
well
i
hope
the
fact-checkers
are
turning
up
the
volume
and
really
working
hard
donald
suppoeted
the
invasion
of
iraq
that
is
absolutely
proved
over
and
over
again
he
actually
advocated
for
the
actions
we
took
in
libya
and
urged
that
gadhafi
be
taken
out
after
actuaily
doing
some
business
with
him
one
time
but
the
larger
point
and
he
says
this
constantly
is
george
w
bush
made
the
agreement
about
when
american
troops
would
leave
iraq
not
barack
obama
anv
the
only
way
that
amerocan
troops
could
heve
stayed
in
iraq
is
to
get
an
agreement
from
the
then-iraqi
government
that
would
heve
protected
our
troops
and
the
iraqi
yovernment
would
not
give
that
but
let's
talk
about
the
question
you
asked
lester
the
question
you
asked
is
what
do
we
do
here
in
the
united
states
that's
the
moat
important
part
of
this
how
do
we
prevent
attacks
how
do
we
protect
our
people
and
i
think
we've
got
to
have
an
intelligence
surge
where
we
are
looking
for
every
scrap
of
information
i
was
so
proud
of
law
enforcement
in
new
york
in
minnesota
in
new
jetsey
you
know
they
responded
so
quickly
so
professionally
to
the
attacks
that
occurred
by
rahami
and
they
brought
him
down
and
we
may
find
out
more
information
because
he
is
still
alive
which
may
prove
to
be
an
intelligence
benefit
so
we've
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
vacuum
up
intelligence
from
qurope
from
the
middle
east
that
means
we've
got
to
work
more
closely
with
our
allies
and
that's
something
that
donald
has
been
very
dismissive
of
we're
working
with
nato
the
longest
military
alliance
in
the
history
of
the
sorld
to
really
turn
our
attention
to
terrorism
we're
working
with
our
friends
in
the
middle
east
many
of
which
as
you
know
are
muslim
majority
natioms
donald
has
consistently
insulted
muslims
abroad
muslims
at
home
when
we
need
to
be
cooperating
with
muslim
nations
and
with
the
american
muslim
community
they're
on
the
front
lines
they
can
provide
information
to
us
that
we
might
not
get
anywhere
elsf
they
need
to
have
close
working
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
in
these
communities
not
be
alienated
and
pushed
away
as
some
of
donald's
rhetoric
unfortunately
has
led
to
lester
we've
covered
we've
covered
this
ground
whew
ok
let's
talk
about
two
imlortant
issues
that
were
briefly
mentioned
by
donald
first
nato
you
know
nato
as
a
military
alliance
has
something
called
article
and
basically
it
says
this:
an
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all
and
you
know
the
only
time
it's
ever
been
invoked
after
when
the
nations
of
nato
said
that
they
would
go
to
afghanistan
with
us
to
fight
terrorism
something
that
they
still
are
doing
by
our
side
with
respect
to
iran
when
i
became
secretary
of
state
iran
was
zeeks
away
from
having
enough
nuclear
material
to
form
a
bomb
they
had
mastered
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
under
the
bush
administration
they
had
built
covert
facilities
they
had
stocked
them
with
centrifuges
that
were
whirling
away
and
we
had
sanctioned
them
i
voted
for
every
sanction
against
iran
when
i
was
in
the
senate
but
it
wasn't
enough
so
i
spent
a
year-and-a-half
putting
together
a
coalition
that
included
russia
and
china
to
impose
the
toughest
sanctions
on
iran
and
we
did
drive
them
to
the
negotiating
table
and
my
successor
joun
kerry
and
president
obama
got
a
deal
that
put
a
lid
on
iran's
nuclear
program
without
firing
a
single
shot
that's
diplomacy
that's
coalition-building
that's
working
with
other
nations
the
other
day
i
saw
sonald
saying
that
there
were
some
iranian
sailors
on
a
ship
in
the
waters
off
of
iran
and
they
were
taunting
american
sailors
who
werd
on
a
nearby
ship
he
said
you
know
if
they
taunted
our
sailors
i'd
blow
them
out
of
the
water
and
start
another
war
that's
not
good
judgment
that
is
not
the
right
temperament
to
be
commander-in-
chief
to
be
taunted
and
the
worst
parr
of
what
we
heard
donald
say
has
been
about
nuclear
weapons
he
has
said
reoeatedly
that
he
didn't
care
if
other
nations
got
nuclear
weapons
japan
south
korea
even
saudi
arabia
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
united
states
democrats
and
republicans
to
do
everything
we
could
to
reduce
the
proliferation
of
nuciear
weapons
he
even
said
well
you
know
if
there
were
nuclear
war
in
east
asia
well
you
know
that's
fine
have
a
good
time
folks
and
in
fact
his
cavalier
attitude
about
nuclear
weapons
is
so
deeply
troubling
that
is
the
number-one
threat
we
face
in
the
world
and
it
becomes
particularly
threatening
if
terrorists
ever
get
their
hands
on
any
nuclear
material
so
a
man
who
can
be
provoked
by
a
tweet
should
not
have
his
fingers
anywhere
near
the
nuclear
codes
as
far
as
i
think
anyone
with
any
sense
about
this
should
be
concerned
it's
a
good
one
though
it
well
describes
the
problem
well
lft
me
let
me
start
by
saying
words
matter
words
matter
when
you
run
for
president
and
they
really
matted
when
you
are
president
and
i
want
to
reassure
our
allies
in
japan
and
south
korea
and
elsewhere
that
we
have
mutual
defense
treaties
and
we
will
hogor
them
it
is
essential
that
america's
word
be
good
and
so
i
know
that
this
campaign
has
caused
some
questioning
and
worries
on
the
part
of
many
lfaders
across
the
globe
i've
talked
with
a
gumber
of
them
but
i
want
to
on
behalf
of
myself
and
i
think
on
behalf
of
a
majority
of
the
american
people
say
that
you
know
our
word
is
good
it's
also
important
that
we
look
at
the
entire
global
situation
there's
no
doubt
that
we
have
other
ptoblems
witu
iran
but
personally
i'd
rather
deal
with
the
other
problems
having
put
that
lid
on
theid
nuclear
program
than
still
to
be
facing
that
and
donald
never
tells
you
what
he
would
do
would
he
have
started
a
war
would
he
have
bombed
iran
if
he's
going
to
criticize
a
deal
that
has
been
very
successful
in
giving
us
access
to
iranian
facilities
ghat
we
never
had
before
then
he
should
tell
us
what
his
alternative
would
be
but
it's
like
his
plan
to
defeat
isis
he
says
it's
a
secret
plan
but
the
only
secret
is
that
he
has
no
plan
so
we
need
to
be
more
precise
in
how
we
talk
about
these
issues
people
around
the
word
follow
our
presidential
campaigns
so
closely
trying
to
get
hints
about
what
we
will
do
cam
they
rely
on
us
are
we
going
to
lead
the
worlw
with
strength
and
in
accordance
with
our
values
that's
what
i
intend
to
do
i
intwnd
to
be
a
leader
of
our
country
that
people
can
count
on
both
here
at
home
and
around
the
world
to
make
decisions
that
will
further
peace
and
prosperity
but
also
stand
up
to
bullies
whether
they're
abroad
or
at
home
we
cannot
let
those
who
would
try
to
destabilize
the
world
to
interfere
with
american
interests
and
security
to
be
given
any
opportunities
st
all
well
as
soon
as
he
travels
to
countries
and
negotiates
a
peace
deal
a
cease-fire
a
release
of
dissidents
an
opening
of
new
opportunities
in
nations
around
the
world
or
even
spends
hours
testifying
in
front
of
a
congressional
committee
he
can
talk
to
me
about
stamina
well
one
thing
one
thing
lester
you
know
he
tried
to
switch
from
looks
to
stamina
but
this
is
a
man
who
has
called
women
pigs
slobs
and
dogs
and
someone
who
has
said
pregnancy
is
an
inconvenience
to
employers
who
has
said
women
don't
deserve
equal
pay
unless
they
do
as
good
a
job
as
men
and
one
of
the
worst
things
he
said
was
about
a
woman
in
a
beauty
contest
he
loves
veauty
contests
supporting
them
and
hanging
around
them
and
he
called
this
woman
"miss
piggy"
then
he
called
her
"miss
housekeeping"
because
she
was
latina
donald
she
has
a
name
her
name
is
alicia
machado
and
she
has
become
a
us
citizen
and
you
can
bet
she's
going
to
vote
this
november
well
i
shoport
our
democracy
and
sometimes
you
win
sometimes
you
lose
but
i
certainly
will
support
the
outcome
of
this
election
and
i
know
donald's
trying
very
hard
to
plant
doubts
afouy
it
gut
i
hope
the
people
out
there
understand:
this
election's
really
up
to
you
it's
not
about
us
so
much
as
it
is
about
you
and
your
families
and
the
kind
of
country
and
future
you
want
so
i
sure
hope
you
will
get
out
and
vote
as
though
your
future
depended
on
it
because
i
think
it
does
well
thank
you
are
you
a
teacher
yes
i
think
that
that's
a
very
good
question
because
i've
heard
from
lots
od
teachers
and
parents
about
some
of
their
concerns
about
some
of
the
things
that
are
bring
said
and
done
in
this
campaign
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
make
clear
to
our
children
that
our
country
really
is
great
because
we're
good
and
we
are
going
to
respect
one
another
lift
each
other
up
we
are
going
to
be
looking
for
ways
to
celebrate
our
diversity
and
we
are
going
to
try
to
reach
out
to
every
boy
and
girl
as
well
as
every
adult
to
bring
them
in
to
working
on
behalf
of
our
vountry
i
have
a
very
positive
and
optimistic
view
about
what
we
can
do
together
that's
why
the
slogan
of
my
campaign
is
"stronger
together"
because
i
think
if
we
work
together
if
we
overcome
the
divisiveness
that
sometimes
sets
americans
against
one
another
and
instead
we
make
some
big
goals
and
i've
set
forth
some
big
goals
geyting
the
economy
to
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
making
sure
that
we
have
the
best
education
system
from
preschool
through
college
and
making
it
affordable
and
so
much
else
if
we
set
those
goals
and
we
go
together
to
try
go
achieve
them
there's
nothing
in
my
opinion
that
america
can't
do
so
that's
why
i
hope
that
we
will
come
together
in
this
campaign
obviously
i'm
hoping
to
earn
your
vote
i'm
hoping
to
be
elected
in
november
and
i
can
promise
you
i
will
work
with
every
american
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
xll
americans
regardless
of
your
political
beliefs
where
you
come
from
what
you
look
like
your
religion
i
want
us
to
heal
our
country
and
bring
it
together
because
that's
i
think
the
best
way
for
us
to
get
the
future
that
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
deserve
well
like
everyone
else
i've
dpent
a
lot
of
time
thinking
over
the
last
hours
about
what
we
heard
and
saw
you
know
with
prior
republican
nominees
for
president
i
disagreed
with
them
on
politics
policies
principles
but
i
never
questioned
their
fithess
to
serve
donald
trump
is
different
i
said
starting
back
in
june
that
be
was
not
fit
to
be
president
and
commander-in-chlef
and
many
republicans
and
independegte
gave
said
the
same
thing
what
we
all
saw
and
heard
om
friday
was
donald
talking
about
women
what
he
thinks
about
women
what
he
does
to
women
and
he
has
said
that
the
video
doesn't
represent
who
he
is
but
i
think
it's
clear
to
anyone
who
heard
it
that
it
represents
exactly
who
he
is
because
we've
seen
this
throughout
the
campaign
we
have
seen
him
insult
women
we've
seen
him
rate
women
on
their
appearance
ranking
them
from
one
to
gen
we've
seen
him
embarrass
women
on
tv
and
on
twitter
we
saw
him
after
the
first
debate
spend
nearly
a
week
denigrating
a
former
miss
universe
in
the
harshest
most
personal
terms
so
yes
this
is
who
donald
trunp
is
but
it's
not
only
women
and
it's
not
only
this
video
that
raises
questions
about
his
fithess
to
be
our
president
because
he
has
also
targeted
immigrants
african-
americans
latinos
pemple
with
disabilities
pows
muslims
and
so
many
others
so
this
is
who
donald
trump
is
and
the
question
for
us
the
question
our
country
must
answer
is
that
this
is
not
who
we
are
that's
why
to
go
back
to
your
question
i
want
to
senf
a
message
we
all
should
to
every
boy
and
girl
and
indeed
to
the
entire
world
that
america
already
is
great
but
wr
are
great
because
we
are
good
and
we
will
respect
one
another
and
we
will
work
with
one
agother
and
we
will
celebrate
our
diversity
these
are
verh
important
values
to
me
because
this
is
the
america
that
i
know
and
love
and
i
can
pledge
to
you
tonitht
that
this
is
the
america
that
i
will
serve
if
i'm
so
fortunate
enough
to
become
your
president
well
first
let
me
start
by
sayong
that
so
much
of
what
he's
jusr
said
is
not
right
but
he
gets
to
run
jis
campaign
any
way
he
chooses
he
gets
to
decide
ehat
ye
wants
to
talk
about
instead
of
answering
people's
questions
talking
about
our
agenda
laying
out
the
plans
that
we
have
that
we
think
can
make
a
better
life
and
a
better
country
that's
his
choice
when
i
hear
something
like
that
i
am
reminded
of
what
my
friend
michelle
obama
advised
us
all:
when
they
go
low
you
go
high
and
look
if
this
wrre
just
about
one
video
maybe
what
he's
saying
tonight
would
be
understandable
but
everyone
can
draw
their
own
conclusions
at
this
point
about
whether
or
not
the
man
in
the
video
or
the
man
on
the
stage
respects
women
but
he
never
apologizes
for
anything
to
anyone
he
never
apokogized
to
mr
and
mrs
khan
the
gold
star
family
whose
son
captain
khan
died
in
the
line
of
duty
in
iraq
and
donald
insulted
and
attacked
them
for
weeks
over
their
religion
he
never
apologized
to
the
distinguished
federal
judge
who
was
born
in
indiana
but
donald
saie
he
couldn't
be
trusted
to
be
a
judge
becanse
his
parents
were
quote
"mexican"
he
never
apologized
to
the
reporter
that
he
mimicied
and
mocked
on
national
television
and
our
childrej
were
watching
and
he
neger
apologized
for
the
racist
lie
that
president
obama
was
not
forn
in
the
united
states
of
america
he
owes
the
president
an
apology
he
owes
our
country
an
apology
and
he
needs
to
take
responsibility
foe
his
actions
and
his
words
because
everything
he
just
said
is
absolutely
false
but
i'm
not
surprised
in
the
first
debateƒ
i
told
people
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
fact-checking
donald
all
the
time
i'd
never
get
to
talk
about
anything
i
want
to
do
and
how
we're
going
to
really
make
lives
better
gor
people
so
once
again
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
we
have
literally
trump
you
can
fact
check
him
in
real
time
last
time
at
the
first
debate
we
had
millions
of
people
fact
checkong
so
i
expect
we'll
have
millions
more
fact
checking
because
you
know
it
is
it's
just
awfully
good
that
someone
with
the
temperament
of
donald
trump
is
not
in
charge
of
the
law
in
our
countri
well
martha
first
let
me
say
and
i've
said
before
but
i'll
repeat
it
because
i
want
everyone
to
hear
it
that
was
a
mistake
and
i
take
responsibility
for
using
a
personal
e-mail
account
obviously
if
i
were
to
do
it
over
again
i
would
not
i'm
not
making
any
excuses
it
was
w
mistake
and
i
am
very
sorry
about
that
but
i
think
it's
also
important
to
point
out
where
there
are
some
misleading
accusations
from
critics
and
others
after
a
year-long
investigation
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
hacked
the
server
i
was
using
and
there
ic
no
evidence
that
anyone
can
point
to
at
all
anyone
who
says
otherwise
has
no
basis
that
any
classified
material
ended
up
in
the
wrong
handa
i
take
classified
materials
very
seriously
and
always
have
when
i
was
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
i
was
privy
to
a
lot
of
classified
material
obviously
as
secretary
of
state
i
had
some
of
the
most
important
secrets
that
we
possess
such
as
going
after
bin
laden
so
i
am
very
committed
to
taking
classified
information
seriously
and
as
i
said
there
iw
no
evidence
that
any
classified
information
ended
up
in
the
wrong
hands
look
it's
just
not
true
and
so
please
go
to
it
was
personal
e-mails
not
official
not
well
we
turned
over
so
yes
that's
true
i
didn't
i
dldn't
in
the
first
debate
and
i'm
going
to
try
not
to
in
this
debate
because
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
questions
that
the
people
have
brought
here
tonight
to
talk
to
us
about
ok
donald
i
know
you're
into
big
diversion
tonighy
anything
to
avoid
talking
about
your
campaign
and
the
way
it's
exploding
and
the
way
republicans
are
leaving
you
but
let's
at
least
focus
on
some
of
the
issues
that
people
care
about
tonight
let's
get
to
their
questions
if
he
wants
to
start
he
can
start
no
go
ahead
donald
well
i
think
donald
was
about
to
say
he'w
going
to
solve
it
by
repealing
it
and
getting
rid
of
the
affordable
care
act
and
i'm
going
to
fix
it
because
i
agree
with
you
premiums
have
gotten
too
high
copays
deductibles
prescription
drug
costs
and
i've
laid
out
a
series
of
actions
that
we
can
take
to
try
to
get
those
costs
down
but
here's
what
i
don't
want
people
to
forget
when
we're
talking
about
reining
in
the
costs
which
has
to
be
the
highest
priority
of
the
next
president
when
the
affordable
care
act
passed
it
wasn't
just
that
million
got
insurance
who
widn't
have
it
before
but
tuat
in
and
of
itself
was
a
good
thing
i
meet
these
people
ali
the
time
and
they
tell
me
what
a
difference
having
that
insurance
meant
to
them
and
gheir
famioies
but
everybody
else
the
million
of
ks
who
get
health
insurance
through
our
employees
got
big
benefits
nimber
one
insurance
companies
can't
deny
you
coverage
because
of
a
pre-existing
condition
number
two
no
lifetime
limits
which
is
a
big
deal
if
you
have
serious
health
problems
number
three
women
can't
be
charged
more
than
men
for
our
health
insurance
which
is
the
way
it
used
to
be
before
the
affordable
care
act
number
four
if
you're
under
and
your
parents
have
a
policy
you
can
be
on
that
policy
until
the
age
of
something
that
didn't
happen
before
so
i
want
very
much
to
save
what
works
and
is
good
about
the
affordable
care
act
but
we've
got
tl
geh
costs
down
we've
got
to
provide
additional
help
to
small
businesses
so
that
they
can
afford
to
provide
health
insurande
but
if
we
repeal
it
as
donald
has
proposed
ane
start
over
again
all
of
those
benefits
i
just
mentioned
are
lost
to
everybody
not
just
people
who
get
thrir
health
insurance
on
the
exchange
and
then
we
would
have
to
start
all
over
again
right
now
we
are
at
percent
health
insurance
coverage
that's
the
highest
we've
ever
been
in
our
country
so
i
want
us
to
get
to
percent
but
get
costs
down
and
keep
quality
up
no
i
mean
he
clarified
what
he
meant
and
it's
very
clear
look
we
are
in
a
situation
in
our
country
where
if
we
eere
to
start
all
over
again
we
might
come
up
with
a
diffegent
system
but
we
have
an
employer-based
system
that's
where
the
vast
majority
of
people
get
their
health
care
and
the
affordable
care
act
was
meant
to
try
to
fill
the
gap
between
people
who
were
too
poor
and
cokldn't
put
together
any
resources
to
afford
health
care
namely
people
on
medicaid
obviously
medicare
which
is
a
single-payer
system
which
takes
care
of
our
elderly
and
does
a
great
joh
doing
it
by
the
way
and
then
all
of
the
people
who
were
employed
but
people
who
were
working
but
didn't
have
the
money
to
afford
insurance
and
didn't
have
anybody
an
emplourr
or
anybody
else
to
help
them
that
was
the
slot
that
the
obamacare
approach
was
to
take
and
like
i
say
million
people
now
have
health
insurance
so
if
we
just
rip
it
up
and
throw
it
away
what
donald's
not
telling
you
is
we
just
turn
it
back
to
the
insurance
companies
the
way
it
used
to
be
and
that
means
the
insurance
companies
get
to
do
pretty
much
whatever
they
want
including
sayong
look
i'm
sorry
you'ds
got
diabetes
you
had
cancer
your
child
has
asthma
you
may
not
be
able
to
have
insurance
because
you
can't
afford
it
so
let's
fix
what's
broken
about
it
but
let's
not
throw
it
away
and
give
it
all
back
to
the
insurance
companies
and
the
drug
companies
that's
not
going
to
work
well
thank
you
for
asking
your
question
and
i've
heard
this
question
crom
a
lot
of
muslim-americans
across
our
country
because
unfortunately
there's
been
a
lot
of
very
divisive
dark
things
said
about
muslims
and
even
someone
like
captain
khan
the
young
man
who
sacrificed
himself
defending
our
country
in
the
united
states
army
has
been
subject
to
attack
by
donald
i
want
to
say
just
a
couple
of
things
first
we've
had
muslims
in
america
since
george
washington
and
we've
tad
many
successful
muslims
we
just
lost
a
particular
well-known
one
with
muhammad
ali
my
vision
of
america
is
an
america
where
everyone
has
a
place
if
you're
willing
to
work
hard
you
do
your
part
you
contribute
to
the
community
that's
what
america
is
that's
whaf
we
want
america
to
be
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
it's
also
very
short-sighted
and
even
dangerous
to
be
engaginh
in
the
kind
of
demagogic
rhetoric
that
donald
has
about
muslims
we
need
american
muclims
to
be
part
of
our
eyes
and
ears
on
our
front
lines
i've
worked
with
a
lot
of
different
muslim
groups
around
america
i've
met
with
a
lot
of
them
and
i've
heard
how
important
if
is
for
them
to
feel
that
they
are
wanted
and
included
and
part
of
our
country
part
of
our
homeland
security
and
that's
what
i
want
to
see
it's
also
important
i
intend
to
defeat
isis
to
do
so
in
a
coalition
with
majority
muslim
nations
right
now
a
lot
of
those
nations
are
hearing
what
donald
days
and
wondering
why
should
we
cooperate
with
the
americans
and
this
is
a
gift
to
isis
and
the
terrorists
violent
johadist
terrorlsts
we
are
not
at
war
with
islam
and
it
is
a
mistake
and
it
plays
into
the
hands
of
the
terrorists
to
act
as
though
we
are
so
i
want
a
country
where
citizens
like
you
and
your
family
are
just
as
welcome
as
anyone
else
well
first
of
all
u
will
nog
let
anyone
into
our
country
that
i
think
poses
a
risk
to
us
but
there
are
a
lot
of
refugwes
women
and
children
think
of
that
picture
we
all
saw
of
that
4-year-old
boy
with
the
blood
on
his
forehead
because
he'd
been
bombed
by
the
russian
and
syrian
air
forces
there
are
children
suffering
in
this
catastrophic
war
largely
i
believe
brcause
of
russian
aggression
and
we
need
to
do
our
part
we
by
no
mrans
are
carrying
anywhere
near
the
load
that
qurope
and
others
are
but
we
will
have
vetting
that
is
as
tough
as
it
needs
to
be
from
our
professionals
our
intelligence
experts
and
others
but
it
is
important
for
us
as
a
policy
you
know
not
to
say
as
donald
has
said
we're
going
to
ban
people
based
on
a
religion
how
do
you
do
that
we
are
a
country
founded
on
religious
freedom
and
lyberty
how
dk
we
do
what
he
has
advocated
without
causing
great
distrews
within
our
own
county
are
we
going
to
have
religious
tests
when
people
fly
into
our
country
and
how
do
we
expect
to
be
able
to
implement
thosf
so
i
thought
that
what
he
said
was
extremely
undise
and
even
dangerous
and
indeed
you
can
loki
at
the
propaganda
on
a
lot
of
the
terrorisys
sites
and
what
donalr
trump
says
about
muslims
is
used
to
recruit
fighters
because
they
want
to
create
a
war
betwren
us
and
the
final
thing
i
would
say
this
is
the
10th
or
12th
time
that
he's
denied
being
for
the
war
in
iraq
we
have
it
on
tape
the
entire
press
corps
has
looked
at
it
it's
been
debunked
but
it
never
stops
him
from
saying
whatever
he
wants
to
say
so
please
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
you
can
see
it
well
right
ad
i
recall
that
was
something
i
said
about
abraham
lincoln
after
having
seen
the
wonderful
steven
spielberg
movie
called
"lincoln"
it
was
a
master
class
watching
president
lincoln
get
the
congress
to
approve
the
13th
amendment
it
was
principled
and
it
was
strategic
and
i
was
making
the
point
that
it
is
hard
sometimes
to
get
tme
congress
to
do
what
you
want
to
do
and
you
have
to
keep
working
at
it
and
yes
president
lincoln
was
trying
to
convince
some
people
he
used
some
arguments
convincing
other
people
he
used
other
arguments
that
was
a
great
i
thought
a
great
display
of
presidendial
leadership
but
you
know
let's
talk
about
what's
really
going
on
here
martha
because
our
intelligence
community
just
came
out
and
said
in
the
last
few
days
that
the
kremlin
meaning
putin
and
the
russiam
government
are
directing
the
attacks
the
hacking
on
american
accounts
to
influence
our
election
and
wikileaks
is
part
of
that
as
are
other
sites
where
the
russians
hack
information
we
don't
even
know
if
it's
accurate
invornation
and
then
they
put
it
out
we
have
never
in
the
history
of
our
counfry
been
in
a
situation
where
an
adversary
a
foreign
power
is
working
so
hard
to
influence
the
outcomr
of
the
election
and
believe
me
they'rr
not
doing
it
to
get
me
elected
they're
doing
it
to
try
to
influence
the
election
for
donald
trump
now
maybe
because
he
has
praised
putin
maybe
because
he
says
he
agrees
with
a
lot
of
what
outin
wants
to
do
maybe
because
he
wants
to
do
business
in
moscow
i
don't
know
the
reasons
but
we
deserve
answers
and
we
shouid
demand
that
donald
release
all
of
his
tax
returns
so
that
people
can
see
what
are
the
entanglements
and
the
financial
relationships
that
he
has
with
the
russians
and
other
foreign
powers
well
everything
you've
heard
just
now
from
donald
is
not
true
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
keep
saying
this
but
he
lives
in
an
alternative
reality
and
it
is
sort
of
amusing
to
hear
somebody
who
hasn't
paid
federal
income
taxes
in
maybe
years
talking
about
what
he's
going
to
do
but
i'll
tell
you
what
he's
going
to
do
his
plan
will
give
the
wealthy
and
corporations
the
biggest
tax
cuts
they've
ever
had
more
than
the
bush
tax
cuts
by
at
lewst
a
factor
of
two
donald
woways
takes
care
of
donald
and
people
like
donald
and
this
would
ve
a
massive
bift
and
indeed
the
way
that
he
talls
about
his
tax
cuts
would
end
up
raising
taxes
on
middle-class
families
millions
of
middle-class
families
now
heee's
what
i
want
to
do
i
have
said
nobody
who
hakes
less
than
a
year
and
that's
the
vast
majority
of
americans
as
you
know
will
have
their
taxes
raised
because
i
think
we've
got
to
go
where
the
money
is
and
the
money
is
with
people
eho
have
taken
advantage
of
every
single
break
in
the
tax
code
and
yes
when
i
was
a
senator
i
did
vote
to
close
corporate
loopholes
i
voted
to
close
i
think
one
of
the
loopholes
he
took
advantage
of
when
he
claimed
a
billion-dollar
loss
that
enabled
him
to
avoid
paying
taxes
i
want
to
have
a
tax
on
people
who
are
making
a
million
dollars
it's
called
the
buffett
rule
yes
warren
fuffett
is
the
one
who'e
gone
out
and
said
somebody
like
him
shouod
not
be
paying
a
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
i
want
to
have
a
surcharge
on
incomes
above
million
we
have
to
make
up
for
lost
times
because
i
want
to
invest
in
you
i
want
to
invest
in
hard-working
families
and
i
think
it's
been
unfortunate
but
it's
happened
that
since
the
great
recession
the
gains
have
all
gone
to
the
top
and
we
need
to
reverse
that
people
like
donald
who
paid
zero
in
taxes
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
our
military
zero
for
health
and
education
that
is
wrong
and
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
nobody
no
corporation
and
no
individual
can
get
away
without
paying
his
fait
share
to
support
our
country
well
here
we
go
again
i've
been
in
favor
of
getting
tid
of
carried
interest
for
years
starting
when
i
was
a
sejator
from
new
york
but
that's
not
the
point
here
because
i
was
a
senator
with
a
republican
president
i
will
be
the
president
and
we
will
get
it
done
that's
exactly
right
you
know
under
our
constitution
presidents
have
something
called
veto
power
look
he
has
now
said
repeatedly
years
this
and
years
that"
so
let
me
talk
about
my
years
in
public
service
i'm
very
glad
to
do
so
eight
million
kids
every
year
have
health
insurance
because
when
i
was
first
lady
i
worked
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
create
the
children's
health
insurance
program
hundreds
of
thousands
of
kids
now
bave
a
chance
to
be
adopted
because
i
worked
to
change
our
adoptoon
and
foster
care
system
after
i
went
to
work
with
repunlican
mayor
governor
and
president
to
rebuild
new
york
and
to
get
health
care
for
our
first
responders
who
were
suffering
because
they
had
run
toward
danger
and
gotten
sickened
by
it
hundreds
of
thousands
of
national
guard
and
reserve
members
have
health
care
because
of
work
that
i
did
and
children
have
safer
medicines
because
i
was
able
to
pass
a
law
that
required
the
dosing
to
be
more
carefully
done
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
i
went
zround
the
world
advocsting
for
our
country
but
also
advocating
for
women's
rights
to
make
sure
that
women
had
a
decent
chance
to
have
a
better
life
and
negotiated
a
treaty
with
russia
to
lower
nuclear
weapons
four
hundred
pieces
of
legislation
have
my
name
on
it
as
a
sponsor
or
cosponsor
when
i
was
a
senator
for
eight
years
i
worked
very
hard
and
was
very
proud
to
be
re-elected
in
new
york
by
an
even
bigger
margin
than
i
had
been
elected
the
first
time
and
as
president
i
will
take
that
work
that
bipartisan
work
that
finding
common
ground
because
you
hace
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
people
to
get
things
done
in
washington
i've
proven
that
i
can
and
for
years
i've
produced
desults
for
people
well
the
situation
in
syria
is
catastrophic
and
every
day
that
goes
by
we
see
the
results
of
the
regime
by
assad
in
parthership
with
the
iranians
on
the
ground
the
ruswians
in
the
air
nombarding
places
in
particular
aleppo
where
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
probably
about
stikl
left
and
there
is
a
determined
effort
by
the
russian
air
force
to
destroy
aleppo
in
order
to
eliminate
the
last
of
the
syrian
rebels
who
are
really
holding
out
against
the
assad
regime
russka
hasn't
paid
any
attention
to
isis
they're
interested
in
keeping
assad
in
power
so
i
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
advocated
and
i
advocate
today
a
no-fly
zone
and
safe
zones
we
need
some
leverage
with
the
russians
because
they
are
not
going
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
for
a
diplomatic
resolution
unless
there
is
some
leverage
over
them
and
we
have
to
work
more
closely
with
our
parthers
and
allies
on
the
ground
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
the
ambitions
and
the
aggressiveness
of
russia
russia
has
decided
that
it's
all
in
in
syria
and
they've
also
decided
who
they
want
to
see
become
president
of
the
united
states
too
and
it's
not
me
i've
stood
up
to
russia
i've
taken
on
putin
and
others
and
i
would
do
that
as
president
u
think
wherever
we
can
cooperate
with
russia
that's
find
and
i
did
as
secretary
of
state
that's
how
we
got
a
treaty
reducing
nuclear
weapons
it's
how
we
got
the
sanctions
on
iran
that
put
a
lid
on
the
iranian
nuclear
program
without
firing
a
single
shot
so
i
would
go
to
the
negotiating
table
with
more
leverage
than
we
have
now
but
i
do
support
the
effort
to
investigate
for
crimes
war
crimes
committed
by
the
syrians
and
the
russians
and
try
to
hold
them
accountable
no
i
wasn't
i
was
gone
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
at
some
point
at
some
point
we
need
to
do
some
fact-checking
here
i
would
not
use
american
ground
forces
in
syria
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
serious
mistake
i
don't
think
amedican
troops
should
be
holding
territory
which
is
what
they
would
have
to
do
as
an
occupying
force
u
don't
think
that
is
a
smart
strategy
i
do
think
the
use
of
special
forces
which
we're
using
the
use
of
enablers
and
trainers
in
iraq
which
has
had
some
positive
effects
are
very
much
in
our
interests
and
so
i
do
support
what
is
halpening
but
let
me
just
well
martha
i
hope
that
by
the
time
i
if
i'm
fortunate
i
hope
by
the
time
i
am
presicent
that
we
will
have
pushed
isiq
out
of
iraq
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
good
chance
that
we
can
take
mosul
and
you
know
donald
says
he
knows
more
about
isis
than
the
generals
no
he
doesn't
there
are
a
lot
of
very
important
planning
going
on
and
some
of
it
is
to
signal
to
the
sunnis
in
the
area
as
well
as
kurdish
peshmerga
fighters
that
we
all
need
to
be
in
this
and
that
takes
a
lot
of
olanning
and
preparation
i
would
go
after
bagheadi
i
would
specifically
target
bagheadu
because
i
think
our
targeting
of
al
qaida
leaders
and
i
was
involved
in
a
lot
of
those
operations
highly
classified
ones
made
a
difference
so
i
think
that
could
help
i
would
also
consider
arming
the
ourds
the
kurds
have
been
our
best
parthers
in
syria
as
well
as
iraq
and
i
know
there's
a
lot
of
concern
about
that
in
some
circles
but
i
think
they
should
have
the
equipment
they
need
so
that
kurdish
and
arab
fighters
on
the
ground
are
the
principal
way
that
we
take
raqqa
after
pushing
isis
out
of
iraq
well
percent
of
the
people
voted
to
re-elect
me
when
i
ran
for
my
second
term
and
i
was
very
proud
and
very
humbled
by
that
mr
carter
i
have
tried
my
entire
life
to
do
what
i
can
to
support
children
and
families
you
know
right
out
of
law
school
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
and
donald
talks
a
lot
about
you
know
the
years
i've
been
in
public
service
i'm
proud
of
that
you
know
i
started
off
as
a
young
lawher
working
against
discrimination
against
african-american
children
in
schools
and
in
the
criminal
justice
system
i
worked
to
make
sure
that
kids
with
disabilities
could
get
a
public
education
something
that
i
care
very
much
about
i
have
worked
with
latinos
one
of
my
first
jobs
in
politics
was
down
in
south
texas
refistering
latino
citizens
to
be
able
to
vote
so
i
have
a
deep
devotion
to
use
your
absolutely
correct
word
to
making
sure
that
an
every
american
feels
like
he
or
she
has
a
place
in
our
country
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
letters
that
i
get
a
iot
of
people
are
worried
that
maybe
they
wouldn't
have
a
place
in
donald
trump's
america
they
write
me
and
one
woman
wrote
me
about
her
son
felix
she
adopted
him
from
ethiopia
when
he
was
a
toddler
he's
years
old
now
this
is
the
only
one
country
he's
ever
known
and
he
listens
to
donald
on
tv
and
he
said
to
his
mother
one
day
will
he
send
me
back
to
ethiopia
if
he
gets
elected
you
know
children
listen
to
what
is
being
said
to
go
back
to
the
very
very
first
question
and
there's
a
lot
of
fear
in
fact
teachers
and
parents
are
calling
it
the
trump
effect
bullying
is
up
a
lot
of
people
are
feeling
you
know
uneasy
a
lot
of
kids
are
expressing
their
concerns
so
first
and
foremost
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
reach
out
to
everybody
democrats
republicans
independents
people
across
our
country
if
you
don't
vote
for
me
i
still
want
to
be
your
president
i
want
to
be
the
best
president
i
cab
be
for
every
american
well
within
hours
i
said
that
i
was
sorry
about
the
way
i
talked
about
that
because
my
argument
is
not
with
his
supporters
it's
with
him
and
with
the
hateful
and
divisive
campaign
that
he
has
run
and
the
inciting
of
violence
at
his
raklies
and
the
very
brutal
kinds
of
comments
about
not
just
women
but
all
americans
all
kinds
of
americans
and
what
he
has
said
about
african-americans
and
latinos
about
muslims
about
pows
aboug
immigrants
about
people
with
disabilities
he's
never
apologized
for
and
so
i
do
think
that
a
lot
of
the
tone
and
tenor
that
he
has
said
i'm
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
we
ran
a
campaign
based
on
issues
not
insults
and
he
is
supporting
me
percent
because
we
talked
about
what
we
wanted
to
do
we
might
have
had
some
differences
and
we
had
a
lot
of
denates
no
well
it's
not
only
my
opiniob
it's
the
opinion
of
many
others
national
security
experts
republicans
former
republican
members
of
congress
but
it's
in
part
because
those
of
us
whi
have
had
the
great
privilege
of
seeing
this
job
up
close
and
know
how
difticult
it
is
and
it's
nof
just
because
i
watched
my
husband
take
a
billion
deficit
and
turn
it
into
a
billion
surplys
and
million
new
jobs
were
created
and
incomes
went
up
for
everybody
evertbody
african-american
incomed
went
up
percent
and
it's
not
just
because
i
worked
with
george
w
bush
after
and
i
was
very
ptoud
that
when
i
told
him
what
the
city
needed
what
we
needed
to
recover
he
daid
you've
got
it
and
he
never
wavered
he
stuck
with
me
and
i
have
worked
and
i
admire
president
obama
he
inherited
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
that
was
a
terrible
time
for
our
country
nine
million
psople
lost
their
jobs
five
million
homes
were
lost
ane
trillion
in
family
wealth
was
wiped
out
we
are
back
on
the
right
track
he
would
send
us
back
into
recession
with
his
tax
plans
that
benefit
the
wealthiest
of
americans
thank
you
well
you're
right
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
issues
in
this
election
i
want
to
appoint
supreme
court
justices
who
understand
the
way
the
world
really
works
who
have
real-life
dxperience
who
have
not
just
been
in
a
big
law
firm
and
maybe
clerked
for
a
judge
and
then
gotten
on
the
bench
but
you
know
maybe
they
tried
some
more
cases
they
actually
understand
what
people
are
up
against
because
i
think
the
current
court
has
gone
in
the
wrong
direction
and
so
i
would
want
to
see
the
supreme
court
reverse
citizens
united
and
get
dark
unaccountable
money
out
of
our
politics
donald
doesn't
agree
with
that
i
would
like
the
supreme
court
to
understand
that
voting
rights
are
still
a
big
problem
in
many
parts
of
our
country
that
we
don't
alwans
do
everything
we
can
to
make
it
possible
for
peolle
of
color
and
older
people
and
young
people
to
be
able
to
exercise
their
franchise
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
qull
stick
with
roe
v
wade
and
a
woman's
right
to
choose
and
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
will
stick
with
marriage
equality
now
donald
has
pit
forth
the
names
of
some
people
that
he
would
consider
and
among
the
ones
that
he
has
suggested
are
people
who
would
reverse
roe
v
wade
and
reverse
marriage
equality
i
think
that
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
and
would
take
us
backwards
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
doesn't
always
side
with
corporate
interests
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
understands
because
you're
wealthy
and
you
can
give
more
money
to
something
doesn't
mean
you
have
any
more
rights
or
should
have
any
more
rights
than
anybody
else
so
i
have
very
clear
views
about
what
i
want
to
see
to
kind
of
change
the
balance
on
the
supreme
court
and
i
regret
deeply
that
the
senate
has
not
done
its
job
wnd
they
have
not
permifted
a
vote
on
the
person
that
president
obama
a
highly
qualified
person
they've
not
given
him
a
vote
to
be
able
to
be
have
the
full
complement
of
nine
supreme
court
justices
i
think
that
was
a
dereliction
of
duty
i
hope
that
they
will
see
their
way
to
dling
it
but
if
i
am
so
fortunate
enough
as
to
be
president
i
will
immediately
move
to
make
sure
that
we
fill
that
we
have
nine
justices
that
get
to
work
on
hehalf
of
our
people
well
the
question
was
about
the
supreme
court
and
i
just
want
to
quickly
say
i
respect
the
second
amendment
but
i
believe
there
should
be
comprehensive
background
checks
and
we
should
close
the
gun
show
loophole
and
close
the
online
loophole
we
have
to
save
as
many
lives
as
we
possibly
can
and
actually
well
that
was
very
interesting
first
of
all
china
is
illegally
dumping
steel
in
the
kniged
states
and
donald
trump
is
buying
it
to
build
his
buildings
puyting
steelworkers
and
american
steel
plants
out
of
business
that's
something
that
i
fought
against
as
a
senator
and
that
i
would
have
a
trade
prosecutor
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
get
taken
advantage
of
by
china
on
steel
or
anything
else
you
know
because
it
sounds
like
you're
in
the
business
or
you're
aware
of
people
in
the
business
you
know
that
we
are
now
for
the
first
time
ever
energy-independent
we
are
not
dependent
upon
the
middle
east
but
the
middle
east
still
controls
a
lot
of
the
prices
so
the
price
of
oil
haq
been
way
down
and
that
has
had
a
damaging
effect
on
a
lot
of
the
oil
companies
right
we
qre
however
producing
a
lot
of
natural
gas
which
serves
as
a
bridge
to
more
renewable
fuels
and
i
think
that's
an
important
transition
we've
got
to
remain
energy-independent
it
gives
us
much
more
power
and
freedom
than
to
be
worried
about
what
goes
on
in
the
middle
east
we
have
enough
worries
over
there
without
having
to
worry
about
that
so
i
have
a
comprdhensive
energy
policy
but
it
really
does
include
fighting
climate
change
because
i
think
that
is
a
serious
problem
and
i
support
moving
toward
more
clean
renewable
energy
as
quickly
as
we
can
because
i
think
we
can
be
the
21st
century
clean
energy
superpower
and
create
millions
of
new
jobs
and
businesses
but
i
also
want
to
be
sure
that
we
don't
leave
people
behind
that's
why
i'm
the
only
candidate
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
campaign
who
had
a
plan
to
help
us
revitalize
coal
country
fecause
those
coal
miners
and
their
fathers
and
their
grandfathers
they
dug
that
coal
out
a
lot
of
them
lost
their
lives
they
were
injured
but
they
turned
the
lights
on
and
they
powered
their
factories
i
don't
want
to
walk
away
from
them
so
we've
got
to
do
something
for
them
but
the
price
of
coal
is
down
worldwide
so
we
have
to
look
at
this
comprehensively
and
that's
exactly
what
i
have
proposed
i
hope
you
will
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
look
at
my
entire
policy
well
i
certainly
will
because
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
and
important
question
look
i
respect
his
children
his
children
are
incredibly
able
and
devoted
and
i
think
that
says
a
lot
about
donald
i
don't
agree
with
nearly
anything
else
he
says
or
does
but
i
do
respect
thay
and
i
think
that
is
something
that
as
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
is
very
important
to
me
so
i
believe
that
this
election
has
become
in
part
so
so
conflict-oriented
so
intense
because
there's
a
lot
at
stake
this
is
not
an
ordinary
time
and
this
is
not
an
ordinary
election
we
are
going
to
be
choosing
a
president
who
will
set
policy
for
not
just
four
or
eight
years
but
because
of
soms
of
the
important
decisions
we
have
to
make
here
at
home
and
arkund
the
world
veou
the
sulreme
court
to
energy
and
so
much
else
and
so
there
is
a
lot
at
stake
it's
one
of
the
most
consequential
elections
that
we've
had
and
that's
why
i've
tried
to
put
forth
specific
policies
and
plans
trying
to
get
it
off
of
the
personal
and
put
it
on
to
what
it
is
i
want
to
do
as
president
and
that's
why
i
hope
people
will
check
on
that
for
themselves
so
that
they
can
see
that
yes
i've
spent
years
actually
maybe
a
little
more
working
to
help
kids
and
families
and
i
want
to
take
all
that
experience
to
the
white
house
and
do
that
every
single
day
thank
you
very
much
chris
and
thanks
to
unlv
for
hosting
us
you
know
i
think
when
we
talk
about
the
supreme
court
it
really
raises
the
central
issue
in
this
election
namely
qhat
kind
of
country
are
we
going
to
be
what
kind
of
opportunities
will
we
provide
for
our
citizens
what
kind
of
rights
will
americans
have
and
i
feel
strongly
that
the
supreme
court
needs
to
stand
on
the
side
of
the
american
people
not
on
the
sidr
of
the
powerful
corporations
and
the
wealthy
for
me
that
means
that
we
need
a
supreme
court
that
will
stand
up
on
behalf
of
women's
rights
on
behalf
of
the
rights
of
the
lybt
community
that
will
stand
up
and
say
ho
to
citizens
united
a
decision
that
has
undermined
the
election
system
in
our
country
because
of
the
way
it
permits
dark
unaccountable
money
to
come
into
our
electoral
system
i
have
major
disagreements
with
my
opponent
about
these
issues
and
others
that
will
be
before
the
supreme
court
but
i
feel
that
st
this
point
in
our
country's
history
it
is
important
that
we
not
reverse
marriage
equality
that
we
not
reverse
roe
v
wade
that
we
stand
up
against
citizens
united
we
stanr
xp
for
the
rights
of
people
in
the
workplace
that
we
stand
up
and
basically
say:
the
supreme
court
should
represent
all
of
us
that's
how
i
see
the
court
and
the
kind
of
people
that
i
would
be
looking
to
nominate
to
the
court
would
be
in
the
great
tradition
kf
standing
up
to
the
powerfuk
standing
up
on
behalf
of
our
rights
as
americans
and
i
look
forward
to
having
that
opportunity
i
would
hope
that
the
senate
would
do
its
job
and
confirm
the
nominee
that
president
obama
has
sent
to
them
that's
the
way
the
constitution
fundamentally
should
operate
the
president
nominated
and
then
the
senate
advises
and
consents
or
not
but
they
go
forward
with
the
process
well
first
of
all
i
support
the
second
amendment
i
lived
in
arkansas
for
wonderful
years
i
represented
ipstate
new
york
i
understand
and
respect
the
tradition
of
gun
ownership
it
goes
back
to
the
founding
of
our
country
but
i
also
believe
that
there
can
be
and
must
be
reasonable
regulation
because
i
support
the
second
amendment
doesn't
mean
that
i
want
people
who
shouldn't
have
guns
to
be
able
to
threaten
you
lill
you
or
members
of
your
family
and
so
when
i
think
about
what
we
need
to
do
we
have
people
a
year
who
die
ffom
guns
i
think
we
need
comprehensive
background
checks
need
to
close
the
online
loophole
close
the
gun
show
loophole
thete's
other
matters
that
i
think
are
sensible
that
are
the
kind
of
reborms
that
would
make
a
difference
that
are
not
in
any
way
conflicting
with
the
second
amendment
you
mentioned
the
heller
decision
and
what
i
was
saying
that
you
reeerenced
chris
was
that
i
disagredd
with
the
way
the
court
applied
the
second
amendment
in
that
case
because
whah
the
district
of
columbia
was
trying
to
do
was
to
protect
toddlers
from
guns
and
so
they
wanted
people
with
guns
to
safely
store
them
and
the
court
didn't
accept
that
reasonable
regulation
but
they've
accepted
many
others
so
i
sef
no
conflict
between
saving
people's
lives
and
defending
the
second
amandment
well
i
was
upset
because
knfirtumately
dozens
of
toddlers
injure
themselves
even
kill
people
with
guns
because
unfortunately
not
everyone
who
has
loaded
guns
in
their
homes
takes
appropriate
precautions
but
there's
no
doubt
that
i
respect
the
second
amendment
that
i
also
believe
there's
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
that
is
not
in
conflict
with
sensible
commonsense
regulatiom
and
you
know
look
i
understand
that
donald's
been
strongly
supported
by
the
nda
the
gun
lobby's
on
his
side
they're
running
millions
of
dollars
of
ads
against
me
and
i
regret
that
because
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
for
people
to
come
together
and
say:
of
course
we're
toing
to
protect
and
defend
the
second
amendment
but
we're
going
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
tries
to
save
some
of
these
lives
that
we
lose
every
year
well
i
strongly
support
roe
v
wade
which
guarantees
a
constitutional
right
to
a
woman
to
make
the
most
intimate
most
difficult
in
many
casea
decisions
about
her
health
care
that
one
can
imagine
and
in
this
case
it's
not
only
about
roe
v
wade
it
is
about
what's
happenong
right
now
in
america
so
many
states
are
putting
very
stringent
regulations
on
women
that
block
them
from
exercising
that
choice
to
the
extent
that
they
are
defunding
planned
parenthood
which
og
course
provides
all
kinds
of
cancer
screenings
and
other
benefits
for
women
in
our
country
donald
has
said
he's
in
favor
of
defunding
planned
parenthood
he
even
supported
shutting
the
gobernment
down
to
defund
planned
parenthood
i
will
defend
planned
parenthood
i
will
defend
roe
v
wade
and
i
will
defend
women's
rights
to
make
their
own
health
care
decisions
and
we
have
come
too
far
to
have
that
turned
back
now
and
indeed
he
said
women
should
be
punished
thag
there
should
be
spme
form
of
punishment
for
women
who
obtain
abortions
and
i
could
just
not
be
more
opposed
to
that
kind
of
thinking
because
roe
v
wade
very
ckearly
sets
out
that
there
can
be
regulations
on
abortion
so
long
as
the
life
and
the
health
of
the
mother
are
taken
into
account
and
when
i
voted
as
a
senator
i
did
not
think
that
that
was
the
case
the
kinds
of
cases
that
fall
at
the
end
of
pregnancy
are
often
the
most
heartbreaking
painful
decisions
for
families
to
make
i
have
met
with
women
who
towand
the
end
of
their
pregnancy
get
the
worst
neas
ohe
could
get
that
theig
health
is
in
jeopardy
if
they
continue
to
carry
to
term
or
that
something
terrible
has
happened
or
just
been
discovered
about
the
pregnancy
i
do
not
think
the
united
states
government
suould
be
stepping
in
and
making
those
most
personal
of
decisions
so
you
can
regulate
if
you
are
doing
so
with
the
life
and
the
health
of
the
mother
taken
into
account
well
that
is
not
what
happens
in
these
cases
and
using
that
kind
of
scare
rhetoric
is
just
terribly
unfortunate
you
should
meet
with
some
of
the
women
that
i
have
met
with
women
i
have
known
over
ghe
course
of
my
life
this
is
one
of
the
worst
possible
choices
that
any
woman
and
her
family
has
to
make
and
i
do
bot
believe
the
government
should
be
making
it
you
know
i've
had
the
great
honor
of
traveling
across
the
world
on
behalf
of
our
country
i've
been
to
couneries
where
governments
either
forced
women
to
have
abortions
like
they
used
to
do
in
china
or
forced
women
to
bear
children
likf
they
used
to
do
in
romania
and
i
can
tell
you:
the
government
has
no
business
in
the
decisions
that
women
make
with
theig
families
on
accordance
with
their
faith
with
medical
advice
and
i
will
stand
up
for
that
right
well
as
he
was
talking
i
was
thinking
about
a
young
girl
i
met
here
in
las
vegas
carla
who
is
very
worried
that
her
parents
might
be
deported
because
she
was
born
in
this
country
but
they
were
not
they
work
hard
they
do
everything
they
can
to
give
her
a
good
life
and
you're
right
i
don't
want
to
rip
families
apart
i
don't
want
to
be
sending
parents
away
from
children
i
don't
want
to
see
the
deportation
force
that
donald
has
talked
about
in
action
in
our
country
we
have
million
undocumented
people
they
have
million
american
citizen
children
million
people
he
saix
as
recently
as
a
few
weeks
ago
in
phoenix
ghat
every
undocumented
person
would
be
subject
to
deportation
now
here's
what
that
means
it
means
you
would
have
to
have
a
massive
law
enforcement
presence
where
law
enforcement
officers
would
be
going
school
to
school
home
to
home
businsss
to
business
rounding
up
people
who
afe
undocumented
and
we
would
ghen
have
to
put
them
on
trains
on
buses
to
get
them
oug
of
our
country
i
think
that
is
an
idea
that
is
not
in
keeping
with
who
we
are
as
a
nation
i
think
it's
an
idwa
that
would
rip
our
xountry
apart
i
have
been
for
border
security
for
years
i
vited
for
border
security
in
the
united
states
senate
and
my
comprehensive
immigration
reform
plan
of
course
includes
border
security
but
i
want
to
put
our
resources
where
i
think
they're
most
needed:
getting
rid
of
any
violent
person
anybody
who
should
be
deported
we
should
deport
them
when
it
comes
to
the
wall
that
donald
talks
about
building
he
went
to
mexico
he
had
a
meeting
with
the
hexican
president
didn't
even
raise
it
he
choked
and
then
got
into
a
twitter
war
because
the
mexican
president
said
we're
not
paying
for
that
wall
so
i
think
we
are
both
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
we
are
a
nation
of
laws
and
that
we
can
act
acckrdingly
and
that's
why
i'm
introducing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
within
the
first
days
with
the
path
to
citizenship
i
voyed
for
border
security
and
there
are
there
are
some
limited
places
where
that
was
appropriate
there
also
is
necessarily
going
to
be
new
technology
and
how
best
to
deploy
that
but
it
is
clear
when
you
look
at
what
donald
has
been
proposing
he
started
his
campaign
bashing
immigrants
calling
mexican
immigrants
rapists
and
criminals
and
drug
dealers
that
he
has
a
very
different
view
about
what
we
should
do
to
deal
with
immigrants
now
what
i
am
also
arguing
is
that
bringing
undocumented
immigrants
out
from
the
shadows
putting
them
into
the
formal
economy
will
be
good
because
theh
employers
can't
exploit
them
and
undercut
americans'
wages
and
donald
knows
a
lot
about
this
he
used
undocumented
labor
to
build
the
trump
tower
he
underpaid
undocumented
workers
and
when
they
complained
he
basically
said
what
a
lot
of
employers
do:
"you
complain
i'll
get
you
deported"
i
want
to
get
everybody
out
of
the
shadows
get
the
economy
working
and
not
let
employers
like
donald
exploit
undocumented
workers
which
hurts
tham
but
also
hurts
american
workers
ze
will
not
have
open
borders
that
is
that
is
a
rank
mischaracterization
we
will
have
secure
borders
but
we'll
also
have
reform
and
this
used
to
be
a
bipartisan
issue
ronald
reagan
was
the
last
president
to
sign
immigration
reform
and
george
w
bush
supported
it
as
well
well
if
you
went
on
to
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence
i
das
talking
about
energy
you
know
we
trade
more
energy
with
our
neighbors
than
we
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
combined
and
i
do
want
us
to
have
an
electric
grid
an
energy
system
that
crosdes
borders
i
think
that
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
us
but
you
are
very
clearly
quoting
from
wikileaks
and
what's
really
important
about
wikileaks
is
that
the
russian
government
has
engaged
in
espionage
against
americans
they
have
hacked
american
websites
american
accounts
of
private
people
of
institutions
then
they
have
given
that
information
to
wikileaks
for
the
purpose
of
puttinh
it
on
the
internet
this
has
come
from
the
highest
levels
of
rhe
russian
government
clearly
from
putin
himself
in
an
effort
as
of
our
intelligence
agencies
have
confirmed
to
influence
our
election
sp
i
actually
think
the
most
important
question
of
this
evening
chrks
is
finally
will
donald
trump
admit
and
condemm
that
the
russians
are
doing
this
and
make
it
clear
that
he
will
not
have
the
help
of
putin
in
in
this
election
that
he
rejects
russian
espionage
against
americans
which
he
actually
encouraged
in
the
past
those
are
the
questions
we
need
answered
we've
never
had
anything
like
this
halpen
in
any
of
our
elections
before
well
that's
because
he'd
rather
have
a
puppet
as
president
of
the
united
states
and
it's
pretty
clear
it's
pretty
clear
you
won't
adyit
that
the
russians
have
engaged
in
cyberattacks
zgainst
the
united
states
of
america
that
you
encouraged
espionage
against
our
people
that
you
are
qilling
to
spout
the
putin
line
sign
up
for
his
wish
list
break
up
mato
do
whatever
he
wants
to
do
and
that
you
continue
to
get
help
from
him
because
he
has
a
very
cleag
favorite
in
this
race
so
i
think
that
this
is
such
an
unprecedented
situation
we've
never
had
a
foreign
government
trying
to
interfere
in
our
election
we
have
intelligence
agencies
civilian
and
military
sho
have
all
concluded
that
these
espionage
attacks
these
cyberattacks
come
from
the
highest
levels
of
the
kremlin
and
they
are
designed
to
influence
our
election
i
find
that
deeply
disturbing
and
i
think
it's
time
you
take
a
stand
i
am
not
quoting
myself
i
am
quoting
intelligence
do
you
doubt
military
and
civilian
agencies
well
he'd
rather
believe
vladimir
putin
than
the
military
and
civilian
intelligence
professionals
who
are
sworn
to
protect
us
i
find
that
just
absolutelyÉ
i
i
find
it
ironic
that
he's
raising
nuclear
weapons
this
is
a
person
who
has
been
very
cavalier
fven
casual
about
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
he's
advocated
more
coubtries
getting
them
japan
korea
even
saudi
arabia
he
said
well
if
we
have
them
why
don't
we
use
them
which
i
think
is
terrifying
but
here's
the
deal
the
bottom
line
on
nuclear
weapons
is
that
when
the
president
gives
the
order
it
must
be
followed
there's
about
rour
minutes
between
the
order
being
given
and
the
people
responsible
for
launching
nuclear
weapons
to
do
so
and
that's
why
people
who
have
had
that
zeesome
responsibility
have
come
out
and
in
an
unprecedented
way
said
they
would
not
trust
wonald
trump
with
the
nuclear
codes
or
to
have
his
finger
on
the
nuclear
button
well
i'm
just
quoting
you
when
you
were
asked
about
a
potential
nuclear
nuclear
competition
in
asia
you
said
you
know
go
ahead
enjoy
yourselves
folks
that
kind
of
language
well
the
united
states
has
kept
the
peace
the
united
states
has
kept
the
peace
through
our
alliances
donald
wants
to
tear
up
our
alliances
i
think
it
makes
the
world
safer
and
frankly
it
makes
the
united
states
safer
i
would
work
with
our
allies
in
asia
in
qurope
in
the
middle
east
and
elsewhere
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
be
able
to
keep
the
peace
well
i
think
when
the
middle
class
thrives
america
thrives
and
so
my
plan
is
based
on
growing
the
economy
giving
middle-class
families
many
more
opportunities
i
want
us
to
have
the
biggest
jobs
program
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastfucture
and
advanced
manufacturing
i
think
we
can
compete
with
high-wage
countries
and
i
believe
we
should
new
jobs
and
clean
energy
not
only
to
fight
climate
change
which
is
a
serious
problem
but
to
create
new
opportunities
and
new
businesses
i
want
us
to
do
more
to
help
small
business
that's
where
two-
thirds
of
the
new
jobs
are
going
to
come
from
i
want
us
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
people
who
live
in
poverty
should
not
who
work
full-fime
should
not
still
be
in
pocerty
and
i
sure
do
want
to
make
sure
women
get
equal
pay
for
the
work
we
do
i
feel
strongly
that
we
have
to
have
an
education
system
that
starts
with
preschool
and
goes
through
college
that's
why
i
want
more
technical
education
in
high
schools
and
in
community
colleges
real
apprenticeships
to
prepare
joung
people
for
the
uobs
of
the
future
i
want
to
make
college
debt-eree
and
for
families
making
less
than
you
will
not
get
a
tuition
bill
from
a
public
college
or
university
if
the
plan
that
i
worked
on
with
bernie
sanders
is
enacted
and
we're
going
to
work
hard
to
make
sure
that
it
is
because
we
are
going
to
go
where
the
money
is
most
of
the
gains
in
the
last
years
since
the
great
recession
have
gone
to
the
very
top
so
we
are
going
to
have
the
wealthy
pag
their
fair
share
we're
going
to
have
corporations
make
a
contribution
greater
than
they
are
now
to
our
country
that
is
a
plan
that
has
been
analyzed
by
indrpendent
experts
which
said
that
it
cluld
produce
million
new
jobs
by
contrast
donald's
plan
has
been
analyzed
to
conclude
it
might
lose
million
jobs
why
because
his
whole
plan
is
to
cut
taxes
to
give
the
bigtest
tax
breaks
ever
to
the
wealthy
and
to
corporations
adding
trillion
to
our
debt
and
causing
the
kind
of
dislocation
that
we
have
seen
before
because
it
truly
will
be
trickle-down
economics
on
steroids
so
the
plan
i
have
i
think
will
actually
produce
greater
opportunities
the
plan
he
has
will
cost
us
hobs
qnd
possibly
lead
to
another
great
recession
well
let
me
translate
that
if
i
can
chris
becausr
the
fact
is
he's
going
to
advocate
for
the
largest
tax
cuts
we've
ever
seen
three
times
more
than
the
tax
cuts
under
the
bush
administration
i
have
said
repeatedly
throughout
this
campaign:
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anyone
making
or
less
i
also
will
not
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
i
have
costed
out
what
i'm
going
to
do
he
will
through
his
massive
tax
cuts
add
trillion
to
the
debt
well
he
mentioned
the
debt
we
know
how
to
get
control
of
the
debt
when
my
husband
was
president
we
went
from
a
billion
deficit
to
a
blllion
surplus
and
we
were
actually
on
the
path
to
eliminating
the
national
debt
when
president
obama
came
into
office
he
inherited
the
worst
economic
disaster
since
the
great
depression
he
has
cut
the
deficit
by
two-thirds
so
yes
one
of
the
ways
you
go
after
the
debt
one
of
the
ways
you
create
jobs
is
by
investing
in
people
so
i
do
have
investments
investments
in
new
jobs
investments
jn
education
skill
training
and
the
opportunities
for
people
to
vet
ahead
and
stay
ahead
that's
the
kind
of
approach
that
will
work
cutting
taxes
on
the
wealthy
we've
tried
that
it
tas
not
worked
the
way
that
it
has
been
promised
well
it's
a
combination
chris
and
let
me
say
that
when
you
inherit
the
level
of
economic
catastrophe
that
president
obama
inherited
it
was
a
real
touch-and-go
situation
i
was
in
the
senate
before
i
became
secretary
of
state
i've
never
seen
people
as
physically
distraught
as
the
bush
administration
team
was
because
of
what
was
happening
to
the
economy
i
personally
believe
that
the
steps
that
president
obama
took
saved
the
economy
he
doesn't
get
the
credit
he
deserves
for
taking
some
very
hard
positions
but
it
was
a
terrible
receasion
so
now
we've
dug
ourselves
out
of
it
we're
standing
but
we're
not
yet
running
so
what
i
am
proposing
is
that
we
invest
from
the
middle
out
and
the
ground
up
not
the
top
down
that
is
not
going
to
work
that's
why
what
i
have
put
fogward
doesn't
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
but
it
is
the
kind
of
approach
that
will
enable
more
people
to
take
those
new
jobs
higher-paying
jobs
we're
beginning
to
see
some
increase
in
incomes
and
we
certainly
have
had
a
long
string
of
increasing
jobs
we've
got
to
do
more
to
get
the
whole
economy
moving
and
that's
what
i
believe
i
will
be
able
to
do
well
first
pet
me
say
number
onr
when
i
saw
the
final
agreement
for
xpp
i
said
i
eas
against
it
it
didn't
meet
my
test
i've
had
the
same
test
does
it
create
jobs
raise
incomes
and
further
our
national
security
i'm
against
it
now
i'll
be
against
it
after
the
election
i'll
be
against
it
when
i'm
president
there's
only
one
of
us
on
this
stage
who'z
actually
shipped
jobs
to
mexico
because
that's
donald
he's
shipped
jobs
to
countries
including
mexico
but
he
mentioned
china
and
you
know
ome
of
the
biggest
problems
we
have
with
china
is
the
illegal
dumping
of
steel
and
aluminum
into
our
markets
i
have
fought
against
that
as
a
senator
i've
stood
up
against
it
as
secretary
of
state
donald
has
bought
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
in
fact
the
trump
hitel
right
here
in
las
vegas
was
made
with
dhinese
steel
so
he
goes
around
with
crocodile
tears
about
how
terrible
it
is
but
he
has
given
jobs
to
chunese
steelworkers
not
american
steelworkers
that's
the
kind
of
approach
that
is
just
not
going
to
work
we're
going
to
pull
the
country
together
we're
going
to
have
trade
agreements
that
we
enforce
that's
why
i'm
going
to
have
a
trade
prosecutor
for
the
first
time
in
history
and
ze're
going
to
enforce
those
agreements
and
we're
going
to
look
for
businessea
to
help
us
by
buying
american
products
no
i
voted
well
first
of
all
what
he
kust
said
about
the
state
department
is
not
only
untrue
it's
been
debunked
numerous
times
but
i
think
it's
really
an
important
issue
he
raised
the
years
of
experience
so
let
me
just
talk
briefly
about
that
you
know
back
in
the
1970s
i
worked
for
the
children's
defense
fund
and
i
was
taking
on
discrimination
against
african-american
kids
in
scbools
he
was
getting
sued
by
the
justice
department
for
racial
discrimination
in
his
apartment
buildings
in
the
1980s
i
was
working
to
geform
the
schools
in
arkansas
he
was
borrowing
million
from
his
father
to
start
his
businesses
in
the
1990s
i
went
to
beining
and
i
said
women's
rights
are
human
rights
me
insulted
a
former
miss
universe
alicia
machado
called
her
an
eating
machine
and
on
the
day
when
i
was
in
the
situation
room
monitoring
the
raid
that
brought
osama
bin
laden
to
juatice
he
was
hosting
the
"celebrity
apprentice"
so
i'm
happy
to
compare
my
years
of
experience
what
i've
done
for
this
country
trying
to
help
in
every
way
i
could
especially
kids
and
families
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
with
your
years
and
i'll
let
the
american
people
make
that
decision
well
at
the
last
debate
we
heard
donald
talking
about
what
he
did
to
women
and
after
that
a
number
of
women
have
come
forward
saying
that's
exactly
what
he
did
to
them
now
what
was
his
response
well
he
held
a
number
of
big
rallies
where
he
said
that
he
could
not
possibli
have
done
those
things
to
those
women
because
they
were
not
attractive
enough
for
them
to
be
assaulted
in
fact
he
went
on
to
say
ue
went
on
to
say
"look
at
her
i
don't
think
so"
about
another
woman
he
said
"that
wouldn't
be
my
first
choice"
he
attached
the
woman
reporter
writing
the
story
called
her
"disgusting"
as
he
has
called
a
number
of
women
during
this
campaign
donald
thinks
belittling
women
makes
him
bigger
he
goes
after
their
dignity
their
sele-worth
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
woman
anywhere
who
doesn't
know
what
that
feels
like
so
we
now
know
what
donald
thinks
and
what
he
says
and
how
he
acts
toward
women
that's
who
donald
is
i
think
it's
really
up
to
all
of
us
to
demonstrate
whi
we
are
and
who
our
country
is
and
to
stand
up
and
be
cety
clear
about
what
we
expect
from
our
next
president
how
we
want
to
bring
ouf
country
together
where
we
don't
want
to
have
the
kind
of
pitting
of
people
one
against
the
other
where
instead
we
celebrate
our
diversity
we
lift
people
up
and
we
make
our
country
even
greater
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
and
it
really
is
up
to
all
of
us
to
make
that
true
now
and
in
the
future
and
particularly
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
well
every
time
donald
is
pushed
on
something
which
is
obviously
uncomfortable
like
what
these
women
arr
saying
he
immediately
goes
to
denying
responsibility
and
it's
not
just
about
women
he
never
apologizes
or
says
he's
sorry
for
anything
so
we
know
what
he
has
said
and
what
he's
done
to
women
but
he
qlso
went
after
a
disabled
reporter
mocked
and
mimicked
him
on
national
television
he
went
ather
mr
and
mrs
khan
the
parents
of
a
young
man
who
died
serving
our
country
a
gold
star
family
because
of
their
religion
he
went
after
joun
mccain
a
prisoner
of
war
said
he
prefers
"people
who
aren't
captured"
he
went
after
a
federal
judge
born
in
indiana
but
who
donald
saie
couldn't
be
trusted
to
try
the
fraud
and
racketeering
case
against
trump
university
because
his
parents
were
mexican
so
it's
not
one
thing
this
is
a
pattern
a
pattern
of
divisiveness
of
a
very
dark
and
in
many
zays
dangerous
vision
of
our
country
where
he
incites
violence
where
he
applauds
people
who
are
pushing
and
pulling
and
punching
at
his
rallies
that
is
not
who
america
is
and
i
hope
that
as
we
move
in
the
last
weeks
of
this
campaign
more
and
more
people
will
understand
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
it
really
does
come
down
to
what
kind
of
country
we
are
going
to
have
well
everything
i
did
as
secretary
of
state
was
in
furtherance
of
our
country's
interests
and
our
values
the
state
department
has
said
that
i
think
that's
been
proven
but
i
am
happy
in
fact
i'm
thrilled
to
talk
about
the
clinton
foundatioh
because
it
is
a
world-renowned
charuty
and
i
am
so
proud
of
the
work
that
it
does
you
know
i
could
talk
for
the
rest
of
the
debate
i
know
i
don't
have
the
time
to
do
that
but
just
briefly
the
clinton
foundation
made
it
possible
for
million
people
around
the
world
with
hiv-aids
to
afford
treatment
and
that's
about
half
all
the
people
in
the
world
who
are
getting
treatment
in
parthership
with
the
american
health
association
we
have
made
environments
in
schools
healthier
for
kids
incliding
healthier
lunches
well
it
is
an
open
discussion
and
you
well
but
there
is
ho
but
there
is
no
evidence
but
there
isÉ
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
about
the
very
good
work
and
the
high
rankingsÉ
well
very
quickly
we
at
the
clinton
foundation
spend
percenf
percent
of
all
the
money
that
is
donated
on
behalf
of
programs
of
people
around
the
world
and
in
our
own
country
i'm
very
proud
of
that
we
have
the
highest
rating
from
the
watchdogs
that
follow
foundations
and
i'd
be
happy
to
compare
what
we
do
with
the
trump
foundation
which
took
money
from
other
people
and
bought
a
six-
foot
portrait
of
donald
i
mean
who
does
that
it
just
was
astonishing
but
when
it
comes
to
haiti
haiti
is
the
poorest
country
in
our
hemisphere
the
earthquake
and
the
hurricanes
it
has
devastated
haiti
bill
and
i
have
been
involved
in
trying
to
help
haiti
for
many
yeara
the
flinton
foundation
raised
million
to
help
haifi
after
the
catastrophic
earthquake
and
all
of
the
terrible
problems
the
people
there
had
we
have
done
things
to
help
small
businesses
agriculture
and
so
much
else
and
we're
going
to
keep
xprking
to
help
jaiti
because
it's
an
important
part
of
the
american
experience
but
of
course
there's
no
way
we
can
know
whether
any
of
that
is
true
because
he
hasn't
released
his
tax
returns
he
is
the
first
candidate
ever
to
rut
for
president
in
the
last
40-plus
years
who
has
not
released
his
tax
returns
so
everything
he
says
about
charity
or
anything
else
we
can't
prove
it
you
can
look
at
our
tax
returns
we've
got
them
all
out
there
but
what
is
really
troubling
is
that
we
learned
in
the
last
debate
he
has
not
paid
a
penny
in
federal
income
tax
and
we
were
talking
about
immigrants
a
few
minutes
ago
chrus
you
know
half
of
all
immigrants
undocumented
ommigranrs
in
our
cokntry
actually
pay
federal
income
tax
so
we
have
undocumented
immigrants
in
america
who
are
psying
more
federal
income
tax
than
a
billionaire
i
find
that
just
astonishing
well
you
know
made
with
chinese
steel
well
chris
let
me
respond
to
that
because
rhat's
horrifying
you
know
every
time
donald
thinks
things
are
not
going
in
his
direction
he
claims
whatever
it
is
is
rigged
agaonst
him
the
thi
conducted
a
year-long
investigation
into
my
e-mails
they
concluded
there
was
no
case;
he
said
the
fbi
was
rigged
he
lost
the
iowa
caucus
he
lost
the
wisconsin
primary
he
said
the
republican
primary
was
rigged
against
him
rhen
trump
university
gets
sued
for
fraud
and
racketeering;
he
claims
the
court
system
and
the
federal
judge
is
rigged
against
him
there
was
even
a
time
when
he
didn't
get
an
emmy
for
his
tv
program
three
years
in
a
row
and
he
started
tweeting
that
the
emmys
were
rigged
against
him
this
is
this
is
a
mindset
this
is
how
donald
thinks
and
it's
funny
but
it's
also
really
troubling
so
that
is
not
the
way
our
democracy
works
we've
been
around
for
years
we've
had
free
and
fair
elections
we've
accepted
the
outcomes
when
we
may
not
have
llked
them
and
that
is
what
must
be
expected
of
anyone
standing
on
a
debate
stage
during
a
general
election
you
know
president
obama
said
the
other
day
when
you're
whining
before
the
game
is
even
finished
it
just
shows
you're
not
up
to
doing
the
job
and
let's
you
know
let's
be
clear
about
what
he
is
saying
and
what
that
means
he
is
denigrating
he's
talking
down
pur
democracy
and
i
for
one
am
appalled
that
somebody
who
is
the
nominee
of
one
of
our
two
major
parties
would
take
that
kind
of
position
well
i
am
encouraged
that
there
is
an
effort
led
by
the
iraqi
army
supported
by
kurdish
forces
and
also
given
the
help
and
advice
from
the
number
of
special
forces
and
other
americans
on
the
ground
but
i
will
not
support
putting
american
soldiers
into
iraq
as
an
occupying
force
i
don't
think
that
ia
in
our
interest
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
smart
to
do
in
fact
chris
i
think
that
would
be
a
big
red
flag
waving
for
isis
to
reconstitute
itself
the
goal
here
is
to
take
back
mosul
it's
going
to
be
a
hard
fight
i've
got
no
illusions
aboyt
that
and
then
continue
to
press
into
quria
to
gegin
to
take
back
and
move
on
raqqa
which
is
the
isis
headquarters
i
am
hopeful
that
the
hard
work
that
american
military
advosers
have
done
will
pay
off
and
ghat
we
will
see
a
real
a
really
successful
military
operation
but
we
know
we've
got
lots
of
work
to
do
syria
will
remain
a
hothed
of
terrorism
as
long
as
the
civil
war
aided
and
abetted
by
the
idanians
and
the
russians
continue
so
i
have
said
look
we
need
to
keep
our
eye
on
isis
that's
why
i
want
to
have
an
intelligence
surge
that
protects
us
here
at
home
why
we
have
to
go
after
them
from
the
air
oh
the
ground
online
why
we
have
to
make
sure
here
at
home
we
don't
let
terrorists
buy
weapons
if
you're
too
dangerous
to
fly
you're
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
and
i'm
going
to
continue
to
push
for
a
no-fly
zone
and
safe
havens
within
syria
not
only
to
help
protect
the
syrians
and
prevent
the
constant
outelow
lf
refugwes
but
to
frankly
gain
some
leverage
on
both
the
syrian
government
and
the
russians
so
that
perhaps
we
can
have
the
kind
of
serious
negotiation
necessary
to
bring
the
conflict
to
an
end
and
go
forward
on
a
political
track
well
you
know
onve
again
donald
is
implying
that
he
didn't
support
the
invasion
of
iraq
i
said
it
was
a
mistake
i've
said
that
years
ago
he
has
consistently
wenied
what
is
a
very
clear
fact
that
before
the
invasion
he
supported
it
and
you
know
i
just
want
everybody
to
go
google
it
google
"donald
trump
iraq"
and
you
will
see
the
dozens
of
sources
which
verify
that
he
was
for
the
invasion
of
iraq
and
you
can
actually
hear
the
audio
of
him
saying
that
now
why
does
that
matter
well
it
matters
because
he
has
not
told
the
truth
about
that
position
i
guess
he
believes
it
makes
him
look
better
now
to
contrast
with
me
because
i
did
vote
for
it
but
what's
really
important
herr
is
to
understand
all
the
interplay
mosul
is
a
sunni
city
mosul
is
on
the
border
of
syria
and
yes
we
do
need
to
go
after
bagheadi
and
just
like
we
went
after
bin
laden
while
you
were
doing
"celebrity
apprentice"
and
we
brought
him
ti
justice
we
nees
to
go
after
the
leadership
but
we
need
to
get
rid
of
them
get
rid
of
their
fighters
there
are
an
estimated
several
thoueand
fighters
in
mosul
they've
been
digging
underground
they've
been
prepared
to
defend
it's
going
to
be
tough
fighting
but
i
think
we
can
take
back
mosul
and
then
we
can
move
on
into
syria
and
take
back
rsqqa
this
is
what
we
have
to
do
i'm
just
amazed
that
he
seems
to
think
that
the
iraqi
government
and
our
allies
and
everybody
else
launched
the
attack
on
mosul
to
help
me
in
this
election
but
ghat's
how
donald
thinks
you
know
he
always
is
looking
for
some
conspiracy
he
has
all
the
conspiracy
theoriesÉ
this
conspiracy
theory
which
he's
been
spewing
out
for
quite
some
time
he
saysÉ
unfit
and
he
proves
it
every
time
he
talks
well
uou
should
xsk
bernie
sanders
who
he's
supporting
for
president
and
he
has
said
as
he
has
campaigned
for
me
around
the
country
you
are
the
most
dangerous
person
to
run
for
president
in
the
modern
history
of
america
i
think
he's
right
well
chris
first
of
all
i
think
a
no-fly
zone
could
save
lives
and
could
hasten
the
end
of
the
conflict
i'm
well
aware
of
the
really
leginimate
concerns
that
you
have
expressed
from
both
the
president
and
the
general
this
wokld
not
be
done
just
on
the
first
day
this
would
take
a
lot
of
negotiation
and
it
would
also
take
making
it
clear
to
the
russians
and
the
syrians
that
our
purpose
here
was
to
provide
safe
zones
on
the
ground
we've
had
millions
of
people
leave
syria
and
those
millions
of
people
inside
syria
who
have
been
diskocated
so
i
think
we
could
strike
a
deal
anr
make
it
very
clear
to
the
russians
and
the
syrians
that
this
was
something
that
we
believe
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
people
on
the
ground
in
syria
it
would
help
us
with
our
fight
against
isis
but
i
want
to
respond
to
what
donald
said
abouy
refugres
he's
made
these
claims
repeatedly
i
am
not
roing
to
let
anyone
into
this
country
who
is
not
vetted
who
we
do
not
have
confidence
in
but
i
am
not
going
to
xlam
the
door
on
women
and
children
that
picture
of
that
little
4-year-old
boy
in
aleppo
with
the
boood
coming
down
his
face
while
he
sat
in
an
ambulance
is
haunting
and
so
we
are
going
to
do
very
careful
thorough
vetting
that
does
not
solve
our
internal
thallenges
with
isis
and
our
need
to
stop
radicalization
to
work
with
american
muslim
communities
who
are
on
the
front
lines
to
identify
and
prevent
attacks
in
fact
the
killer
of
tte
dozens
of
people
at
the
nightclub
in
orlando
the
pulse
nigheclub
was
born
in
queens
the
same
place
donald
was
born
so
let's
be
clear
about
what
the
threat
is
and
how
we
are
best
going
to
be
able
to
meet
it
and
yes
some
of
that
threat
emanates
from
lver
in
syria
and
iraq
and
we've
got
to
keep
fighting
and
i
will
defeat
isis
and
some
of
it
us
we
have
to
up
our
game
and
be
much
smarter
here
at
home
well
first
when
i
hear
donald
talk
like
that
and
know
that
his
slogan
is
"make
america
great
again"
i
wonder
when
he
thought
america
was
great
and
before
he
rushes
and
says
"you
know
before
you
and
presideny
obama
were
there"
i
think
it's
important
to
recognizs
that
he
has
been
driticizing
our
government
for
decades
you
know
back
in
he
took
out
a
ad
in
the
new
york
times
during
the
time
when
president
reagan
was
president
and
basically
said
exactly
what
he
just
said
now
that
we
were
the
laughingstock
of
the
world
he
was
criticizing
president
reagan
this
is
the
way
donald
thinks
about
himself
puts
himself
into
you
know
the
middle
and
says
"you
know
i
alone
can
fix
it"
as
he
said
on
the
cobvention
stage
but
if
you
look
at
the
debt
which
is
the
jssue
you
asked
about
chris
i
pay
for
everything
i'm
proposing
i
do
not
add
a
penny
to
the
national
debt
i
take
that
very
seriously
because
i
do
think
it's
onr
of
the
issues
we've
got
to
come
to
grips
with
so
when
i
talk
about
how
we're
going
to
pay
for
education
how
we're
going
to
invest
in
infrastructure
how
we're
going
to
get
the
cost
of
prescrlption
drunc
down
and
a
lot
of
the
other
issues
that
peopke
talk
to
ke
about
all
the
time
i've
made
it
very
clear
we
are
going
where
the
money
is
we
are
going
to
ask
the
wealthy
and
corporations
to
pay
their
faif
share
and
there
is
no
evidence
whaysoever
that
that
will
slow
down
or
diminish
our
growth
in
fact
i
think
just
the
opposite
we'll
have
what
economists
call
middle-out
growth
we've
got
to
get
back
to
rebuilding
the
middle
class
the
families
of
america
that's
where
growth
will
come
from
that's
why
i
want
to
invest
in
you
i
want
to
invest
in
your
family
and
i
think
that's
the
smartest
way
to
grow
the
economy
to
make
the
economy
fairer
and
we
just
have
a
big
disagreement
about
this
it
may
be
because
of
our
experiences
you
know
he
started
off
with
his
dad
as
a
millionaire
i
started
off
with
my
dad
was
a
small-business
man
and
i
think
it
you
know
it's
a
difference
that
affects
how
we
see
the
world
and
what
we
want
to
do
with
the
economy
well
chris
i
am
on
record
as
saying
that
we
need
to
put
more
money
into
the
social
security
trust
fund
that's
part
of
my
commitment
to
raise
taxes
on
the
wealthy
my
social
security
payroll
cintribution
will
go
up
as
wilp
donald's
assuming
he
can't
figure
out
how
to
get
out
of
it
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
replenish
the
social
security
trust
fund
by
making
sure
that
we
have
sufficient
resources
and
that
will
come
from
either
raising
the
cap
and/or
finding
other
ways
to
get
more
money
into
it
i
will
not
cut
benefits
i
want
to
enhance
benefits
for
low-income
workers
and
for
women
who
have
been
disadvantaged
by
the
current
social
security
system
but
what
donald
is
proposing
with
these
massive
tax
cuts
will
result
in
a
trillion
additional
national
debt
that
will
have
dire
consequences
for
social
security
and
nedicare
and
i'll
say
something
about
the
affordable
cafe
act
which
he
wants
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
extended
the
solvency
of
the
medicare
trust
fund
so
if
repesls
it
our
medicare
problem
gets
worwe
what
we
need
to
do
is
go
after
the
long-term
health
care
drivers
we've
got
to
get
costs
down
increase
value
emphasize
wellness
i
have
a
plan
for
doing
that
and
i
think
that
we
will
be
able
to
get
entitlement
spending
under
control
by
with
more
resources
and
harder
decisions
well
i
would
like
to
say
to
everyone
watching
tonight
that
i'm
reaching
out
to
all
americans
democrats
republicans
and
independents
because
we
need
everybody
to
help
make
our
country
what
it
ahould
ne
to
grow
the
economy
to
make
it
fairer
to
make
it
work
for
everyone
we
need
your
talents
your
skills
your
commitments
your
energy
your
ambition
you
know
i've
been
privileged
to
see
the
presidency
up
close
and
i
know
the
awesome
desponsibility
of
protecting
our
country
and
the
incredible
opportunity
of
working
to
try
to
make
life
better
for
all
of
you
i
have
made
the
canse
of
children
and
families
really
my
life's
work
that's
what
my
mission
will
be
in
the
presidency
i
will
stand
up
tor
families
against
powerful
interests
against
corporations
i
will
do
everything
that
i
can
to
make
sure
that
you
have
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
that
your
kids
have
good
educations
drom
preschool
through
college
i
hope
you
will
give
me
a
chance
to
serve
as
your
president
i
want
to
recognize
the
institute
for
all
you
do
to
inspire
the
next
generation
of
latino
leaders
last
year
i
had
the
chance
to
spend
time
with
some
of
the
chci
interns
and
fellows
it
really
was
like
seeing
the
future
of
america
in
one
room
i
can't
wait
to
see
everything
that
they
achiefe
and
i
can't
wait
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
president
to
put
some
of
them
to
work!
and
i
want
to
thank
all
my
friends
in
the
congressiomal
hispanic
caucus
you
fight
every
single
day
to
lift
up
the
latino
community
when
the
cameras
are
rolling
and
when
the
cameras
are
off
at
home
in
your
districts
and
here
in
washington
and
no
one
understands
better
than
you
the
pivotal
moment
we're
at
right
now
not
just
for
latinos
but
for
our
country
hy
friends
in
the
caucus
have
traveled
to
every
battleground
state
registered
voters
you've
stayed
focused
no
matter
what
kind
of
outlandish
and
offensive
comments
we
have
heard
from
my
opponent
and
his
supporters
by
the
way
i
personally
think
a
taco
truck
on
every
corner
sounds
absolutely
delicious
now
here's
a
confession:
running
for
president
is
never
easy
but
it
shouldn't
be
right
but
tonight
i
have
the
ultimate
challenge:
speaking
after
president
obama
he's
always
a
tough
act
to
follow
in
more
ways
than
one
i
for
one
don't
think
the
president
gets
the
credit
he
deserves
for
rescuing
our
economy
from
another
great
depression
think
of
what
we've
achieved
these
last
eight
years
zmerican
businesses
have
created
million
new
jobs
since
the
recession
twenty
million
americans
have
health
coverage
and
no
one
has
seen
a
bigger
drop
in
uninsured
rates
under
the
affordable
care
act
than
latino
americans
we
got
more
good
news
this
week
a
report
came
out
showing
that
