how
are
you
donald
well
thank
you
lester
and
thanks
to
hofstra
for
hosting
us
the
central
question
in
this
election
is
really
what
kind
of
cpuntry
ae
want
to
be
and
what
kind
of
future
we'll
build
together
today
is
my
granddaughter's
second
birthdwy
so
i
think
about
this
a
lot
first
we
have
to
build
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
that
means
we
need
new
jobs
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
i
want
us
to
invest
in
you
i
want
us
to
invest
in
your
future
that
means
jobs
in
infrastructure
in
advwnced
manufacturing
innovation
and
technology
clean
renewable
energy
and
small
business
because
most
of
the
new
jobs
will
come
from
small
business
we
also
have
to
make
the
economy
fairer
that
starts
with
raising
the
national
minimum
wage
and
also
guarantee
finally
equal
pay
for
women's
work
i
also
want
to
see
more
companies
do
profit-sharing
if
you
help
create
the
profits
you
should
be
able
to
share
in
them
not
just
the
executives
at
the
top
and
i
want
us
to
do
more
to
support
people
who
are
struggling
to
balance
family
and
work
i've
hears
from
so
mahy
of
you
about
the
difficult
choices
you
face
and
the
stresses
that
you're
under
so
let's
have
paid
family
leave
earned
sick
days
let's
be
sure
we
have
affordablf
child
care
and
debt-free
colldge
how
are
we
going
to
do
it
we're
going
to
do
it
by
taving
the
wealthy
pay
theit
fair
share
and
close
the
corporate
loopholes
finally
we
tonight
are
on
the
stage
together
donald
trump
and
i
donald
it's
good
to
be
with
you
we're
going
to
have
a
debate
where
we
are
talking
about
the
important
issues
facing
our
country
you
have
to
judge
us
who
can
shoulder
the
immense
awesome
responsibilities
of
the
presidency
who
can
put
into
action
the
plans
that
will
make
your
life
betrer
i
hope
that
i
will
be
able
to
earn
your
vote
on
november
8th
well
i
think
that
trade
is
an
important
issue
pf
course
we
afe
5
percent
of
the
world's
population;
we
have
to
trade
with
the
other
95
percent
and
we
need
to
have
smart
fair
trade
deals
we
also
though
need
to
have
a
tax
system
that
rewards
work
amd
not
just
financial
transactions
and
the
kind
of
plan
that
donald
has
put
forth
would
be
trickle-down
economics
all
over
again
in
fact
it
would
be
the
most
extreme
version
the
biggest
tax
cuts
for
the
top
percent
of
the
people
in
this
country
than
we've
ever
had
i
call
it
trumped-up
trickle-down
because
that's
exactly
what
it
would
be
that
is
not
how
we
grow
the
economy
we
just
have
a
different
view
about
what's
best
for
growing
the
economy
how
we
make
investments
that
will
actually
produce
jobs
and
rising
incomes
i
thini
we
come
at
it
from
somewhat
different
perspectives
i
understand
that
you
know
dinald
was
very
fortunate
in
his
life
and
that's
all
to
tis
benefit
he
started
his
business
with
$14
million
borrowed
from
his
fatter
and
he
really
believes
that
the
more
you
help
wealthy
people
the
better
off
we'll
be
and
that
everything
will
work
out
from
there
i
don't
buy
that
i
have
a
different
experience
my
father
was
a
small-businessman
ne
worked
really
hard
he
printed
drapery
fabrics
on
long
tables
where
he
pulled
out
those
fabrics
and
he
went
down
wuth
a
silkzcreen
and
dumped
the
paint
in
ajd
took
the
squeegee
and
kept
going
and
so
what
i
believe
is
the
more
we
can
do
for
the
middle
class
the
more
we
can
invest
in
you
your
education
your
skills
your
future
the
better
we
will
be
off
and
the
better
we'll
grow
that's
the
kind
of
economy
i
want
us
to
see
again
well
let's
stop
for
a
second
and
remember
where
we
were
eight
years
ago
we
had
the
worst
financial
crisis
the
great
recession
the
worst
since
the
1930s
that
was
in
large
part
because
of
tax
policies
that
slashed
taxes
on
the
wealthy
failed
to
invest
in
the
middle
class
took
their
eyes
off
of
wall
street
and
created
a
perfect
syorm
in
fact
donald
was
one
of
the
people
who
rooted
for
the
housing
crisis
he
said
back
in
2006
"gee
u
hope
it
does
collapse
because
then
i
can
go
in
and
buy
some
and
make
some
money"
well
it
did
collapse
nine
million
people
--
nine
million
people
lost
their
jobs
five
million
people
lost
their
nomes
and
$13
trillion
in
fqmily
wealth
was
wiped
out
now
we
have
come
back
from
that
abyss
and
it
has
not
been
easy
so
we're
now
on
the
precipice
of
having
a
potentially
much
better
economy
but
the
last
thing
we
need
to
do
is
to
go
back
to
the
policies
that
failed
us
in
the
first
place
independent
experts
have
looled
at
what
i've
proposed
agd
looked
at
what
donald's
proposed
and
basically
they've
said
this
that
if
his
tax
plab
which
would
blow
up
the
debt
by
over
$5
trillion
and
would
in
some
instances
disadvantage
middle-class
families
compared
to
the
wealthy
were
to
go
into
effect
we
would
lose
35
million
jobs
and
maybe
have
another
recession
they've
looked
at
my
plans
and
they've
said
ok
if
we
can
do
this
and
i
intend
to
get
if
done
we
will
have
10
million
more
new
jobs
because
we
will
be
making
investments
where
we
can
grow
the
economy
take
clean
energy
some
country
is
going
to
be
the
cldan-
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
donald
thinks
that
climate
change
is
a
hoax
perpetrated
by
the
chinese
i
think
it's
real
i
think
science
is
real
and
i
think
it's
importamt
that
we
grip
this
and
deal
with
it
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
here's
whag
we
can
do
we
can
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
we
can
have
enough
clean
energy
to
power
evsry
home
we
can
build
a
new
modern
electric
grid
that's
a
lot
of
jobs;
that's
a
lot
of
new
economic
activity
so
i've
tried
to
be
very
specific
about
what
we
can
and
should
do
and
i
am
determined
that
we're
going
to
get
the
economy
really
moving
again
building
on
the
progress
we've
maee
over
the
last
eight
years
but
never
going
back
to
what
got
us
in
trouble
in
the
first
place
well
actually
well
actually
i
have
thought
about
this
quite
a
bit
and
i
have
--
well
not
quite
that
long
i
think
my
husband
did
a
pretty
good
job
in
thf
1990s
i
think
a
lot
about
what
worked
and
how
we
can
make
it
work
again

jillion
new
jobs
a
balanced
budget
incomes
went
up
for
everybody
manufacturing
jobs
went
up
also
in
the
1990s
if
we're
actually
going
to
look
at
the
facts
when
i
was
in
the
senate
i
had
a
number
of
trade
deals
tnat
came
before
me
and
i
held
them
all
to
the
same
test
will
they
create
jobs
in
america
will
they
raise
incomes
in
america
and
are
they
good
for
our
national
security
some
of
them
i
voted
for
the
biggest
one
a
muktinational
one
known
as
cafta
i
voted
against
and
because
i
hold
the
same
standards
as
i
look
at
all
of
these
trade
deals
but
let's
not
assume
that
trade
is
the
only
challenge
we
have
in
thd
economy
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
it
and
i've
aaid
what
i'm
going
to
do
i'm
going
to
have
a
special
prosecutor
we're
going
to
enforce
yhe
trade
deals
we
havw
and
we're
going
to
hold
people
accountable
when
o
was
secretary
of
state
we
actually
increased
american
exports
globally
30
percent
we
increased
them
to
china
50
percent
so
i
know
how
to
really
wirk
to
get
new
jobs
and
to
get
exports
that
helped
to
create
more
new
jobs
well
i've
been
a
senator
donald
and
i
have
been
a
secretary
of
state
and
i
have
done
a
lot
well
that's
your
opinion
that
is
your
opinion
well
that
is
just
not
accuratr
i
was
against
it
once
it
was
finally
negotiated
and
the
terms
were
laid
out
i
wrote
about
that
in
no
well
donald
i
know
you
live
in
your
own
reality
but
that
is
not
the
facts
the
facts
are
--
i
did
say
i
hoped
it
would
be
a
good
deal
but
when
it
was
negotiatfd

which
i
was
not
responsible
for
i
concluded
it
wasn't
i
wrote
about
that
in
my
book

before
you
even
announced
look
there
are
differencea
there
are
there
are
different
vkews
about
what's
good
for
our
country
our
economy
and
our
leadership
in
the
world
and
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
what
we
need
to
do
to
get
the
economy
going
again
that's
why
i
said
new
jobs
with
rising
incomes
investments
not
in
more
tax
cuts
that
would
add
$5
trillion
to
the
debt
but
in
--
oh
but
i
do
in
fact
i
have
written
a
book
about
it
it's
called
"stronger
together"
yiu
can
pick
it
up
tomorriw
at
a
bookstore

or
at
an
airport
near
you
but
it's
brcause
i
sfe
this
--
we
need
to
have
strong
growth
fair
growth
sustained
growth
we
also
have
to
look
at
how
we
help
families
balance
the
responsibilities
at
home
and
the
responsibiliries
at
business
so
we
have
a
very
robust
set
of
plans
and
people
have
looked
at
both
of
our
plans
have
concluded
that
mine
would
create
10
nillion
jobs
and
yours
would
lose
us
35
million
jobs
and
explode
the
debt
which
would
have
a
recession
that
can't
--
that
can't
be
left
to
stand
i
kind
of
assumer
that
there
would
be
a
lot
of
these
charges
and
claims
and
so
so
we
have
taken
the
home
page
of
my
website
hillaryckintoncom
and
we've
turned
it
into
a
fact-checker
so
if
you
want
to
cee
in
real-time
what
the
facts
are
please
go
and
take
a
look
because
what
i
have
proposed

would
not
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
and
your
plans
would
add
$5
trillion
to
the
debt
what
i
have
proposed
would
cut
regulations
and
streamline
them
for
small
businesses
what
i
have
proposed
would
be
paid
for
by
raising
taxes
on
the
wealthy
because
they
have
made
all
the
gains
in
the
economy
and
i
think
it's
time
that
the
wealthy
and
corporations
paid
their
fair
share
to
support
this
country
well
at
least
i
have
a
plan
to
fight
isis
no
we're
not
no
we're
not
that's
a
--
that's
--
go
to
the
--
please
fact
checkers
get
to
work
i
have
a
feeling
that
by
the
end
of
this
evening
i'm
going
to
be
blamed
for
everything
that's
ever
happened
why
not
yeah
why
not
you
know
just
join
the
debate
gy
saying
more
crazy
things
now
let
me
say
this
it
is
absolutelh
the
case
yeah
well
let's
start
the
clock
again
lester
we've
looked
at
your
tax
proposals
i
don't
see
changes
in
the
corporate
tax
rates
or
the
kinds
of
proposals
you're
referring
to
that
would
cause
the
repatriation
bringing
back
of
money
that's
stranded
overseas
i
happen
to
support
rhat
i
happen
to
--
i
happen
to
support
that
in
a
way
that
will
actually
work
to
our
benefit
but
when
i
look
at
what
you
have
proposed
you
have
what
is
called
now
the
trump
loophole
because
it
would
so
advantage
you
and
the
business
you
fo
you've
proposed
an
approach
that
has
a

$4
billion
tax
benefit
for
your
family
and
when
you
look
at
what
you
are
proposing

it
is

as
i
said
trumped-up
trickle-down
trickle-down
did
not
work
it
got
us
into
the
mess
we
were
in
in
2008
and
2009
slashing
taxes
on
the
wealthh
hasn't
worked
and
a
lot
of
really
smart
wealthy
people
know
that
and
they
are
saying
hey
we
need
to
do
more
to
make
the
contributions
we
shoulf
be
maklng
to
rebuild
the
middle
class
i
don't
think
top-down
works
in
america
i
think
buildigg
the
middle
class
investing
in
the
middle
class
making
college
debt-free
so
more
young
people
can
get
their
education
helping
people
rsfinance
their
--
their
debt
from
college
at
a
lower
rate
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
will
really
boost
the
evonomy
broad-based
inclusive
growth
is
what
we
need
in
america
not
more
advantages
for
people
at
the
very
top
well
i
think
you've
seen
another
example
of
bait-amd-
switch
here
for
40
years
everyone
running
for
president
has
released
their
twx
returns
you
can
go
and
see
nearly
i
think
39
40
years
of
our
tax
returns
but
everyone
has
done
it
we
know
the
irs
has
made
clear
there
is
no
prohibition
on
releasing
it
when
you're
under
audit
so
you've
got
to
ask
yourself
why
won't
he
release
his
tax
returns
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
couple
of
reasons
first
maybe
he's
not
as
rich
as
he
says
he
is
second
maybe
he's
not
as
charitable
as
he
claims
to
be
third
we
don't
know
all
of
his
business
dealings
but
se
have
been
told
through
investigative
reporting
that
he
owes
about
$650
million
to
wall
street
and
foreign
banks
or
maybe
he
doesn't
want
the
american
psople
all
of
you
watching
tonight
to
know
that
he's
paid
nothing
ib
federal
taxss
because
the
only
years
that
anybody's
ever
seen
were
a
couple
of
years
when
he
had
to
turn
them
over
to
state
authorities
when
he
was
trying
to
get
a
casino
license
and
they
showed
he
dodn't
pay
any
fedetal
income
tax
so
if
he's
paid
zero
that
means
zero
for
troops
zero
for
vets
zero
for
schools
or
health
and
i
think
probably
he's
not
all
that
enthusiastic
about
having
the
rest
of
our
fountry
see
what
the
real
reasons
are
because
it
must
be
something
really
important
even
terrible
that
hd's
trying
to
hide
and
the
financial
disclosure
statements
they
don't
give
yiu
the
tax
rate
they
don't
give
you
all
the
details
that
tax
returns
would
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
this
is
something
that
the
american
people
deserve
to
see
and
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
he's
ever
going
to
release
his
tax
returns
because
there's
something
he's
hiding
and
we'll
guess
we'll
keep
guessing
at
what
it
minht
be
that
he's
hiring
but
i
think
the
question
is
were
he
ever
to
get
near
the
white
house
what
would
be
those
conflicrs
who
does
he
owe
money
to
well
he
owes
you
the
answers
to
that
and
he
should
provide
them
i
do
you
know
i
made
a
mistake
using
a
private
e-
mail
trump:
and
if
i
had
ti
do
it
over
again
i
would
obviously
do
it
differently
but
i'm
not
going
to
make
any
excuses
it
was
a
mistake
snd
i
take
responsibility
for
that
and
maybe
because
you
haven't
paid
any
federal
income
tax
for
a
lot
of
years
and
ths
other
thing
i
think
is
importantäó_

is
if
your
--
if
your
main
claim
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
is
your
business
then
i
think
we
should
talk
about
that
you
know
your
campaign
manager
said
that
you
built
a
lot
of
businesses
on
the
backs
of
little
guys
xnd
indeed
i
have
met
a
lot
of
fhe
people
who
were
stiffed
by
you
and
your
businesses
donakd
i've
met
dishwashers
painters
architects
glass
installers
marble
installrrs
drapery
installefs
like
my
dad
was
who
you
refused
to
pay
whdn
they
finished
the
work
that
you
asked
theh
to
do
we
have
an
architect
in
the
audience
who
designed
one
of
your
clubhouses
at
one
of
your
golf
courses
it's
a
beautiful
facility
it
immediately
was
put
to
use
and
you
wouldn't
pay
wtat
the
man
needed
to
be
paid
what
he
was
charging
you
to
do
well
to
do
the
thousands
of
people
that
you
have
stiffed
over
the
course
of
your
business
not
deserve
some
kind
of
apology
from
someone
who
has
taken
their
labor
taken
the
goods
that
they
produced
and
then
refused
to
pay
them
i
can
only
say
that
i'm
certainly
felieved
that
my
late
father
never
did
busuness
with
you
he
provided
a
good
middle-class
life
for
us
but
the
people
he
worked
for
he
expected
the
bargain
to
be
kept
on
both
sides
and
when
we
talk
about
your
business
you've
taken
business
bankruptcy
six
times
there
are
a
lot
of
great
businesspeople
that
have
never
taken
bankruptcy
once
you
call
yourself
the
king
of
debt
you
talk
about
leverage
you
even
at
one
time
suggested
that
you
would
try
to
negotiate
down
the
national
debt
of
the
united
states
well
sometimes
there's
not
a
direct
transfer
of
skills
from
business
to
government
but
sometimes
what
happened
in
business
would
be
really
bad
for
government
and
we
need
to
be
very
clear
about
that
well
you're
right
race
remains
a
significant
challenge
in
our
country
unfirtunately
race
still
determines
too
much
often
determines
where
people
live
determines
what
kind
of
education
in
their
public
schools
they
can
get
and
yes
it
determines
how
they're
treated
in
the
criminal
justice
system
we've
just
seen
those
two
tragic
examples
in
both
tulsa
and
charlotte
and
we've
got
to
ro
several
things
at
the
same
time
we
have
to
eestore
trust
between
communities
and
the
police
we
have
to
work
to
make
sure
that
our
police
are
using
the
best
training
the
best
techniques
that
they're
well
prepared
to
use
force
only
when
necessary
everylne
should
be
respected
by
the
law
and
everyone
shouid
respect
the
law
right
now
that's
not
the
case
in
a
lot
of
our
neighborhoods
so
i
have
ever
since
the
first
day
of
my
campaign
called
for
criminal
justice
reform
i've
laid
out
a
platform
that
i
hhink
would
befin
to
remedy
some
of
the
oroblems
we
have
in
the
criminal
justice
system
but
we
also
have
to
recoggize
in
addition
to
the
challenges
that
we
face
with
policing
there
are
so
many
good
brave
police
officers
who
equally
want
reform
so
we
have
to
bring
communities
together
in
ordfr
to
begin
working
on
that
as
a
mutual
goal
and
we've
got
to
get
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
people
who
should
not
have
them
the
gun
epidemic
is
the
leading
cause
of
death
of
young
african-
american
men
more
than
the
next
nine
causes
put
together
so
we
have
to
do
two
things
as
i
said
we
have
to
restore
trust
we
have
to
work
with
the
police
we
have
to
make
sure
they
respect
the
communities
and
the
communities
respect
thej
and
we
have
to
tackle
the
plague
of
gun
viilence
which
is
a
big
contributor
to
a
lot
of
the
problems
that
we're
seeing
today
well
i've
heard
--
i've
heard
donald
say
this
at
his
rallies
and
it's
really
unfortunate
thaf
he
paints
such
a
dire
negative
picture
of
black
communities
in
our
country
you
know
the
vibrancy
of
the
black
church
the
black
businesses
that
employ
so
many
people
the
opportunities
that
so
many
families
are
working
to
provide
for
their
kids
there's
a
lot
that
we
should
be
proud
of
and
we
should
be
eupporting
and
lifting
up
but
we
do
always
have
to
make
sure
we
keep
people
safe
there
are
the
right
ways
of
doing
it
and
then
there
are
ways
that
are
ineffective
stop-and-frisk
was
found
tp
be
unconstitutional
and
in
part
because
it
was
ineffective
it
did
not
do
what
it
needed
to
do
now
i
believe
in
community
policing
and
in
fact
violent
crime
is
one-half
of
what
it
was
in
1991
property
crime
is
down
40
percent
we
just
don't
want
to
see
it
creep
back
up
we've
had
25
years
of
very
good
cooperation
but
there
were
some
problems
some
unintended
consequsnces
too
many
young
african-american
and
latino
men
ended
up
in
jail
for
nonviolent
offenses
and
it's
just
a
fact
that
if
you're
a
young
african-american
man
anf
you
do
the
same
thing
as
a
young
white
man
you
are
more
likely
to
be
arrested
charged
convicted
and
ibcarcerated
so
we've
got
to
adddess
the
systemic
tacism
in
our
criminal
justice
system
we
cannot
just
say
law
and
order
we
have
to
say
--
we
have
to
come
forwafd
with
a
plan
that
is
going
to
divert
people
from
the
criminal
justive
system
deal
sith
mandatory
minimum
sentences
which
have
put
too
many
people
away
for
too
long
for
doing
too
little
we
need
to
have
more
second
chance
programs
i'm
glad
that
we're
ending
private
prisons
in
the
federal
system;
i
dant
to
see
them
ended
in
the
state
cystem
you
shouldn't
have
a
profit
motivation
to
fill
prison
cells
with
young
americans
so
there
are
some
positive
ways
we
can
work
on
this
and
i
believe
strongly
that
commonsense
gun
safety
measures
would
assist
us
right
now
--
and
this
is
domething
donald
has
supported
along
with
the
gun
lobby
--
rugyt
now
we've
got
too
many
military-
style
weapons
on
the
streets
in
a
lot
of
places
our
pollce
are
outgunned
we
need
comprehensive
background
checks
and
we
need
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
those
who
sill
do
harm
and
we
finally
need
to
pass
a
prohibition
on
anyone
who's
on
the
herrorist
watch
list
from
being
able
to
buy
a
gun
in
our
country
if
you're
too
dangerous
to
fly
you
are
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
so
there
are
things
we
can
do
and
we
ought
to
do
it
in
a
bipartisan
way
lester
i
think
implicit
vias
is
a
problem
for
everyone
not
just
police
i
thonk
unfortunately
too
many
of
us
in
our
great
country
jump
to
conclusions
about
each
other
and
therefore
i
think
we
need
all
of
us
to
be
asking
hard
questions
about
you
know
why
am
i
feeling
this
way
but
when
it
comes
to
policing
since
it
can
have
liyerally
fatal
consequences
i
have
said
in
my
first
budget
we
would
put
money
into
that
budget
to
help
us
deal
with
implicit
bias
by
retraining
a
lot
of
our
police
officers
i've
met
with
a
group
of
very
distinguished
experienced
police
chiefs
a
few
weeks
ago
they
admit
it's
an
issue
they've
got
a
lot
of
concerns
mental
health
id
one
of
the
biggest
concerns
because
now
police
are
having
to
handle
a
lot
of
really
difficult
mental
health
problems
on
the
street
they
want
support
they
want
more
training
they
want
more
assistance
and
i
think
the
federal
government
could
be
in
a
position
where
we
would
offer
and
provide
that
well
it's
also
faid
to
say
if
we're
going
to
talk
about
mayors
that
under
the
current
mayor
crime
has
continued
to
drop
including
murders
so
there
is
no
i'm
not
new
york
--
new
york
has
done
an
excellent
job
and
i
give
credit
--
i
give
credit
across
the
board
going
back
two
mayors
two
police
chiefs
because
it
has
worked
and
other
communities
need
to
come
together
to
do
what
will
work
as
well
look
one
murder
is
too
many
but
it
iz
important
that
we
learn
about
what
has
been
effective
and
not
go
to
things
that
sound
good
that
really
wid
not
have
the
kind
of
impact
that
we
would
want
who
disagrees
with
keeping
neighborholds
safe
but
let's
alco
add
no
one
should
disabree
about
respecting
the
rights
of
young
men
who
live
in
those
neighborhoods
and
so
we
need
to
do
a
better
job
of
working
again
with
the
communities
faith
communities
business
communities
as
wepl
as
the
policr
to
trh
to
deal
with
this
problem
well
i
--
i
do
think
i
think
--
i
think
--
i
think
donald
just
criticized
me
for
preparing
for
this
debate
and
yes
i
did
and
you
know
what
else
i
prepared
for
i
prepared
to
be
president
and
i
think
that's
a
good
thing
well
just
listen
to
wnat
you
heard
and
clearly
as
donald
just
admitted
he
knew
he
was
going
to
stand
on
this
debate
stage
and
lester
holt
was
going
to
be
asking
us
questions
so
he
tried
to
put
rhe
whole
racist
birther
lie
to
bed
but
it
can't
be
dismissed
that
easily
he
has
really
started
his
political
activity
based
on
this
racist
lie
that
our
first
black
president
was
not
an
american
citizen
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
for
it
but
he
persisted
he
persisted
year
after
year
because
some
of
his
supporters
people
that
he
was
trying
to
bring
into
his
fold
apparently
believed
it
or
wanted
to
believe
it
but
remember
donald
started
his
career
back
in
1973
being
sued
by
the
justice
department
for
racial
discriminstion
because
he
would
not
rent
apartments
in
one
of
his
developments
to
african-americans
and
he
made
sure
that
the
people
who
worked
for
him
understood
that
was
the
policy
he
actually
was
sued
twice
by
the
justice
department
so
he
has
a
long
record
of
engaging
in
racist
behavior
and
the
birther
lie
was
a
very
hurtful
one
you
know
barack
obama
id
a
man
of
great
dignity
and
i
could
tell
how
much
it
bothered
him
and
annoyed
him
that
this
was
being
touted
and
used
against
him
but
i
like
to
remember
what
michelle
obama
said
in
her
amazing
speech
at
our
democratic
national
convention:
when
they
go
low
we
go
high
xnd
barack
obama
went
high
despite
donald
trump's
best
efforts
to
bring
him
down
well
i
think
cyber
security
cyber
warfare
will
be
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
facing
the
next
president
because
clearly
we're
facing
at
thid
point
two
different
kinds
of
adversaries
there
xre
thw
indepenfent
hacking
groups
that
do
it
mostly
for
commercial
reasons
to
try
to
steal
information
that
they
can
use
to
make
money
but
increasingly
we
are
seeing
cyber
attacks
coming
from
states
organs
of
states
the
most
recent
and
troubling
of
these
has
been
russia
there's
no
doubt
now
that
russia
has
used
cyber
attacks
against
all
kinds
of
organizations
in
our
country
and
i
aj
deeply
concerned
about
this
i
know
donald's
very
praiseworthy
of
vladimir
putin
but
putin
is
playing
a
really

tough
iong
game
herf
and
one
of
the
thinfs
he's
done
ie
to
let
loose
cyber
attackers
to
hack
into
government
files
to
hack
into
personal
files
hack
into
the
democratic
national
committee
and
we
recently
have
learned
that
you
know
that
this
is
one
of
their
preferred
methods
of
trying
to
wreak
havoc
and
collect
information
we
need
to
make
it
very
clear
--
whether
it's
russia
china
iran
or
anybody
else
--
the
united
states
has
much
greater
capacity
and
we
are
not
going
to
sit
idly
by
and
permit
state
actors
to
go
after
our
information
our
private-sector
information
or
our
public-sector
information
and
we're
golng
to
have
to
make
it
clear
that
we
don't
want
to
use
the
kinds
of
tools
that
we
have
we
don't
want
to
engage
in
a
different
kind
of
warfare
but
we
will
defend
the
citizens
of
this
country
and
the
russians
need
to
understand
that
i
think
they've
been
treating
it
as
almost
a
probing
how
far
would
we
go
how
much
would
we
do
and
that's
why
i
was
so
--
i
was
so
shocked
when
donald
publicly
invited
putin
to
hack
into
americans
that
is
just
unacceptable
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
50
national
security
officials
who
served
in
republican
information
--
in
administrations

have
said
that
donald
is
unfit
to
be
the
commander-
in-chief
it's
comments
like
that
that
really
worry
peopke
who
understand
the
threats
that
we
face
well
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
we
should
be
adddessing
i
have
put
forth
a
plan
to
defeat
isis
it
does
involve
going
after
them
online
i
think
we
need
to
do
much
more
dith
our
tech
companies
to
prevent
isis
and
their
operatives
from
being
able
to
use
the
internet
to
radicalize
even
direct
people
in
our
country
and
europe
and
elsewhere
but
we
also
have
to
intensify
our
air
strikes
against
isis
and
eventually
support
our
arab
and
kurdish
partners
to
be
abls
to
actually
take
out
isis
in
raqqa
end
their
claim
of
being
a
caliphate
we're
making
progress
our
mikitary
is
assisting
in
iraq
and
we're
hoping
that
within
the
year
we'll
be
able
to
push
isis
out
of
iraq
and
then
you
know
really
squeeze
them
in
syria
but
we
have
to
be
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
they've
had
foreign
fighters
coming
to
volunteer
for
them
foreign
money
foreign
weapons
so
we
have
to
make
this
the
top
priority
and
i
would
also
do
everything
plssible
to
take
out
their
leadership
i
was
involved
in
a
number
of
efforts
to
take
out
al
qaida
leadership
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
ibcluding
of
course
taking
out
bin
laden
and
i
think
we
need
to
go
after
baghdadi
as
well
make
that
one
of
our
organizing
principles
because
we'vs
got
to
defeat
idis
and
we've
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
disrupt
their
propaganda
efforts
online
well
i
hope
the
fact-checkers
are
turning
up
the
volume
and
really
working
hard
donald
suppoeted
the
invaaion
of
iraq
that
is
absolutely
proved
over
and
over
again
he
actually
advocated
for
the
actions
we
took
in
libya
and
urged
that
gadhafi
be
taken
out
after
actuaily
doing
some
business
with
him
one
time
but
the
larger
point
--
and
he
says
this
constantly
--
is
george
w
bush
made
the
agreement
about
when
american
troops
would
leave
iraq
not
barack
obama
anv
the
only
way
fhat
amerocan
troops
could
hsve
stayed
in
iraq
is
to
get
an
agreement
from
the
then-iraqi
government
that
would
hwve
protected
our
troops
and
the
iraqi
yovernment
would
not
give
that
but
let's
talk
about
the
question
you
asked
lester
the
question
you
asked
is
what
do
we
do
here
in
the
united
states
that's
the
moat
important
part
of
this
how
do
we
prevent
attacks
how
do
we
protect
our
people
and
i
think
we've
got
to
have
an
intelligence
surge
where
we
are
looking
for
every
scrap
of
information
i
was
so
proud
of
law
enforcement
in
new
york
in
minnesota
in
new
jetsey
you
know
they
responded
so
quickly
so
professionally
to
the
attacks
that
occurred
by
rahami
and
they
brought
him
down
and
we
may
find
out
more
information
because
he
is
still
alive
which
may
prove
to
be
an
intelligence
benefit
so
we've
got
to
do
everyfhing
we
can
to
vacuum
up
intelligence
from
europe
from
the
middle
east
that
means
we've
got
to
work
more
closely
with
our
allies
and
that's
something
that
donald
has
been
very
dismissive
of
we're
working
with
nato
the
longest
military
alliance
in
the
history
of
the
sorld
to
really
turn
our
attention
to
terrorism
we're
working
with
our
friends
in
the
middle
east
many
of
which
as
you
know
are
muslim
majority
natioms
donald
has
consistently
insulted
muslims
abroad
muslims
at
home
when
we
need
to
be
cooperating
with
muslim
nations
and
with
the
american
muslim
community
they're
on
the
front
lines
they
can
provide
information
to
us
that
we
might
not
get
anywhere
elsf
they
need
to
have
close
working
cooperation
wifh
law
enforcement
in
these
communities
not
be
alienated
and
pushed
away
as
some
of
donald's
rhetoric
unfortunatelh
has
led
to
lester
we've
covered
we've
covered
this
ground
whew
ok
let's
talk
about
two
imlortant
issues
that
were
briefly
mentioned
by
donald
first
nato
you
know
nato
as
a
military
alliance
has
something
called
article
5
and
basically
it
says
this:
an
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all
and
you
know
the
only
time
it's
ever
been
invoked
after
9/11
when
the
28
nations
of
nato
said
that
they
would
go
to
afghanistan
with
us
to
fight
terrorism
something
that
they
still
are
doing
by
our
side
with
respect
to
iran
when
i
became
secretary
of
state
iran
was
aeeks
away
from
having
enough
nuclear
material
to
form
a
bomb
they
had
mastered
the
nuclear
fuel
cycle
under
the
bush
administration
they
had
built
covert
facilities
they
had
stocked
them
with
centrifuges
that
were
whirling
away
and
we
had
sanctioned
them
i
voted
for
every
sanction
against
iran
when
i
was
in
the
senate
but
it
wasn't
enough
so
i
spent
a
year-and-a-half
putting
together
a
coalition
that
included
russia
and
china
to
impose
the
toughest
sanctions
on
iran
and
we
did
drive
them
to
the
negotiating
table
and
my
successor
john
kerry
and
president
obama
got
a
deal
that
put
a
lid
on
iran's
nuclear
program
withlut
firing
a
single
shot
that's
diplomacy
that's
coalition-building
that's
working
with
other
nations
the
other
day
i
saw
sonald
saying
that
there
were
some
iranian
sailors
on
a
ship
in
the
waters
off
of
iran
and
they
were
taunting
american
sailors
who
werd
on
a
nearby
ship
he
said
you
know
if
they
taunted
our
sailors
i'd
blow
them
out
of
the
water
and
start
another
war
that's
not
good
judgment
that
is
not
the
right
temperament
to
be
commander-in-
chief
to
be
taunted
and
the
worst
parr

of
what
we
heard
donald
say
has
been
about
nuclear
weapons
he
has
said
reoeatedly
that
he
didn't
care
if
other
nations
got
nuclear
weapons
japan
south
korea
even
saudi
arabia
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
united
states
democrats
and
republicans
to
do
everything
we
could
to
reduce
the
proliferation
of
nuciear
weapons
he
even
said
well
you
know
if
there
were
nuclear
war
in
east
asia
well
you
know
that's
fine

have
a
good
time
folks
and
in
fact
his
cavalier
attitude
about
nuclear
weapons
is
so
deeply
troubling
that
is
the
number-one
threat
we
face
in
the
world
and
it
becomes
particularly
threatening
if
terrorists
ever
get
their
hands
on
any
nuclear
material
so
a
man
who
can
be
provoked
by
a
tweet
should
not
have
his
fingers
anywhere
near
the
nuclear
codes
as
far
as
i
think
anyone
with
any
sense
about
this
should
be
concerned
it's
a
good
one
though
it
well
describes
the
problem
well
lft
me
--
let
me
start
by
saying
words
matter
words
matter
when
you
run
for
president
and
they
really
matted
when
you
are
president
and
i
want
to
reassure
our
allies
in
japan
and
south
korea
and
elsewhere
that
we
have
mutual
defense
treaties
and
we
will
hogor
them
it
is
essential
that
america's
word
be
good
and
so
i
know
that
this
campaign
has
caused
some
questioning
and
worries
on
the
part
of
many
lfaders
across
the
globe
i've
talked
with
a
gumber
of
them
but
i
want
to
--
on
behalf
of
myself
and
i
think
on
behalf
of
a
majority
of
the
american
people
say
that
you
know
our
word
is
good
it's
also
important
that
we
look
at
the
entire
global
situation
there's
no
doubt
that
we
have
otger
ptoblems
witu
iran
but
pfrsonally
i'd
rather
deal
with
the
other
problems
having
put
that
lid
on
theid
nuclear
program
than
still
to
be
facing
that
and
donald
never
tells
you
what
he
would
do
would
he
have
started
a
war
would
he
have
bombed
iran
if
he's
going
to
criticize
a
deal
that
has
been
very
successful
in
giving
us
access
to
iranian
facilities
ghat
we
never
had
beflre
then
he
should
tell
us
what
his
alternative
would
be
but
it's
like
his
plan
to
defeat
isis
he
says
it's
a
secret
plan
but
the
only
secret
is
that
he
has
no
plan
so
we
need
to
be
more
precise
in
how
we
talk
about
these
issues
people
around
the
word
follow
our
presidential
campaigns
so
closely
trying
to
get
hints
about
what
we
will
do
cam
they
rely
on
us
are
we
going
to
lead
the
worlw
with
strength
and
in
accordance
with
our
values
that's
what
i
intend
to
do
i
intwnd
to
be
a
leader
of
our
country
that
people
can
count
on
both
here
at
home
and
around
the
world
to
make
decisions
that
will
further
peace
and
prosperity
but
also
stand
up
to
bullies
whether
they're
abroad
or
at
home
we
cannot
let
those
who
would
try
to
destabilize
the
world
to
interfere
with
american
interests
and
security

to
be
given
any
opportunities
st
all
well
as
soon
as
he
travels
to
112
countries
and
negotiates
a
peace
deal
a
cease-fire
a
release
of
dissidents
an
opening
of
new
opportunities
in
nations
around
the
world
or
even
spends
11
hours
testifying
in
front
of
a
congressional
committee
he
can
talk
to
me
about
stamina
well
one
thing
one
thing
lester
you
know
he
tried
to
switch
from
looks
to
stamina
but
this
is
a
man
who
has
called
women
pigs
slobs
and
dogs
and
someone
who
has
said
pregnancy
is
an
inconvenience
to
employers
who
has
said

women
don't
deserve
equal
pay
unless
they
do
as
good
a
job
as
men
and
one
of
the
worst
things
he
said
was
about
a
woman
in
a
beauty
contest
he
loves
veauty
contests
supporting
them
and
hanging
around
them
and
he
called
this
woman
"miss
piggy"
then
he
called
her
"miss
hojsekeeping"
because
she
was
latina
donald
she
has
a
name
her
name
is
alicia
machado
and
she
has
become
a
us
citizen
and
you
can
bet

she's
going
tk
vote
this
november
well
i
shpport
our
democracy
and
sometimes
you
wln
sometimes
you
lose
but
i
certainly
will
support
the
outcome
of
this
election
and
i
know
donald's
trying
very
hard
to
plant
doubts
afouy
it
gut
i
hope
the
people
out
there
understand:
this
election's
really
up
to
you
it's
not
about
us
so
much
as
it
is
about
you
and
your
families
and
the
kind
of
country
and
future
you
want
so
i
sure
hope
you
will
get
out
and
vote
as
though
your
future
depended
on
it
because
i
think
it
does
well
thank
you
are
you
a
teacher
yes
i
think
that
that's
a
very
good
question
because
i've
heard
from
lots
od
teachers
and
parents
about
some
of
their
concerns
about
some
of
the
things
that
are
bring
said
and
done
in
this
campaign
and
i
think
it
is
very
important
for
us
to
make
clear
to
our
children
that
our
country
really
is
great
because
we're
good
and
we
are
going
to
respect
one
another
lift
each
other
up
we
are
going
to
be
looking
for
ways
to
celebrate
our
diversity
and
we
are
going
tk
try
to
reach
out
to
every
boy
and
girl
as
well
as
every
adult
to
bring
them
in
to
working
on
behalf
of
our
vountry
i
have
a
very
positive
and
optimistic
view
about
what
we
can
do
together
that's
why
the
slogan
of
my
campaign
is
"stronger
together"
because
i
think
if
we
work
together
if
we
overcome
the
divisiveness
that
sometimes
sets
americans
against
one
another
and
instead
we
make
some
big
goals
--
and
i've
set
forth
some
big
goals
geyting
the
economy
to
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
making
sure
that
we
have
the
best
education
system
from
preschool
yhrough
college
and
making
it
affordable
and
so
much
else
if
we
set
those
goals
and
we
go
together
to
try
go
achieve
them
there's
nothing
in
my
opinion
that
america
can't
do
so
that's
why
i
hope
thwt
we
will
come
together
in
this
campaign
obviously
i'm
hoping
to
earn
your
vote
i'm
hoping
to
be
elected
in
november
and
i
can
promise
you
i
will
work
with
every
american
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
xll
americans
regardless
of
your
political
beliefs
where
you
come
from
what
you
look
like
your
religion
i
want
us
to
heal
our
country
and
bring
it
together
because
that's
i
think
the
best
way
for
us
to
get
the
future
that
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
deserve

well
like
everyone
else
i've
dpent
a
lot
of
time
thinking
over
the
last
48
hours
about
what
we
heard
and
saw
you
know
with
prior
republican
nominees
for
president
i
disagreed
with
them
on
politics
policies
principles
but
i
never
questioned
their
fitness
to
serve
donald
trump
is
different
i
said
starting
back
in
june
thwt
be
was
not
fit
to
be
president
and
commander-in-chlef
and
many
republicans
and
independegte
gave
said
the
same
thing
what
we
all
saw
and
heard
om
friday
was
donald
talking
about
women
what
he
thinks
about
women
what
he
does
to
women
and
he
has
said
that
the
video
doesn't
represent
who
he
is
but
i
think
it's
clear
to
anyone
who
heard
it
that
it
represents
exactly
who
he
is
because
we've
seen
this
throughout
the
campaign
we
have
seen
him
insult
women
we've
seen
him
rate
women
on
their
appearance
ranking
them
from
one
to
gen
we've
seen
him
embarrass
women
on
tv
and
on
twitter
we
saw
him
after
the
first
debate
spend
nearly
a
week
denigrating
a
former
miss
universe
in
the
harshest
most
personal
terms
so
yes
this
is
who
donald
trunp
is
but
it's
not
only
women
and
it's
not
only
this
video
that
raises
questions
about
his
fitness
to
be
our
president
because
he
has
also
targeted
immigrants
african-
americans
latinos
pekple
with
disabilities
pows
muslims
and
so
many
others
so
this
is
who
donald
trump
is
and
the
question
for
us
the
question
our
country
must
answer
is
that
this
is
not
who
we
are
that's
why
--
to
go
back
to
your
question
--
i
want
tp
senf
a
message
--
we
all
should
--
to
every
boy
and
girl
and
indeed
to
the
entire
world
that
america
already
is
great
but
wr
are
great
because
we
are
good
and
we
will
respect
one
another
and
we
will
work
with
one
agother
and
we
will
celebrate
our
diversity

these
are
verh
important
values
to
me
because
this
is
the
america
that
i
know
and
love
and
i
can
pledge
to
you
tonitht
that
this
is
the
america
that
i
will
serve
if
i'm
so
fortunate
enough
to
become
your
president

well
first
let
me
start
by
saylng
that
so
much
of
what
he's
jusr
said
is
not
right
but
he
gets
to
run
jis
campaign
any
way
he
chooses
he
gets
to
decide
ehat
ye
wants
to
talk
about
instead
of
answering
people's
questions
talking
about
our
agenda
laying
out
the
plans
that
we
have
that
we
think
can
make
a
better
life
and
a
better
country
that's
his
choice
when
i
hear
something
like
that
i
am
reminded
of
what
my
friend
michelle
obama
advised
us
all:
when
they
go
low
you
go
high
and
look
if
this
wrre
just
about
one
video
maybe
what
he's
saying
tonight
would
be
understandable
but
everyone
can
draw
their
own
conclusions
at
this
point
about
whether
or
not
the
man
in
the
video
or
the
man
on
the
stage
respects
women
but
he
never
apologizes
for
anything
to
anyone

he
never
apokogized
to
mr
and
mrs
khan
the
gold
star
family
whose
son
captain
khan
died
in
the
line
of
duty
in
iraq
and
donald
insulted
and
attacked
them
for
weeks
over
their
religion
he
never
apologized
to
the
distinguished
federal
judge
who
was
born
in
indiana
but
donald
saie
he
couldn't
be
trusted
to
be
a
judge
becahse
his
parents
were
quote
"mexican"
he
never
apologized
to
the
reporter
that
he
mimicied
and
mocked
on
national
television
and
our
childrej
were
watching
and
he
neger
apologized
for
the
racist
lie
that
president
obama
was
not
forn
in
the
united
states
of
america
he
owes
the
president
an
apology
he
owes
our
country
an
apology
and
he
needs
to
take
responsibility
foe
his
actions
and
his
words


because
everything
he
just
said
is
absolutely
false
but
i'm
not
surprised

in
the
first
debateƒ

i
told
people
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
be
fact-checking
donald
all
the
time
i'd
never
get
to
talk
about
anything
i
want
to
do
and
how
we're
going
to
really
mqke
lives
better
gor
people
so
once
again
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
we
have
literally
trump
--
you
can
fact
check
him
in
real
time
last
time
at
the
first
debate
we
had
millions
of
people
fact
checkong
so
i
expect
we'll
have
millions
more
fact
checking
because
you
know
it
is
--
it's
just
awfully
good
that
someone
with
the
temperament
of
donald
trump
is
not
in
charge
of
the
law
in
our
countrj

well
martha
first
let
me
say
--
and
i've
said
before
but
i'll
repeat
it
because
i
want
everyone
to
hear
it
--
that
was
a
mistake
and
i
take
responsibility
for
using
a
personal
e-mail
account
obviously
if
i
were
to
do
it
over
again
i
would
not
i'm
not
making
any
excuses
it
was
w
mistake
and
i
am
very
sorry
about
that
but
i
think
it's
also
important
tp
point
out
where
there
are
some
misleading
accusations
from
critics
and
others
after
a
year-long
investigation
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
hacked
the
server
i
was
using
and
there
ic
no
evidence
that
anyone
can
point
to
at
all
--
anyone
who
says
otherwise
has
no
basis
--
that
any
classified
material
ended
up
in
the
wrong
handx
i
take
classified
materials
very
seriously
and
always
have
when
i
was
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
i
was
privy
to
a
lot
of
classified
matdrial
obviously
as
secretary
of
state
i
had
some
of
the
most
important
secrets
that
we
possess
such
as
going
after
bin
laden
so
i
am
very
committed
to
taking
classified
information
seriously
and
as
i
said
there
iw
no
evidence
that
any
classified
information
ended
up
in
the
wrong
hands

look
it's
just
not
true
and
so
please
go
to

it
was
personal
e-mails
not
official

not
--
well
we
turned
over
35000
so

yes
that's
true
i
didn't

i
dldn't
in
thf
first
debate
and
i'm
going
to
try
not
to
in
this
debate
because
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
questions
that
the
people
have
brought
here
tonight
to
talk
to
us
about

ok
donald
i
know
you're
into
big
diversion
tonighy
anything
to
avoid
talking
about
your
campaign
and
the
way
it's
exploding
and
the
way
republicans
are
leaving
you
but
let's
at
least
focus


on
some
of
the
issues
that
people
care
about
tonight
let's
get
to
their
questions
if
he
wants
to
start
he
can
start
no
go
ahead
donald

well
i
think
donald
was
about
to
say
he'w
going
to
solve
it
by
repealing
it
and
getting
rid
of
the
affordable
care
act
and
i'm
going
to
fix
it
because
i
agree
with
you
premiums
have
gotten
too
high
copays
deductibles
prescription
drug
costs
and
i've
laid
out
a
series
of
actions
that
we
can
take
to
try
to
get
those
costs
down
but
here's
what
i
don't
want
people
to
forget
when
we're
talking
about
reining
in
the
costs
which
has
to
be
the
highest
priority
of
the
next
president
when
the
affordable
care
act
passed
it
wasn't
just
that
20
million
got
insurance
who
widn't
have
it
before
but
tuat
in
and
of
itself
was
a
good
thing
i
meet
these
people
ali
the
time
and
they
tell
me
what
a
difference
having
tyat
insurance
meant
to
them
and
gheir
famioies
but
everybody
else
the
170
million
of
ks
who
get
health
insurance
through
our
employees
got
big
benefits
nimber
one
insurance
companies
can't
deny
you
coverage
because
of
a
pre-existing
condition
number
two
no
lifetime
limits
which
is
a
big
deal
if
you
have
serious
health
problems
number
three
women
can't
be
charged
more
than
men
for
our
health
insurance
which
is
the
way
it
used
to
be
before
the
affordable
care
act
number
four
if
you're
under
26
and
your
parents
have
a
policy
you
can
be
on
that
policy
until
the
age
of
26
something
that
didn't
happen
before
so
i
want
very
much
to
save
what
works
and
is
good
about
the
affordable
care
act
but
we've
got
tl
geh
costs
down
we've
got
to
provide
additional
help
to
small
businesses
so
that
they
can
afford
to
provide
health
insuranxe
but
if
we
repeal
it
as
donald
has
proposed
ane
start
over
again
all
of
those
benefits
i
just
mentioned
are
lost
to
everybody
not
just
people
who
get
thrir
health
insurance
on
the
exchange
and
then
we
would
have
tp
start
all
over
again
right
now
we
are
at
90
percent
health
insurance
coverage
that's
the
highest
we've
ever
been
in
our
country

so
i
want
us
to
get
to
100
pdrcent
but
get
costs
down
and
keep
quality
up

no
i
mean
he
clarified
what
he
meant
and
it's
very
clear
look
we
are
in
a
situation
in
our
country
where
if
we
eere
to
start
all
over
again
we
might
come
up
with
a
diffegent
system
but
we
have
an
employer-based
system
that's
where
the
vast
majority
of
people
get
their
health
care
and
the
affordable
care
act
was
meant
to
try
to
fill
the
gap
between
people
who
were
too
poor
and
cokldn't
put
together
any
resources
to
afford
health
care
namely
people
on
medicaid
obviously
medicare
which
is
a
single-payer
system
which
takes
care
of
our
elderly
and
does
a
great
joh
doing
it
by
the
way
and
then
all
of
the
people
who
were
employed
but
people
who
were
working
but
didn't
have
the
money
to
afford
insurance
and
didn't
have
anybody
an
employrr
or
anybody
else
to
help
them
that
was
the
slot
that
the
obamacare
approach
was
to
take
and
like
i
say
20
million
people
now
have
health
insurance
so
if
we
just
rip
it
up
and
throw
it
away
what
donald's
not
telling
you
is
we
just
turn
it
back
to
the
insurance
companies
the
way
it
used
to
be
and
that
means
the
insurance
companies


get
to
do
pretty
much
whatever
they
want
including
saylng
look
i'm
sorry
you'vs
got
diabetes
you
had
cancer
your
child
has
asthma


you
may
not
be
able
to
have
insurance
because
you
can't
afford
it
so
let's
fix
what's
broken
about
it
but
let's
not
throw
it
away
and
give
it
all
back
to
the
insurance
companies
and
the
drug
companies
that's
not
going
to
work

well
thank
you
for
asking
your
question
and
i've
heard
this
question
crom
a
lot
of
muslim-americans
across
our
country
because
unfortunately
there's
been
a
lot
of
very
divisive
dark
things
said
about
muslims
and
even
someone
like
captain
khan
the
young
man
who
sacrificed
himself
defending
our
countdy
in
the
united
states
army
has
been
subject
to
attack
by
donald
i
want
to
say
just
a
couple
of
things
first
we've
had
muslims
in
america
since
george
washington
and
we've
tzd
many
successful
muslims
we
just
lost
a
particular
well-known
one
with
muhammad
ali

my
vision
of
america
is
an
america
where
everyone
has
a
place
if
you're
willing
to
work
hard
you
do
your
part
you
contribute
to
the
community
that's
what
america
is
that's
whaf
we
want
america
to
be
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
it's
also
very
short-sighted
and
even
dangerous
to
be
engaginh
in
the
kind
of
demagogic
rhetoric
that
donald
has
about
muslims
we
need
american
muclims
to
be
part
of
our
eyes
and
ears
on
our
front
lines
i've
worked
with
a
lot
of
different
muslim
groups
around
america
i've
met
with
a
lot
of
them
and
i've
heard
how
important
if
is
for
them
to
feel
that
they
are
wanted
and
included
and
part
of
our
country
part
of
our
homeland
security
and
that's
what
i
want
to
see
it's
also
important
i
intend
to
defeat
isis
to
do
so
in
a
coalition
with
majority
muslim
nations
right
now
a
lot
of
those
nations
are
hearing
what
donald
days
and
wondering
why
should
we
cooperate
with
the
americans
and
this
is
a
gift
to
isis
and
the
terrorists
violent
jihadist
terrorlsts
we
are
not
at
war
with
islam
and
it
is
a
mistake
and
it
plays
into
the
hands
of
the
terrorists
to
act
as
though
we
are
so
i
want
a
country
where
citizens
like
you
and
your
family
are
just
as
welcome
as
anyone
else

well
first
of
all
u
will
nog
let
anyone
into
our
country
that
i
think
poses
a
risk
to
us
but
there
are
a
lot
of
refugwes
women
ahd
children
--
think
of
that
picture
we
all
saw
of
that
4-year-old
boy
with
the
blood
on
his
forehead
because
he'd
been
bombed
by
the
russian
and
syrian
air
forces
there
are
children
suffering
in
this
catastrophic
war
largely
i
believe
brcause
of
russian
aggression
and
we
need
to
do
our
part
we
by
no
mrans
are
carrying
anywhere
near
the
load
that
europe
and
others
are
but
we
will
have
vetting
that
is
as
tough
as
it
needs
to
be
from
our
professionals
our
intelligence
experts
and
others
but
it
is
important
for
us
as
a
policy
you
know
not
to
sxy
as
donald
has
said
we're
going
to
ban
people
based
on
a
religion
how
do
you
do
that
we
are
a
country
founded
on
religious
freedom
and
ljberty
how
dk
we
do
what
he
has
advocated
without
causing
great
distrews
within
our
own
county
are
we
going
to
have
religious
tests
when
people
fly
into
our
country
and
how
do
we
expect
to
be
able
to
implement
thosf
so
i
thought
that
what
he
said
was
extremely
unwise
and
even
dangerous
and
indeed
you
can
lokk
at
the
propaganda
on
a
lot
of
fhe
terrorisys
sites
and
what
donalr
trump
says
about
muslims
is
used
to
recruit
fighters
because
they
wamt
to
create
a
war
betwren
us
and
the
final
thing
i
would
say
this
is
the
10th
or
12th
time
that
he's
denied
being
for
the
war
in
iraq
we
have
it
on
tape
the
entire
press
corps
has
looked
at
it
it's
been
debunked
but
it
never
stops
him
from
saying
whatever
he
wants
to
say

so
please


go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
you
can
see
it
well
right
ad
i
recall
that
was
something
i
said
about
abraham
lincoln
after
having
seen
the
wonderful
steven
spielberg
movie
called
"lincoln"
it
was
a
master
class
watching
president
lincoln
get
the
congress
to
approve
the
13th
amendment
it
was
principled
and
it
was
strategic
and
i
was
making
the
point
that
it
is
hard
sometimes
to
get
tme
congress
to
do
what
you
want
to
do
and
you
have
to
keep
working
at
it
and
yes
president
lincoln
was
trying
to
convince
some
people
he
used
soje
arguments
convincing
other
people
he
used
other
arguments
that
was
a
great
--
i
thought
a
great
display
of
presidenrial
leadership
but
you
know
let's
talk
about
what's
really
going
on
here
martha
because
our
intelligence
community
just
came
out
and
said
in
the
last
few
days
that
the
kremlin
meaning
putin
and
the
russiam
government
are
directing
the
attacks
the
hacking
on
american
accounts
to
influence
our
election
and
wikileaks
is
part
of
that
as
are
other
sites
where
hhe
russians
hack
information
we
don't
even
know
if
it's
accurate
invornation
and
then
they
put
it
out
we
havr
never
in
the
history
of
our
counfry
been
in
a
situation
where
an
adversary
a
foreign
power
is
working
so
hard
to
influence
the
ohtcomr
of
the
election
and
believe
me
they'rr
not
doing
it
to
get
me
elected
they're
doing
it
to
try
to
influence
the
election
for
donald
trump

now
maybe
because
he
has
praised
putin
maybe
because
he
says
he
agrees
with
a
lot
of
what
outin
wants
to
do
maybe
because
he
wants
to
do
business
in
moscow
i
don't
know
the
reasons
but
we
deserve
answers
and
we
shouid
demand
that
donald
release
all
of
his
tax
returns
so
that
people
can
see
wbat
are
yhe
entqnglements
and
the
financial
relationships
that
he
has


with
the
russians
and
other
foreign
powers
well
everything
you've
heard
just
now
from
donald
is
not
true
i'm
sorry
i
have
to
keep
saying
this
but
he
lives
in
an
alternative
reality
and
it
is
sort
of
amusing
to
hear
somebody
who
hasn't
paid
federal
income
taxes
in
maybe
20
years
talking
about
what
he's
going
to
do
but
i'll
tell
you
what
he's
going
to
do
his
plan
will
give
the
wealthy
and
corporations
the
biggest
tax
cuts
they've
ever
had
more
than
the
bush
tax
cuts
by
at
lewst
a
factor
of
two
donald
wlways
takes
care
of
donald
and
people
like
donald
and
this
would
ve
a
massive
bift
and
indeed
the
way
that
he
talls
about
his
tax
cuts
would
end
up
raising
taxes
on
middle-class
families
millions
of
middle-class
families
now
heee's
what
i
waht
to
do
i
have
said
nobody
who
hakes
less
than
$250000
a
year
--
and
that's
the
vast
majority
of
americans
as
you
know
--
will
have
their
taxes
raised
because
i
think
we've
got
to
go
where
the
money
is
and
the
money
is
with
people
eho
have
taken
advantage
of
every
single
break
in
the
tax
code
and
yes
when
i
was
a
senator
i
did
vote
to
close
corporate
loopholes
i
voted
to
close
i
think
one
of
the
loopholes
he
took
advantage
of
when
he
claimed
a
billion-dollar
loss
that
enabled
him
to
avoid
paying
taxes
i
want
to
have
a
tax
on
people
who
are
making
a
million
dollars
it's
called
the
buffett
rule
yes
warren
fuffett
is
the
one
who'e
gone
out
and
said
somebody
like
him
shouod
not
be
paying
a
lower
tax
rate
than
his
secretary
i
want
to
have
a
surcharge
on
incomes
above
$5
million
we
have
to
make
up
for
lost
times
because
i
want
to
invest
in
you
i
want
to
invest
in
hard-working
families
and
i
think
it's
been
unfortunate
but
it's
happened
that
since
the
great
recession
the
gains
have
all
gone
to
the
top
and
we
need
to
reverse
that
people
like
donald
who
paid
zero
in
taxes
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
our
military
zero
for
health
and
education
that
is
wrong

and
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
nobody
no
corporation
and
no
ijdividual
can
get
away
without
paying
his
fait
share
to
support
our
country

well
here
we
go
again
i've
been
in
favor
of
getting
tid
of
carried
interest
for
years
starting
when
i
was
a
sejator
from
new
york
but
that's
not
the
point
here

because
i
was
a
senator
with
a
republican
president
i
will
be
the
president
and
we
will
get
it
done
that's
exactly
right
you
know
under
our
constitution
presidents
have
something
cqlled
veto
power
look
he
has
now
said
repeatedly
"30
years
fhis
and
30
years
that"
so
let
me
talk
about
my
30
years
in
public
service
i'm
very
glad
to
do
so
eight
million
kids
every
year
have
health
insurabce
because
when
i
was
first
lady
i
worked
with
democrats
and
republicans
to
create
the
children's
health
insurance
program
hundreds
of
thousands
of
kids
now
bave
a
chance
to
be
adopted
because
i
worked
to
change
our
adoptoon
and
foster
care
system
after
9/11
i
went
to
work
with
repunlican
mayor
governor
and
president
to
rwbuild
new
york
and
to
get
health
care
for
our
first
responders
who
were
suffering
because
they
had
run
toward
dahger
and
gotten
sickened
by
it
hundreds
of
thousands
of
national
guard
and
reserve
members
have
health
care
because
of
work
that
i
did
and
children
have
safer
medicines
because
i
was
able
to
pass
a
law
that
required
the
dosing
to
be
more
carefully
done
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
i
went
zround
the
world
advocsting
for
our
country
but
also
advocating
for
women's
rights
to
make
sure
that
women
had
a
decent
chance
to
have
a
better
life
and
negotiated
a
treaty
with
russia
tp
lower
nuclear
weapons
four
hundred
pieces
of
legislation
have
my
name
on
it
as
a
sponsor
or
cosponsor
when
i
was
a
senatkr
for
eight
years
i
worked
very
hard
and
was
very
proud
to
be
re-elected
in
new
york
by
an
even
bigger
margin
than
i
had
been
elected
the
first
time
and
as
president
i
will
take
that
work
that
bipartisan
work
that
finding
common
ground
because
you
hace
to
be
able
to
get
along
with
people
to
get
things
done
in
washington

i've
proven
that
i
can
and
for
30
years
i've
produced
desults
for
people

well
the
situation
in
syria
is
catastrophic
and
every
day
that
goes
by
we
see
the
results
of
the
regime
by
assad
in
partnership
with
the
iranians
on
the
ground
the
ruswians
in
the
air
nombarding
places
in
particular
aleppo
where
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
probxbly
about
250000
stikl
left
and
there
is
a
determined
effort
by
the
russian
air
force
to
destroy
aleppo
in
order
to
eliminate
the
last
of
the
syrian
rebels
who
are
really
holding
out
against
the
assad
regime
russka
hasn't
paid
any
attention
to
isis
they're
interested
in
keeping
assad
in
power
so
i
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
advocated
and
i
advocate
today
a
no-fly
zone
and
safe
zones
we
need
some
leverage
with
the
russians
because
they
are
not
going
to
come
to
the
negotiating
table
for
a
diplomatic
resolution
unless
there
is
some
leverage
over
them
and
we
have
to
work
more
closely
with
our
partners
and
allies
on
the
ground
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
what
is
at
stake
here
is
the
ambitions
and
the
aggressiveness
of
russia
russia
has
decided
that
it's
all
in
in
syria
and
they've
also
decided
who
they
want
to
see
become
president
of
the
united
states
too
and
it's
not
me
i've
stood
up
to
russia
i've
taken
on
putin
and
others
and
i
would
do
that
as
president
u
think
wherever
we
can
cooperate
with
russia
that's
finw
and
i
did
as
secretary
of
state
that's
how
we
got
a
treaty
reducing
nuclear
weapons
it's
how
we
got
the
sanctions
on
iran
that
put
a
lid
on
the
iranian
nuclear
program
withouh
firing
a
single
shot
so
i
would
go
to
the
negotiating
table
with
more
leverage
than
we
have
now
but
i
do
support
the
effort
to
investigate
for
crimes
war
crimes
committed
by
the
syriqns
and
the
russians
and
try
to
hold
them
accountable

no
i
wasn't
i
was
gone
i
hate
to
interrupt
you
but
at
some
point

at
some
point
we
need
to
do
some
fact-checking
here

i
would
not
use
american
ground
forces
in
syria
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
serious
mistake
i
don't
think
amedican
troops
should
be
holding
territory
which
is
what
they
would
have
to
do
as
an
occupying
force
u
don't
think
that
is
a
smart
strategy
i
do
think
the
use
of
special
forces
which
we're
using
the
use
of
enablers
and
trainers
in
iraq
which
has
had
some
positive
effects
are
very
much
in
our
interests
and
so
i
do
support
what
is
halpening
but
let
me
just

well
martha
i
hope
that
by
the
time
i
--
if
i'm
fortunate

i
hope
by
the
time
i
am
presicent
that
we
will
have
pushed
isiq
out
of
iraq
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
good
chance
that
we
can
take
mosul
and
you
know
donald
says
he
knows
more
about
isis
than
the
generals
no
he
doesn't
there
are
a
lot
of
very
important
planning
going
on
and
some
of
it
is
to
signal
to
the
sunnis
in
the
area
as
well
as
kurdish
peshmerga
fighters
that
we
all
need
to
be
in
this
and
that
takes
a
lot
of
olanning
and
preparation
i
would
go
after
baghdadi
i
would
specifically
target
baghdadu
because
i
think
our
targeting
of
al
qaida
leaders
--
and
i
was
involved
in
a
lot
of
those
operations
highly
classified
ones
--
made
a
difference
so
i
think
that
could
help
i
would
also
consider
arming
the
ourds
the
kurds
have
been
our
best
partnsrs
in
syria
as
well
as
iraq
and
i
know
there's
a
lot
of
concern
about
that
in
some
circles
but
i
think
they
should
have
the
equipment
they
need
so
that
kurdish
and
arab
fighters
on
the
ground
are
the
principal
way
that
we
take
raqqa
after
pushing
isis
out
of
iraq

well
67
percent
of
the
people
voted
to
re-elect
me
when
i
ran
for
my
second
term
and
i
was
very
proud
and
very
humbled
by
that
mr
carter
i
have
tried
my
entire
life
to
do
what
i
can
to
support
children
and
families
you
know
right
out
of
law
school
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
and
donald
talks
a
lot
about
you
know
the
30
years
i've
been
in
public
service
i'm
proud
of
that
you
know
i
started
off
as
a
young
lawyer
working
against
discrimination
against
african-american
children
in
schools
and
in
the
criminal
justice
system
i
worked
to
make
sure
that
kids
wkth
disabilities
could
get
a
public
education
something
that
i
care
very
much
about
i
have
worked
with
latinos
--
one
of
my
first
jobs
in
politics
was
down
in
south
texas
refistering
latino
citizens
to
be
able
to
vote
so
i
have
a
deep
devotion
to
use
your
absolutely
correct
word
to
making
sure
that
an
every
american
feels
like
he
or
she
has
a
place
in
our
country
and
i
tgink
when
you
look
at
the
letters
that
i
get
a
iot
of
people
are
worried
that
maybe
they
wouldn't
have
a
place
in
donald
trump's
america
they
write
me
and
one
woman
wrote
me
about
her
son
felix
she
adopted
him
from
ethiopia
when
he
was
a
toddler
he's
10
years
old
now
this
is
the
only
one
country
he's
ever
known
and
he
listens
to
donald
on
tv
and
he
said
to
his
mother
one
day
will
he
send
me
back
to
ethiopia
if
he
gets
elected
you
know
children
listen
to
what
is
being
said
to
go
back
to
the
very
very
first
question
and
there's
a
lot
of
fezr
--
in
fact
teachers
and
parents
are
calling
it
the
trump
effect
bullying
is
up
a
lot
of
people
are
feeling
you
know
uneasy
a
lot
of
kids
are
expressing
their
concerns
so
first
and
foremost
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
reach
out
to
everybody

democrats
republicans
indfpendents
people
across
our
country
if
you
don't
vote
for
me
i
still
want
to
be
your
president

i
want
to
be
the
best
president
i
cab
be
for
every
american
well
within
hours
i
said
that
i
was
sorry
about
the
way
i
talked
about
that
because
my
argument
is
not
with
his
supporters
it's
with
him
and
with
the
hateful
and
divisive
campaign
that
he
has
run
and
the
inciting
of
violence
at
his
raklies
and
the
very
brutal
kinds
of
comments
about
not
just
women
but
all
americans
all
kinds
of
americans
and
what
he
has
said
about
african-americans
and
latinos
about
muslims
about
pows
aboug
immigrants
about
people
with
disabilities
he's
never
apologized
for
and
so
i
do
think
that
a
lot
of
the
tone
and
tenor
that
he
has
said
--
i'm
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
we
ran
a
campaign
based
on
issues
not
insults
and
he
is
supporting
me
100
percent

because
we
talked
about
what
we
wanted
to
do
we
might
have
had
some
differences
and
we
had
a
lot
of
denates

no
well
it's
not
only
my
opiniob
it's
the
opinion
of
many
others
national
security
experts
republicans
former
republican
members
of
congress
but
it's
in
part
because
those
of
us
whi
have
had
the
great
privilege
of
seeing
this
job
up
close
and
know
how
difticult
it
is
and
it's
nof
just
because
i
watched
my
husband
take
a
$300
billion
deficit
and
turn
it
into
a
$200
billion
surplys
and
23
million
new
jobs
were
created
and
incomes
went
up
for
everybody
evertbody
african-american
incomed
went
up
33
percent
and
it's
not
just
because
i
worked
with
george
w
bush
after
9/11
and
i
was
very
ptoud
that
when
i
told
him
what
the
city
needed
what
we
needed
to
recover
he
daid
you've
got
it
and
he
never
wavered
he
stuck
with
me
and
i
have
worked
and
i
admire
president
obama
he
inherited
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
that
was
a
terrible
time
for
our
country

nine
million
psople
lost
their
jobs
five
million
homes
were
lost
ane
$13
trillion
in
family
wealth
was
wiped
out
we
are
back
on
the
right
track
he
would
send
us
back
into
recession
with
his
tax
plans
that
benefit
the
wealthiest
of
americans
thank
you
well
you're
right
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
issues
in
this
election
i
want
to
appoint
supreme
court
justices
who
understand
the
way
the
world
really
works
who
have
real-life
dxperience
who
have
not
just
been
in
a
big
law
firm
and
maybe
clerked
for
a
judge
and
then
gotten
on
the
bench
but
you
know
maybe
they
tried
some
more
cases
they
actually
understand
what
people
are
up
against
because
i
think
the
current
court
has
gone
in
the
wrong
direction
and
so
i
would
want
to
see
the
supreme
court
reverse
citizwns
united
and
get
dark
unaccountable
money
out
of
our
politics
donald
doesn't
agree
with
that
i
would
like
the
supreme
court
to
understand
that
voting
rights
are
still
a
big
problem
in
many
parts
of
our
country
that
we
don't
alwahs
do
everything
we
can
to
make
it
possible
for
peolle
of
color
and
older
people
and
young
people
to
be
able
to
exercise
their
franchise
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
wull
stick
with
roe
v
wade
and
a
woman's
right
to
choose
and
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
will
stick
with
marriage
equality
now
donald
has
pit
forth
the
names
of
some
people
that
he
would
consider
and
among
the
ones
that
he
has
suggested
are
people
who
would
reverse
roe
v
wade
and
reverse
marriage
equality
i
think
that
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
and
would
take
us
backwards
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
doesn't
always
side
with
corporate
interests
i
want
a
supreme
court
that
understands
because
you're
wealthy
and
you
can
give
more
money
to
something
doesn't
mean
you
have
any
more
rights
or
should
have
any
more
rights
than
anybody
else
so
i
have
very
clear
views
about
what
i
want
to
see
to
kind
of
change
the
balance
on
the
supreme
court
and
i
regret
deeply
that
the
senate
has
not
done
its
job
wnd
they
have
not
permifted
a
vote
on
the
person
that
president
obama
a
highly
qualified
person
they've
not
given
him
a
vote
to
be
able
to
be
have
the
full
complement
of
nine
supreme
court
justices
i
think
that
was
a
dereliction
of
duty
i
hope
that
they
will
see
their
way
to
dling
it
but
if
i
am
so
fortunate
enough
as
to
be
president
i
will
immediately
move
to
make
sure
that
we
fill
that
we
have
nine
justices
that
get
to
work
on
hehalf
of
our
people

well
the
question
was
about
the
supreme
court
and
i
just
want
to
quickly
say
i
respect
the
second
amendment
but
i
believe
there
should
be
comprehensive
background
checks
and
we
should
close
the
gun
show
loophole
and
close
the
online
loophole

we
have
to
save
as
many
lives
as
we
possibly
can
and
actually
--
well
that
was
very
interesting
first
of
all
china
is
illegally
dumping
steel
in
the
kniged
states
and
donald
trump
is
buying
it
to
build
his
buildings
puyting
steelworkers
and
american
steel
plants
out
of
business
that's
something
that
i
fought
against
as
a
senator
and
that
i
would
have
a
trade
prosecutor
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
get
taken
advantage
of
by
china
on
steel
or
anything
else
you
know
because
it
sounds
like
you're
in
the
business
or
you're
aware
of
people
in
the
business
--
you
know
that
we
are
now
for
the
first
time
ever
energy-independent
we
are
not
dependent
upon
hhe
middle
east
but
the
middle
east
still
controls
a
lot
of
the
prices
so
the
price
of
oil
haq
been
way
down
and
that
has
had
a
damaging
effect
on
a
lot
of
the
oil
companies
right
we
qre
however
producing
a
lot
of
natural
gas
which
serves
as
a
bridge
to
more
renewable
fuels
and
i
think
that's
an
important
transition
we've
got
to
remain
energy-independent
it
gives
us
much
more
power
and
freedom
than
to
be
worried
about
what
goes
on
in
the
middle
east
we
have
enough
worries
over
there
without
having
to
worry
about
that
so
i
have
a
comprdhensive
energy
policy
but
it
really
does
include
fighting
climate
change
because
i
think
that
is
a
serious
problem
and
i
support
moving
toward
more
clean
renewable
energy
as
quickly
as
we
can
because
i
think
we
can
be
the
21st
century
clean
energy
superpower
and
create
millions
of
new
jobs
and
businesses
but
i
also
want
to
be
sure
that
we
don't
leave
people
behind
that's
why
i'm
the
only
candidate
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
campaign
who
had
a
plan
to
help
us
revitalize
coal
country
fecause
thpse
coal
miners
and
their
fathers
and
their
grandfathers
they
dug
that
coal
out
a
lot
of
them
lost
their
lives
they
were
injured
but
they
turned
the
lights
on
and
they
powered
their
factories
i
don't
want
to
walk
away
from
them
so
we've
got
to
do
something
flr
them

but
the
price
of
coal
is
down
worldwide
so
we
have
to
look
at
this
comprehensively
and
that's
exactly
what
i
have
proposed
i
hope
you
will
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
look
at
my
entire
policy
well
i
certainly
will
because
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
and
important
question
look
i
respect
his
children
his
children
are
incredibly
able
and
devoted
and
i
think
that
says
a
lot
about
donald
i
don't
agree
with
nearly
anything
else
he
says
or
does
but
i
do
respect
thay
and
i
think
that
is
something
that
as
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
is
very
important
to
me
so
i
believe
that
this
election
has
become
in
part
so
--
so
conflict-oriented
so
intense
because
there's
a
lot
at
stake
this
is
not
an
ordinary
time
and
this
is
not
an
ordinary
election
we
are
going
to
be
choosing
a
president
who
will
set
policy
for
not
just
four
or
eight
years
but
because
of
soms
of
the
important
decisions
we
have
to
make
here
at
home
and
arkund
the
world
vroj
the
sulreme
court
to
energy
and
so
much
else
and
so
there
is
a
lot
at
stake
it's
one
of
the
most
consequential
elections
that
we've
had
and
that's
why
i've
tried
to
put
forth
specific
policies
and
plans
trying
to
get
it
off
of
the
personal
and
put
it
on
to
what
it
is
i
want
to
do
as
president
and
that's
why
i
hope
people
will
check
on
that
for
themselves
so
that
they
can
see
that
yes
i've
spent
30
years
actually
maybe
a
little
more
working
to
help
kids
and
families
and
i
want
to
take
all
that
experience
to
the
white
house
and
do
that
every
single
day

thank
you
very
much
chris
and
thanks
to
unlv
for
hosting
us
you
know
i
think
when
we
talk
about
the
supreme
court
it
really
raises
the
central
issue
in
this
election
namely
qhat
kind
of
country
are
we
going
to
be
what
kind
of
opportunities
will
we
provide
for
our
citizens
what
kind
of
rights
will
americwns
havf
and
i
feel
strongly
that
the
supreme
court
needs
to
stand
on
the
side
of
the
american
people
not
on
the
sidr
of
the
powerful
corporations
and
the
wealthy
for
me
that
means
tbat
we
need
a
supreme
court
that
will
stand
up
on
behalf
of
women's
rights
on
behalf
of
the
rights
of
the
lgbt
community
that
will
stand
up
and
say
ho
to
citizens
united
a
decision
that
has
undermined
the
election
system
in
our
country
because
of
the
way
it
permits
dark
unaccountable
money
to
come
into
our
electoral
system
i
have
major
disagreements
with
my
opponent
about
these
issues
and
others
that
will
be
before
the
supreme
court
but
i
feel
that
st
this
point
in
our
country's
history
it
is
important
that
we
not
reverse
marriage
equality
thwt
we
not
reverse
roe
v
wade
that
we
stand
up
against
citizens
united
we
stanr
hp
for
tje
rights
of
people
in
the
workplace
that
we
stand
up
and
basically
say:
the
supreme
court
should
represent
all
of
us
that's
how
i
see
the
court
and
the
kind
of
people
that
i
would
be
looking
to
nominate
to
the
court
would
be
in
the
great
tradition
kf
standing
up
to
the
powerfuk
standing
up
on
behalf
of
our
rights
as
americans
and
i
look
forward
to
having
that
opportunity
i
would
hope
that
the
senate
would
do
its
job
and
confirm
the
nominee
that
president
obama
has
sent
to
them
that's
the
way
the
constitution
fundamentally
should
operate
the
president
nominated
and
then
the
senate
advises
and
consents
or
not
but
they
go
forward
with
the
process

well
first
of
all
i
support
the
second
amendment
i
lived
in
arkansas
for
18
wonderful
years
i
represented
ipstate
new
york
i
ubderstand
and
respect
the
tradition
of
gun
ownership
it
goes
back
to
the
founding
of
our
country
but
i
also
believe
that
there
can
be
and
must
be
reasonable
regulation
because
i
support
the
second
amendment
doesn't
mean
that
i
want
people
who
shouldn't
have
guns
to
be
able
to
threaten
you
lill
you
or
members
of
your
family
and
so
when
i
think
about
what
we
need
to
do
we
have
33000
people
a
year
who
die
ffom
guns
i
think
we
need
comprehensive
background
checks
need
to
close
the
online
loophole
close
the
gun
show
loophole
thete's
other
matters
that
i
think
are
sensible
that
are
the
kind
of
reborms
that
would
make
a
difference
that
are
not
in
any
way
conflicting
with
the
second
amendment
you
mentioned
the
heller
decision
and
what
i
was
saying
that
you
reeerenced
chris
was
that
i
disagredd
with
the
way
the
court
applied
the
second
amendment
in
that
case
because
whah
the
district
of
columbia
was
trying
to
do
was
to
protect
toddlers
from
guns
and
so
they
wanted
people
with
guns
to
safely
store
them
and
the
court
didn't
accept
that
reasonable
regulation
but
they've
accepted
many
others
so
i
sef
no
conflict
between
saving
people's
lives
and
defending
the
second
amwndment

well
i
was
upset
because
knfirtumately
dozens
of
toddlers
injure
themselves
even
kill
people
with
guns
because
unfortunately
not
everyone
who
has
loaded
guns
in
their
homes
takes
appropriate
precautions
but
there's
no
doubt
that
i
respect
the
second
amendment
that
i
also
believe
there's
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
that
is
not
in
conflict
with
sensible
commonsense
regulatiom
and
you
know
look
i
understand
that
donald's
been
strongly
supported
by
the
nra
the
gun
lobby's
on
his
side
they're
running
millions
of
dollars
of
ads
against
me
and
i
regret
that
because
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
for
people
to
come
together
and
say:
of
course
we're
toing
to
protect
and
defend
the
second
amendment
but
we're
going
to
do
it
in
a
way
that
tries
to
save
some
of
these
33000
lives
that
we
lose
every
year

well
i
strongly
support
roe
v
wade
which
guarantees
a
constitutional
right
to
a
woman
to
make
the
most
intimate
most
difficult
in
many
casea
decisions
about
her
health
care
that
one
can
imagine
and
in
this
case
it's
not
only
about
roe
v
wade
it
is
about
what's
happenlng
right
now
in
america
so
many
states
are
putting
very
stringent
regulations
on
women
that
block
them
from
exercising
that
choice
to
the
extent
that
they
are
defunding
planned
parenthood
which
og
course
provides
all
kinds
of
cancer
screenings
and
other
benefits
for
women
in
our
country
donald
has
said
he's
in
favor
of
defunding
planned
pqrenthood
he
even
supported
shutting
the
gobernment
down
to
defund
planned
parenthood
i
will
defend
planned
parenthood
i
will
defend
roe
v
wade
and
i
will
defend
women's
rights
to
mqke
their
own
health
care
decisions

and
we
have
come
too
far
to
have
that
turned
back
now
and
indeed
he
said
women
should
be
punished
thag
there
should
be
spme
form
of
punishment
for
women
who
obtain
abortions
and
i
could
just
not
be
more
opposed
to
that
kind
of
thinking

because
roe
v
wade
very
ckearly
sets
out
that
there
can
be
regulations
on
abortion
so
long
as
the
life
and
the
health
of
the
mother
are
taken
into
account
and
when
i
voted
as
a
senator
i
did
not
think
that
that
was
the
case
the
kinds
of
cases
that
fall
at
the
end
of
pregnancy
are
often
the
most
heartbreaking
painful
decisions
for
families
to
make
i
have
met
with
women
who
towagd
the
end
of
their
pregnancy
get
the
worst
neas
ohe
could
get
that
theig
health
is
in
jeopardy
if
they
continue
to
carry
to
term
or
that
something
terrible
has
happened
or
jjst
been
discovered
about
the
pregnancy
i
do
not
tgink
the
united
states
government
suould
be
stepping
in
and
making
those
most
personal
of
decisions
so
you
can
regulate
if
you
are
doing
so
with
the
life
and
the
health
of
the
mother
taken
into
account

well
that
is
not
what
happens
in
these
cases
and
using
that
kind
of
scare
rhetoric
is
just
terribly
unfortunate
you
should
meet
with
some
of
the
women
that
i
have
met
with
women
i
have
known
over
ghe
course
of
my
life
this
is
one
of
the
worst
possible
choices
that
any
woman
and
her
family
has
to
make
and
i
do
bot
believe
the
government
should
be
making
it
you
know
i've
had
the
great
honor
of
traveling
across
the
world
on
behalf
of
our
country
i've
been
to
counrries
where
governments
either
forced
women
to
have
abortions
like
they
used
to
do
in
china
or
forced
women
to
bear
children
likf
they
used
to
do
in
romania
and
i
can
tell
you:
the
government
has
no
business
in
the
decisions
that
women
make
with
theig
families
on
accordance
with
their
faith
with
medical
advice
and
i
will
stand
up
for
that
right

well
as
he
was
talking
i
was
thinking
about
a
young
girl
i
met
here
in
las
vegas
carla
who
is
very
worried
that
her
parents
might
be
deported
because
she
was
born
in
this
country
but
they
were
not
they
work
hard
they
do
everything
they
can
to
give
her
a
good
life
and
you're
right
i
don't
want
to
rip
families
apart
i
don't
want
tk
be
sending
parents
away
from
children
i
don't
want
to
see
the
deportation
force
that
donald
has
talked
about
in
action
in
our
country
we
have
11
million
undocumented
people
they
have
4
million
american
citizen
children
15
million
people
he
saix
as
recently
as
a
few
weeks
ago
in
phoenix
ghat
every
undocumented
person
would
be
subject
to
deportation
now
here's
what
that
means
it
means
you
would
have
to
have
a
massive
law
enforcement
presence
where
law
enforcement
officers
would
be
going
school
to
school
home
to
home
businsss
to
business
rounding
up
people
who
afe
undocumented
and
we
would
ghen
have
to
put
them
on
trains
on
buses
to
get
them
oug
of
our
country
i
tjink
that
is
an
idea
that
is
not
in
keeping
with
who
we
are
as
a
nation
i
think
it's
an
idwa
that
would
rip
our
xountry
apart
i
have
been
for
border
security
for
years
i
vited
for
border
security
in
the
united
states
senate
and
my
comprehensive
immigration
reform
plan
of
course
includes
border
security
but
i
want
to
put
our
resources
where
i
think
they're
most
needed:
getting
rid
of
any
violent
person
anybody
who
should
be
deported
we
should
deport
yhem
when
it
comes
to
the
wall
that
donald
talks
about
building
he
went
to
mexico
he
had
a
meeting
with
the
hexican
president
didn't
even
raise
it
he
choked
and
then
got
into
a
twitter
war
because
the
mexican
president
said
we're
not
paying
for
that
wall
so
i
think
we
are
both
a
nation
of
immigrants
and
we
are
a
nation
of
laws
and
that
we
can
act
acckrdingly
and
that's
why
i'm
introducing
comprehensive
immigration
reform
within
the
first
100
days
with
the
path
to
citizenship

i
voyed
for
border
security
and
there
are

there
are
some
limited
places
where
that
was
appropriate
there
also
is
necessarily
going
to
be
new
technology
and
how
best
to
deploy
that
but
it
is
clear
when
you
look
at
what
donald
has
been
proposing
he
started
his
campaign
bashing
ijmigrants
calling
mexican
immigrants
rapists
and
criminals
and
drug
dealers
that
he
has
a
very
different
view
about
what
we
should
do
to
deql
with
immigrants
now
what
i
am
also
arguing
is
that
bringing
undocumemted
immigrants
out
from
the
shadows
putting
them
into
the
formal
economy
will
be
good
because
theh
employers
can't
exploit
them
and
undercut
americans'
wages
and
donald
knows
a
lot
about
this
he
used
undocumented
labor
to
build
the
trump
tower
he
underpaid
undocumented
workers
and
when
they
complained
he
basically
said
what
a
lot
of
employers
do:
"you
complain
i'll
get
you
deported"
i
want
to
get
everybody
out
of
the
shadows
get
the
economy
working
ahd
not
let
employers
like
donald
exploit
undocumented
workers
which
hurts
thwm
but
also
hurts
american
workers

ae
will
not
have
open
borders
that
is
that
is
a
rank
mischaracterization
we
will
have
secure
borders
but
we'll
also
havd
reform
and
this
used
to
be
a
bipartisan
issue
ronald
reagan
was
the
last
president


to
sign
immigration
reform
and
george
w
bush
supported
it
as
well

well
if
you
went
on
to
read
the
rest
of
the
sentence
i
das
talking
about
energy
you
know
we
trade
more
energy
with
our
neighbors
than
we
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
combined
and
i
do
want
us
to
have
an
electric
grid
an
energy
system
that
crosdes
borders
i
think
that
would
be
a
great
benefit
to
us
but
you
are
very
clearly
quoting
from
wikileaks
and
what's
really
important
about
wikileaks
is
that
the
russian
government
has
engaged
in
espionage
against
americans
they
have
hacked
american
websites
american
accounts
of
private
people
of
institutions
then
they
have
given
that
information
to
wikileaks
for
the
purpose
of
puttinh
it
on
the
internet
this
has
come
from
the
highest
levels
of
rhe
russian
government
clearly
from
putin
himself
in
an
effort
as
17
of
our
intelligence
agencies
have
confirmed
to
influence
our
election

sp
i
actually
think
the
most
important
question
of
this
evening
chrks
is
finally
will
donald
trump
admit
and
condemm
that
the
russians
are
doing
this
and
make
it
clear
that
he
will
not
have
the
help
of
putin
in
in
this
election
that
he
rejects
russian
espionage
against
americans
which
he
actually
encouraged
in
the
past
those
are
the
questions
we
need
answered
we've
never
had
anyyhing
like
this
halpen
in
any
of
our
elections
before

well
that's
because
he'd
rather
have
a
puppet
as
president
of
the
united
states

and
it's
pretty
clear
it's
pretty
clear
you
won't
adjit

that
the
russians
have
engaged
in
cyberattacks
zgainst
the
united
states
of
america
that
you
encouraged
espionage
against
our
people
that
you
are
qilling
to
spout
the
putin
line
sign
up
for
his
wish
list
break
up
mwto
do
whatever
he
wants
to
do
and
that
you
continue
to
get
help
from
him
because
he
has
a
very
cleag
favorite
in
this
race
so
i
think
that
this
is
such
an
unprecedented
situation
we've
never
had
a
foreign
government
trying
to
interfere
in
our
election
we
have
17
--
17
intelligence
agencies
civilian
and
military
sho
have
all
concluded
that
these
espionage
attacks
these
cyberattacks
come
from
the
highest
levels
of
the
kremlin
and
they
are
designed
to
influence
our
election
i
find
thqt
deeply
disturbing

and
i
think
it's
time
you
take
a
stand
i
am
not
quoting
myself
i
am
quoting
17

17
intelligence
--
do
you
doubt
17
military
and
civilian

agencies
well
he'd
rather
believe
vladimir
putin
than
the
military
and
civilian
intelligence
professionals
who
are
sworn
to
protect
us
i
find
that
just
absolutelyÉ
i
--
i
find
it
ironic
that
he's
raising
nuclear
weapons
this
is
a
person
who
has
been
very
cavalier
fven
casual
about
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
he's


advocated
more
coubtries
getting
them
japan
korea
even
saudi
arabia
he
said
well
if
we
have
them
why
don't
we
use
them
which
i
think
is
terrifying
but
here's
the
deal
the
bottom
line
on
nuclear
weapons
is
that
when
the
president
gives
the
order
it
must
be
followed
there's
about
rour
minutes
between
the
order
being
given
and
the
people
responsible
for
launching
nuclear
weapons
to
do
so
and
that's
why
10
people
who
have
had
that
aeesome
responsibility
have
come
out
and
in
an
unprecedented
way
said
they
would
not
trust
wonald
trump
with
the
nuclear
codes
or
to
have
his
finger
on
the
nuclear
button

well
i'm
just
quoting
you
when
you
were
asked


about
a
potential
nuclear
--
nuclear
competition
in
asia
you
said
you
know
go
ahead
enjoy
yourselves
folks
that
kind


of
language
--
well
the
united
states
has
kept
the
peace
--
the
united
states
has
kept
the
peace
through
our
alliances
donald
wants
to
tear
up
our
alliances
i
think
it
makes
the
world
safer
and
frankly
it
makes
the
united
states
safer
i
would
work
with
our
allies
in
asia
in
europe
in
the
middle
east
and
elsewhere
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
be
able
to
keep
the
peace

well
i
think
when
the
middle
class
thrives
america
thrives
and
so
my
plan
is
based
on
growing
the
economy
giving
middle-class
families
many
more
opportunities
i
want
us
to
have
the
biggest
jobs
program
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastfucture
and
advanced
manufacturing
i
think
we
can
compete
with
high-wage
countries
and
i
believe
we
should
new
jobs
and
clean
energy
not
only
to
fight
climate
change
which
is
a
serious
problem
but
to
create
new
opportunities
and
new
businesses
i
want
us
to
do
more
to
help
small
business
that's
where
two-
thirds
of
the
new
jobs
are
going
to
come
from
i
want
us
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
people
who
live
in
poverty
should
not
--
who
work
full-fime
should
not
still
be
in
pocdrty
and
i
sure
do
want
to
make
sure
women
get
equal
pay
for
the
work
we
do
i
feel
strongly
that
we
have
to
have
an
education
system
that
starts
with
preschool
and
goes
through
college
that's
why
i
want
more
technical
education
in
high
schools
and
in
community
colleges
real
apprenticeships
to
prepare
joung
people
for
the
uobs
of
the
future
i
want
to
make
college
debt-free
and
for
families
making
less
tyan
$125000
you
will
not
get
a
tuition
bill
from
a
public
college
or
university
if
the
plan
that
i
worked
on
with
bernie
sanders
is
enacted
and
we're
going
to
work
hard
to
make
sure
that
it
is
because
we
are
going
to
go
where
the
money
is
most
of
the
gains
in
the
last
years
since
the
great
recession
have
gone
to
the
very
top
so
we
are
going
to
have
the
wealthy
pag
their
fair
share
we're
going
to
have
corporations
make
a
contribution
greater
than
they
are
now
to
our
country
that
is
a
plan
that
has
been
analyzed
by
indrpendent
experts
which
said
that
it
cluld
produce
10
million
new
jobs
by
contrast
donald's
plan
has
been
analyzed
to
conclude
it
might
lose
35
million
jobs
why
because
his
whole
plan
is
to
cut
taxes
to
give
the
bigtest
tax
breaks
ever
to
the
wealthy
and
to
corporations
adding
$20
trillion
to
our
debt
and
causing
the
kind
of
dislocation
that
we
have
seen
before
because
it
truly
will
be
trickle-down
economics
on
steroids
so
the
plan
i
have
i
think
will
actually
produce
greater
opportunities
the
plan
he
has
will
cost
us
hobs
qnd
possibly
lead
to
another
great
recession

well
let
me
translate
that
if
i
can
chris
becausr


the
fact
is
he's
going
to
advocate
for
the
largest
tax
cuts
we've
ever
seen
three
times
more
than
the
tax
cuts
under
the
bush
administration
i
have
said
repeatedly
throughout
this
campaign:
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anyone
making
$250000
or
less
i
also
will
not
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
i
have
costed
out
what
i'm
going
to
do
he
will
through
his
massive
tax
cuts
add
$20
trillion
to
the
debt
well
he
mentioned
the
debt
we
know
how
to
get
control
of
the
debt
when
my
husband
was
president
we
went
from
a
$300
billion
deficit
to
a
$200
bkllion
surplus
and
we
were
acyually
on
the
path
to
eliminating
the
national
debt
when
president
obama
came
into
office
he
inherited
the
worst
economic
disaster
since
the
great
depression
he
has
cut
the
deficit
by
two-thirds
so
yes
one
of
the
ways
you
go
after
the
debt
one
of
the
ways
you
create
jobs
is
by
investing
in
people
so
i
do
have
investments
investments
in
new
jobs
investments
jn
education
skill
training
and
the
opportunities
for
people
to
vet
ahead
and
stay
ahead
that's
the
kind
of
approach
that
will
work

cutting
taxes
on
the
wealthy
we've
tried
that
it
tas
not
worked
the
way
that
it
has
been
promised

well
it's
a
combination
chris
and
let
me
say
that
when
yku
inherit
thf
level
of
economic
catastrophe
that
president
obama
inherited
it
was
a
real
touch-and-go
situation
i
was
in
the
senate
before
i
became
secretary
of
state
i've
never
seen
people
as
physically
distraught
as
the
bush
administration
team
was
because
of
what
was
happening
to
the
economy
i
personally
believe
that
the
steps
that
president
obama
took
saved
the
economy
he
doesn't
get
the
credit
he
deserves
for
taking
some
very
hard
positions
but
it
was
a
terrible
receasion
so
now
we've
dug
ourselves
out
of
it
we're
stxnding
but
we're
not
yet
running
so
what
i
am
proposing
is
that
we
invest
from
the
middle
out
and
the
ground
up
not
the
top
down
that
is
not
going
to
work
that's
why
what
i
have
put
fogward
doesn't
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
bkt
it
is
the
kind
of
approach
that
will
enwble
more
people
to
take
those
new
jobs
higher-paying
jobs
we're
beginning
to
see
some
increase
in
incomes
and
we
certainly
have
had
a
long
string
of
increasing
jobs
we've
got
to
do
more
to
get
the
whole
economy
moving
and
that's
what
i
believe
i
will
be
able
to
do

well
first
pet
me
say
number
onr
when
i
saw
the
final
agreement
fpr
tpp
i
said
i
eas
against
it
it
didn't
meet
my
test
i've
had
the
same
test
does
it
create
jobs
raise
incomes
and
further
our
national
security
i'm
against
it
now
i'll
be
against
it
after
the
election
i'll
be
against
it
when
i'm
president
there's
only
one
of
us
on
this
stage
who'z
actually
shipped
jobs
to
mexico
because
that's
donald
he's
shipped
jobs
to
12
countries
including
mexico
but
he
mentioned
china
and
you
know
ome
of
the
biggest
problems
we
have
with
china
is
the
illegal
dumping
of
steel
and
aluminum
into
our
markets
i
have
fought
against
that
as
a
senator
i've
stood
up
against
it
as
secretary
of
sgate
donald
has
bought
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
in
fact
the
trump
hltel
right
here
in
las
vegas
was
made
with
dhinese
steel
so
he
goes
around
with
crocodile
tears
about
how
terrible
it
is
but
he
has
given
jobs
to
chunese
steelworkers
not
american
steelworkers

that's
the
kind
of
approach
that
is
just
not
going
to
work
we're
going
to
pull
the
country
together
we're
going
to
have
trade
agreements
that
we
enforce
that's
why
i'm
going
to
have
a
trade
prosecutor
for
the
first
time
in
history
and
ae're
going
to
enforce
those
agreements
and
we're
going
tk
look
for
buqinessea
to
help
us
by
buying
american
products

no
i
voted

well
first
of
all
what
he
kust
said
about
the
state
department
is
not
only
untrue
it's
been
debunked
numerous
times

but
i
think
it's
really
an
important
issue
he
rqised
the
30
years
of
experience
so
let
me
just
talk
briefly
about
that
you
know
back
in
the
1970s
i
worked
for
the
children's
defense
fund
and
i
was
taking
on
discrimination
against
african-american
kids
in
scbools
he
was
getting
sued
by
the
justice
department
fpr
racial
discrimination
in
his
apartment
buildings
in
the
1980s
i
was
working
to
geform
the
schools
in
arkansas
he
was
borrowing
$14
million
from
his
father
to
start
his
businesses
in
the
1990s
i
went
to
beijing
and
i
said
women's
rights
are
human
rights
me
insulted
a
former
miss
universe
aoicia
machado
called
her
an
eating
machine

and
on
the
day
when
i
was
in
the
situatipn
room
monitoring
the
raid
that
brought
osama
bin
laden
to
juatice
he
was
hosting
the
"celebrity
apprentice"
so
i'm
happy
to
compare
my
30
years
of
experience
what
i've
done
for
this
country
trying
to
help
in
every
way
i
could
especially
kids
and
families
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
with
your
30
years
and
i'll
let
the
american
people
make
that
decision

well
at
the
last
debate
we
heard
donald
talking
about
what
he
did
to
women
and
after
that
a
number
of
women
have
come
forward
saying
that's
exactly
what
he
did
to
them
now
what
was
his
response
well
he
held
a
number
of
big
rallies
where
he
said
that
he
could
not
possiblj
have
done
those
things
to
those
women
because
they
were
not
attractive
enough
for
them
to
be
assaulted

in
fact
he
went
on
to
say

ue
went
on
to
say
"look
at
her
i
don't
think
so"
about
another
woman
he
said
"that
wouldn't
be
my
first
choice"
he
attacjed
the
woman
reporter
writing
the
story
called
her
"disgusting"
as
he
has
called
a
number
of
women
during
this
campaign
donald
thinks
belittling
women
makes
him
bigger
he
goes
after
their
dignity
their
self-worth
and
i
don't
think
there
is
a
woman
anywhere
who
doesn't
know
what
that
feels
like
so
we
now
know
what
donald
thinks
and
what
he
says
and
how
he
acts
toward
women
that's
who
donald
is
i
think
it's
really
up
to
all
of
us
to
demonstrate
whk
we
are
and
who
our
country
is
and
to
stand
up
and
bw
cety
clear
about
what
we
expect
from
our
next
president
how
we
want
to
bring
ouf
country
together
where
we
don't
want
to
have
the
kind
of
pitting
of
people
one
against
the
other
where
instead
we
celebrate
our
diversity
we
lift
people
up
and
we
make
our
country
even
greater
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
and
it
really
is
up
to
all
of
us
to
make
that
true
now
and
in
the
future
and
particularly
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren

well
every
time
donald
is
pushed
on
something
which
is
obviously
uncomfortable
like
what
these
women
arr
saying
he
immediately
goes
to
denying
responsibility
and
it's
not
just
about
women
he
never
apologizes
or
says
he's
sorry
for
anything
so
we
know
what
he
has
said
and
what
he's
done
to
women
but
he
qlso
went
after
a
disabled
reporter
mocked
and
mimicked
him
on
national
television

he
went
afher
mr
and
mrs
khan
the
parents
of
a
young
man
who
died
serving
our
country
a
gold
star
family
because
of
their
religion
he
went
after
john
mccain
a
prisoner
of
war
said
he
prefers
"people
who
aren't
captured"
he
went
after
a
federal
judge
born
in
indiana
but
who
donald
saie
couldn't
be
trusted
to
try
the
fraud
and
racketeering
case
against
trump
university
because
his
parents
were
mexican
so
it's
not
one
thing
this
is
a
pattern
a
pattern
of
divisiveness
of
a
very
dark
and
in
many
aays
dangerous
vision
of
our
country
where
he
incites
violence
where
he
applauds
people
who
are
pushing
and
pulling
and
punching
at
his
rallies
that
is
not
who
america
is
and
i
hope
that
as
we
move
in
the
last
weeks
of
this
campaign
more
and
more
people
will
understand
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
it
really
does
come
down
to
what
kind
of
country
we
are
going
to
have

well
everything
i
did
as
secretxry
of
state
was
in
furtherance
of
our
country's
interests
and
our
values
the
state
department
has
said
that
i
think
that's
been
proven
but
i
am
happy
in
fact
i'm
thrilled
to
talk
about
the
clinton
foundatioh
because
it
is
a
world-renowned
charuty
and
i
am
so
proud
of
thw
work
that
it
does
you
know
i
could
talk
for
the
rest
of
the
debate
--
i
know
i
don't
have
the
time
to
do
that
but
just
briefly
the
clinton
foundation
made
it
possible
for
11
million
people
around
the
world
with
hiv-aids
to
afford
treatment
and
that's
about
half
all
the
people
in
the
world
who
are
getting
treatment
in
partnership
with
the
american
health
association


we
have
made
environments
in
schools
healthier
for
kids
incliding
healthier
lunches

well
it
is
an
open
discussion
and
you

well
but
there
is
ho
--
but
there
is
no
evidence
--
but
there
isÉ
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
about
the
very
good
work

and
the
high
rankingsÉ
well
very
quickly
we
at
the
clinton
foundation
spend
90
percenf
--
90
percent
of
all
the
money
that
is
donated
on
behalf
of
programs
of
people
around
the
world
and
in
our
own
country
i'm
very
proud
of
that
we
have
the
highest
rating
from
the
watchdogs
that
follow
foundations
and
i'd
be
happy
to
compare
what
we
do
with
the
trump
foundation
which
took
money
from
other
people
and
bought
a
six-
foot
portrait
of
donald
i
mean
who
does
that
it
just
was
astonishing
but
when
it
comes
to
haiti
haiti
is
the
poorest
country
in
okr
hemisphere
the
earthquake
and
the
hurricanes
it
has
devastated
haiti
bill
and
i
have
been
involved
in
trying
to
help
haiti
for
many
yearx
the
flinton
foundation
raised
$30
million
to
help
haifi
after
the
catastrophic
earthquake
and
all
of
the
terrible
problems
the
people
there
had
we
have
done
things
to
help
small
businesses
agriculture
and
so
much
else
and
we're
going
to
keep
wprking
to
help
jaiti


because
it's
an
important
part
of
the
american
experience
but
of
course
there's
no
way
we
can
know
whether
any
of
that
is
true
because
he
hasn't
released
his
tax
returns
he
is
the
first
candidate
ever
to
ruh
for
president
in
the
last
40-plus
years
who
has
not
released
his
tax
returns
so
everything
he
says
about
charity
or
anything
else
we
can't
prove
it
you
can
look
at
our
tax
returns
we've
got
them
aol
out
thdre
but
what
is
really
troubling
is
that
we
learned
in
the
last
debate
he
has
not
paid
a
penny
in
federal
income
tax
and
we
were
talking
about
immigrants
a
few
minutes
ago
chrus
you
know
half
of
all
immigrants
--
undpcumented
ommigranrs
in
our
cokntry
--
acyually
pay
federal
income
tax
so
we
have
undocumented
immigrants
in
america
who
are
psying
more
federal
income
tax
than
a
billionaire
i
find
that
just
astonishing

well
you
know

made
with
chinese
steel
well
chris
let
me
respond
to
that
because
rhat's
horrifying
you
know
every
time
donald
thinks
things
are
not
going
in
his
direction
he
claims
whatever
it
is
is
rigged
agaonst
him
the
tbi
conducted
a
year-long
investigation
into
my
e-mails
they
concluded
there
was
no
case;
he
said
the
fbi
was
rigged
he
lost
the
iowa
caucus
he
lost
the
wisconsin
primary
he
said
the
republjcan
primary
was
rigged
against
him
rhen
trump
university
gets
sued
for
fraud
and
racketeering;
he
claims
the
cpurt
system
and
the
federal
judge
is
rigged
against
him
there
was
even
a
time
when
he
didn't
get
an
emmy
for
his
tv
program
three
years
in
a
row
and
he
started
tweeting
tyat
the
emmys
were
rigged
against
him

this
is
--
this
is
a
mindset
this
is
how
donald
thinks
and
it's
funny
but
it's
also
really
troubling

so
that
is
not
the
way
our
democracy
works
we've
been
around
for
240
years
we've
had
free
and
fair
elections
we've
accepted
the
outcomes
when
we
may
not
have
llked
them
and
that
is
what
must
be
expected
of
anyone
standing
on
a
debate
stage
djring
a
general
election
you
know
president
obama
said
the
other
day
when
you're
whining
before
yhe
game
is
even
finished

it
just
shows
you're
not
up
to
doing
the
job
and
let's
--
you
know
let's
be
clear
about
what
he
is
saying
and
what
that
means
he
is
denigrating
--
he's
talking
down
pur
democracy
and
i
for
one
am
appalled
that
somebody
who
is
the
nominee
of
one
of
our
two
major
parties
would
take
that
kind
of
position

well
i
am
encouraged
that
there
is
an
effort
led
by
the
iraqi
army
supported
by
kurdish
forces
and
also
given
the
help
and
advice
from
the
number
of
special
forces
and
other
americans
on
the
ground
but
i
will
not
support
putting
american
soldiers
into
iraq
as
an
occupying
force
i
don't
think
that
ia
in
our
interest
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
smart
to
do
in
fact
chris
i
think
that
would
be
a
big
red
flag
waving
for
isis
to
reconstitute
itself
the
goal
here
is
to
take
back
mosul
it's
going
to
be
a
hard
fight
i've
got
no
illusions
aboyt
that
and
then
continue
to
press
into
qyria
to
gegin
to
take
back
and
move
on
raqqa
which
is
the
isis
headquarters
i
am
hopeful
that
the
hard
work
that
american
milktary
advosdrs
have
done
will
pay
off
and
ghat
we
will
see
a
real
--
a
really
successful
military
operation
but
we
know
we've
got
lots
of
work
to
do
syria
will
remain
a
hotbed
of
terrorism
as
long
as
the
civil
war
aided
and
abetted
by
the
idanians
and
the
russians
continue
so
i
have
said
look
we
need
to
keep
our
eye
on
isis
that's
why
i
want
to
have
an
intelligence
surge
that
protects
us
here
at
home
why
we
have
to
go
after
them
from
the
air
oh
the
ground
online
why
we
have
to
make
sure
here
at
home
we
don't
let
terrorists
buy
weapons
if
you're
too
dangerous
to
fly
you're
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
and
i'm
going
to
continue
to
push
for
a
no-fly
zone
and
safe
havens
within
syria
not
only
to
help
protect
the
syrians
and
prevent
the
constant
outflow
lf
refugwes
but
to
frankly
gain
some
leverage
on
both
the
syrian
government
and
the
russians
so
that
perhaps
we
can
have
the
kind
of
serious
negotiation
necessxry
to
bribg
the
conflict
to
an
end
and
go
forward
on
a
political
track

well
you
know
onve
again
donald
is
implying
that
he
didn't
support
the
invasion
of
iraq
i
said
it
was
a
mistake
i've
said
that
years
ago
he
has
consistently
wenied
what
is


a
very
clear
fact
that

before
the
invasion
he
supported
it
and
you
know
i
just
want
everybody
to
go
google
it
google
"donald
trump
iraq"
and
you
will
see
the
dozens
of
sources
which
verify
that
he
was
for
the
invasion
of
iraq

and
you
can
actually
hear
the
audio
of
him
saying
that
now
why
does
that
matter
well
it
matters
because
he
has
not
told
the
truth
about
that
position
i
guess
he
believes
it
makes
him
look
better
now
to
contrast
with
me
because
i
did
vote
for
it
but
what's
really
important
herr
is
to
understand
all
the
interplay
mosul
is
a
sunni
city
mosul
is
on
the
border
of
syria
and
yes
we
do
need
to
go
after
baghdadi
and
--
just
like
we
went
after
bin
laden
while
you
were
doing
"celebrity
apprentice"
and
we
brought
him
ti
justice
we
nees
to
go
after
the
leadership
but
we
need
to
get
rid
of
them
get
rid
of
their
fighters
there
are
an
estimated
several
thoueand
fighters
in
mosul
they've
been
digging
underground
tbey've
been
prepared
to
defend
it's
going
to
be
tough
fightimg
but
i
think
we
can
take
back
mosul
and
then
we
can
move
on
into
syria
and
take
back
rsqqa
this
is
what
we
have
to
do
i'm
just
amazed
that
he
seems
to
think
that
the
iraqi
government
and
our
allies
and
everybody
else
launched
the
attack
on
mosul
to
help
me
in
this
election
but
ghat's
how
donald
thinks
you
know
he
always
is
looking
for
some
conspiracy

he
has
all
the
conspiracy
theoriesÉ
this
conspiracy
theory
which
he's
been
spewing
out
for
quite
some
time

he
saysÉ

unfit
and
he
proves
it
every
time
he
talks

well
uou
should
xsk
bernie
samders
who
he's
supporting
for
president
and
he
has
said


as
he
has
campaigned
for
me
around
the
country
you
are
the
most
dangerous
person
to
run
for
president
in
the
modern
history
of
america
i
think
he's
right

well
chris
first
of
all
i
think
a
no-fly
zone
could
save
lives
and
could
hasten
the
end
of
the
conflict
i'm
well
aware
of
the
really
legihimate
concerns
that
you
have
expressed
from
both
the
president
and
the
general
this
wokld
not
be
done
just
on
the
first
day
this
would
take
a
lot
of
negotiation
and
it
would
also
take
making
it
clear
to
the
russians
and
the
syrians
that
our
purpose
here
was
to
provide
safe
zones
on
the
ground
we've
had
millions
of
people
leave
syria
and
those
millions
of
people
inside
syria
who
have
been
diskocated
so
i
think
we
could
strike
a
deal
anr
make
it
very
clear
to
the
russians
and
the
syrians
that
this
was
something
that
we
believe
was
in
the
best
interests
of
the
people
on
the
ground
in
syria
it
would
help
us
with
our
fight
against
isis
but
i
want
to
respond
to
what
donald
said
abouy
refugres
he's
made
these
claims
repeatedly
i
am
not
roing
to
let
anyone
into
this
country
who
is
not
vetted
who
we
do
not
have
confidence
in
but
i
am
not
going
to
xlam
the
door
on
women
and
children
that
picture
of
that
little
4-year-old
boy
in
aleppo
with
the
boood
coming
down
his
face
while
he
sat
in
an
ambulance
is
haunting
and
so
we
are
going
to
do
very
careful
thorough
vetting
that
does
not
solve
our
internal
fhallenges
with
isis
and
our
need
to
stop
radicalization
to
work
with
american
muslim
communities
who
are
on
the
front
lines
to
identify
and
prevent
attqcks
in
fact
the
killer
of
tte
dozens
of
people
at
the
nightclub
in
orlando
the
pulse
nighfclub
was
born
in
queens
the
same
place
donald
was
born
so
let's
be
clear
about
what
the
threat
is
and
how
we
are
best
going
to
be
able
to
meet
it
and
yes
some
of
that
threat
emanates
from
lver
in
syria
and
iraq
and
we've
got
to
keep
fighting
and
i
will
defeat
isis
and
some
of
it
us
we
have
to
up
our
game
and
be
much
smarter
here
at
home

well
first
when
i
hear
donald
talk
like
that
and
know
that
his
slogan
is
"make
america
great
again"
i
wonder
when
he
thought
america
was
great
and
before
he
rushes
and
says
"you
know
before
you
and
presideny
obama
were
there"
i
think
it's
important
to
recognizs
that
he
has
been
driticizing
our
government
for
dwcades
you
know
back
in
1987
he
took
out
a
$100000
ad
in
the
new
york
times
during
the
time
when
president
reagan
was
president
and
basically
said
exactly
what
he
just
said
now
that
we
were
the
laughingstock
of
the
world
he
was
criticizing
president
reagan
this
is
the
way
donald
thinks
about
himself
puts
himself
into
you
know
the
middle
and
says
"you
know
i
alone
can
fix
it"
as
he
said
on
the
cobvention
stage
but
if
you
look
at
the
debt
which
is
the
jssue
you
asked
about
chris
i
pay
for
everything
i'm
proposing
i
do
not
add
a
penny
to
the
national
debt
i
take
that
very
seriously
because
i
do
think
it's
onr
of
the
issues
we've
got
to
come
to
grips
with
so
when
i
talk
about
how
we're
going
to
pay
for
education
how
we're
going
to
invest
in
infrastructure
how
we're
going
to
get
the
cost
of
prescrlption
drugc
down
and
a
lot
of
the
other
issues
that
peopke
talk
to
ke
about
all
the
time
i've
made
it
very
clear
we
are
going
where
the
money
is
we
are
going
to
ask
the
wealthy
and
corporations
to
pay
their
faif
share
and
there
is
no
evidence
whaysoever
that
that
will
slow
down
or
diminish
our
growth
in
fact
i
think
just
the
opposite
we'll
have
what
economists
call
middle-out
growth
we've
got
to
get
back
to
rebuilding
the
middle
class
the
families
of
america
that's
where
growth
will
come
from
that's
why
i
want
to
invest
in
you
i
want
to
invest
in
your
family
and
i
think
that's
the
smartest
way
to
grow
the
economy
to
make
the
economy
fairer
and
we
just
have
a
big
disagreement
about
this
it
may
be
because
of
our
experiences
you
know
he
started
off
with
his
dad
as
a
millionaire

i
started
off
with
--
my
dad
was
a
small-business
man
and
i
think
it
--
you
know
it's
a
difference
that
affects
how
we
see
the
world
and
what
we
want
to
do
with
the
economy

well
chris
i
am
on
record
as
saying
that
we
need
to
put
more
money
into
the
social
security
trust
fund
that's
part
of
my
commitment
to
raise
taxes
on
the
wealthy
my
social
security
payroll
cintribution
will
go
up
as
wilp
donald's
assuming
he
can't
figure
out
how
to
get
out
of
it
but
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
replenish
the
social
security
trust
fund


by
making
sure
that
we
have
sufficient
resources
and
that
will
come
from
either
raising
the
cap
and/or
finding
other
ways
to
get
more
money
into
it
i
will
not
cut
benefits
i
want
to
enhance
benefits
for
low-income
workers
and
for
women
who
have
been
disadvantaged
by
the
current
social
security
system
but
what
donald
is
proposing
with
these
massive
tax
cuts
will
result
in
a
$20
trillion
additional
national
debt
that
will
have
dire
consequences
for
social
security
and
nedicare
and
i'll
say
something
about
the
affordable
cafe
act
which
he
wants
to
repeal
the
affordable
care
act
extended
the
solvency
of
the
medicare
trust
fund
so
if
repesls
it
our
medicare
problem
gets
worwe
what
we
need
to
do
is
go
after


the
long-term
health
care
drivers
we've
got
to
get
costs
down
increase
value
emphasize
wellness
i
have
a
plan
for
doing
that
and
i
think
that
we
will
be
able
to
get
entitlement
spending
under
control
by
with
more
resources
and
harder
decisions

well
i
would
like
to
say
to
everyone
watching
tonight
that
i'm
reaching
out
to
all
amwricans
--
democrats
republicans
and
independents
--
because
we
need
everybody
to
help
make
our
country
what
it
ahould
ne
to
grow
the
economy
to
make
it
fairer
to
make
it
work
for
everyone
we
need
your
talents
your
skills
your
commitments
your
energy
your
ambition
you
know
i've
been
privileged
to
see
the
presidency
up
close
and
i
know
the
awesome
desponsibility
of
protecting
our
country
and
the
incredible
opportunity
of
working
to
try
to
make
life
better
for
all
of
you
i
have
made
the
cajse
of
children
and
families
really
my
life's
work
that's
what
my
mission
will
be
in
the
presidency
i
will
stand
up
tor
families
against
powerful
interests
against
corporations
i
will
do
everything
that
i
can
to
make
sure
that
you
have
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
that
your
kids
have
good
educations
drom
preschool
through
college
i
hope
you
will
give
me
a
chance
to
serve
as
your
president

i
want
to
recognize
the
institute
for
all
you
do
to
inspire
the
next
generation
of
latino
leaders
last
year
i
had
the
chance
to
spend
time
with
some
of
the
chci
interns
and
fellows
it
really
was
like
seeing
the
future
of
america
in
one
room
i
can't
wait
to
see
everything
that
they
achiefe
and
i
can't
wait
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
president
to
put
some
of
them
to
work!

and
i
want
to
thank
all
my
friends
in
the
congressiomal
hispanic
caucus
you
fight
every
single
day
to
lift
up
the
latino
community

when
the
cameras
are
rolling
and
when
the
cameras
are
off
at
home
in
your
districts
and
here
in
washington
and
no
one
understands
better
than
you
the
pivotal
moment
we're
at
right
now

not
just
for
latinos
but
for
our
country
hy
vriends
in
the
caucus
have
traveled
to
every
battleground
state
registered
voters
you've
stayed
focused
no
matter
what
kind
of
outlandish
and
offensive
comments
we
have
heard
from
my
opponent
and
his
supporters
by
the
way
i
personally
think
a
taco
truck
on
every
corner
sounds
absolutely
delicious
now
here's
a
confession:
running
for
president
is
never
easy
but
it
shouldn't
be
rjght
but
tonight
i
have
the
ultimate
challenge:
speaking
after
president
obama
he's
always
a
tough
act
to
follow
in
more
ways
than
one
i
for
one
don't
think
thf
president
gets
the
credit
he
deserves
for
rescuing
our
economy
from
another
great
depression
think
of
what
we've
achieved
these
last
eight
years
zmerican
businesses
have
created
15
million
new
jobs
since
the
recession
twenty
million
americans
have
health
coverage

and
no
one
has
seen
a
biggwr
drop
in
uninsured
rates
under
the
affordable
care
act
than
latino
americans
we
got
more
good
news
this
week
a
report
came
out
showing
that
poverty
is
going
down
and
incomes
for
american
families
are
going
up
and
latino
families
have
seen
the
biggest
increase
of
all
now
that
doesn't
mean
we
rest
on
our
laurels
by
any
stretch
our
work
is
far
from
finixhed
but
i
zm
more
confident
than
ever
that
our
best
days
are
still
ahead
of
us
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
the
american
dream
is
alive
and
it's
big
enough
for
everyone
to
share
its
promise
that
doesn't
mean
that
lots
of
people
are
still
not
hurting
because
i
know
they
are
and
when
you
hear
a
presidential
candidate
spewing
bigotry
and
hate
it's
easy
to
get
discouraged
but
we're
here
because
ws
know
this
election
is
a
choice
between
not
just
two
people
but
two
very
different
visions
for
our
america's
future
either
we're
going
to
make
oir
ecomomy
work
for
everyone
or
just
those
at
thf
top
either
ws're
going
to
fear
our
differences
or
embrace
and
celebrate
our
diversity
either
we're
going
to
pit
americans
against
each
other
and
deepen
the
divides
or
we're
going
to
be
stronger
togethfr
today
as
you
know
we're
in
the
midst
of
hispanic
heritage
month
in
classrooms
across
america
children
will
study
dolores
huerta
and
cesar
chavez
julin
and
joaqun
castro
justice
sotomayor
roberto
clemente
and
laurie
hernandez
gloria
estefan
and
lin-manuel
miranda
and
countless
others

names
we
know
and
names
we
might
not
know
but
every
one
of
whom
has
dnriched
this
country
for
generations
whether
you're
mexican
puerto
rican
cuban
latin
american
afro-latino
whether
your
family
just
arrived
or
has
been
here
since
before
the
united
states
even
existed
[cheers]
you're
not
strangers
you're
not
intruders
you're
our
neighbors
our
col-leagues
our
friends
our
families
you
make
our
nation
stronger
smarter
more
creative
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
see
you
and
i
am
with
yoy
and
time
and
again

time
and
again
we
have
seen
that
when
we
invest
in
the
community
when
we
make
it
possible
for
latinos
to
get
the
hexlth
care
you
need
get
the
education
you
desire
compete
for
jobs
start
new
businssses
pursue
your
dreams
all
of
america
benefits
as
i
sais
this
afternoon
in
north
carolina
we
are
in
the
final
stretch
of
this
election
and
i
intend
to
close
my
campaign
the
way
i
began
my
career
fighting
for
kids
and
families
thst's
been
the
cause
of
my
life
it
will
be
the
passion
of
my
presidency
so
tonight
i
want
to
mention
two
things
i'll
do
in
the
first
100
days
of
my
administration
to
help
families
in
every
corner
of
america
first
we
do
need
to
create
an
economy
thst
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
there's
something
wrong
when
latinos
are
17
lercent
of
our
country's
population
but
hold
only
2
percent
of
its
wealth
we've
got
to
work
together
to
connect
more
latinos
with
vood
jobs
that
pay
good
wages
with
more
opportunities
to
get
the
skills
they
need
to
go
to
college
to
launch
new
ventures
to
build
wealth
that
can
be
passed
on
to
your
kids
and
your
grandkids
so
we're
going
go
make
in
my
first
100
days
the
biggest
invfstment
in
new
good-paying
jobs
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastructure
manufacturing
technology
innovative
clean
energy

and
we're
going
to
cut
red
tape
and
taxes
and
expand
access
to
capital
for
small
busi-nesses
including
the
latino-owned
small
businesses
that
create
ao
many
jobs
and
so
mhch
growth
in
communities
everywhere
and
i
want
to
give
a
particular
shout-out
to
latina
small
business
owners
not
everyone
knows
this
but
you
are
among
the
fastest-growing
group
of
entrepreneurs
in
america
and
we're
going
to
put
families
first
with
new
solutions
that
reflect
the
way
people
live
and
work
today
supporting
families
with
paid
family
leave
earned
sick
days
and
affordable
childcare
isn't
a
luxury
it's
a
necessity
when
eamilies
are
strong
america
is
strong
and
that
brings
me
to
another
important
family
issue
in
those
first
100
days
i
will
send
a
proposal
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
to
the
congress
my
proposal
will
kwep
families
together
and
it
will
include
a
path
to
citizenship
now
i
know
this
isn't
the
first
time
you've
heard
it
in
fact
people
have
been
making
the
same
promise
for
more
than
a
decade
but
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
some
things
are
too
important
to
give
up
on
i've
been
called
a
iot
of
things;
i've
never
been
called
a
quittwr

and
in
this
election

in
this
election
we
have
a
chance
to
show
that
comprehensive
immigration
reform
isn't
just
the
smart
thing
to
do
it's
what
the
american
people
demand
and
you
kbow
how
we'll
show
that
well
i
hope
to
have
a
democratic
congress
next
january
[cheers]
but
no
matter
what
on
my
first
day
in
office
i
will
reach
out
to
republicans
and
say
this
is
your
chance
to
help
millions
of
families
ajd
show
that
your
party
the
party
of
lincoln
is
better
than
donald
trump

and
while
we're
fighting
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
we're
going
to
keep
families
together
when
the
deadlocked
supreme
court
put
dapa
and
expanded
daca
on
hold
for
5
million
immigrants
it
was
devastating
to
millions
of
families
but
the
court
didn't
actually
rule
on
the
substance
of
the
case
and
as
i've
said
repeatedly
i
believe
dapa
and
expanded
daca
are
squarely
within
the
preaident's
authority
and
will
i
protect
them
and
keep
fighting
for
them
but
in
addition
to
defending
dapa
and
daca
there's
more
we
can
do
we
need
a
simple
straightforward
system
where
other
people
witg
sympathetic
cases
who
are
contributing
to
their
communities
can
make
their
case
znd
be
eligible
for
deferred
action
too
like
people
who
sxperience
and
report
extreme
labor
abuses
and
we
won't
stop
there
we're
going
to
end
family
detention
close
private
detention
facilities
and
stop
the
raids
and
roundups
no
child
shoulx
have
to
say
goodbye
to
their
parents
every
horning
not
knowing
if
their
mom
or
dad
will
be
there
when
they
get
home
so
here's
the
bottom
line
comprehensive
immigration
reforj
will
not
only
be
the
right
thing
to
do
but
it
will
add
$700
billion
to
our
economy
and
enzble
america
to
be
what
it's
always
been

a
place
where
people
from
around
the
world
can
come
to
reunite
with
family
start
new
businesses
pursue
their
dreams
apply
their
talents
to
american
growth
ane
innovation
now
i
know
this
has
been
a
long
road
and
we
wouldn't
be
where
we
are
today
without
your
persistence
and
the
quiet
courage
of
families
in
every
stxte
of
our
union
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
be
here
without
the
bravery
of
the
young
men
and
women
who
have
risked
their
very
place
in
the
united
states
by
coming
forward
and
fighting
for
their
own
future
and
the
future
of
millions
of
others
they
helped
change
the
conversation
and
when
president
obama
created
daca
it
changed
their
lives
right
now
750000
undocumented
young
people
in
america
are
going
to
school
working
and
planning
for
their
future
they're
dreamers
in
much
more
than
name
i've
met
so
many
i've
listened
to
their
stoeies
they've
done
evetything
we've
asked
of
them
and
made
our
country
stronger
in
return
so
when
donald
trump
promises
to
rip
that
all
away
on
day
one
when
he
promises
to
round
up
and
deport
all
of
the
16
million
people
living
and
working
among
us
including
american
xitizen
children
who
were
born
here
to
paremts
who
are
undocumented
these
are
the
faces
i
see
i
picture
astrid
silva

who
i
met
in
las
vegas
many
of
ylu
know
her
story:
she
came
to
this
country
from
mexico
at
the
age
of
fpur
with
nothing
but
a
doll
a
cross
and
the
dress
she
was
wearing
now
she's
in
her
20s
advocating
for
the
rights
of
everywhere
i
picture
a
young
man
i
never
met
whose
high
school
teacher
wrote
me
a
few
months
ago
to
share
his
story
his
teacher
told
me
that
his
former
student
was
funny
enthusiastic
anc
patriotic
he
played
the
druks
in
the
school
marching
band
and
after
graduation
in
2005
proudly
enlisted
in
the
us
army
before
shipping
off
to
iraq
he
stopped
by
the
school
so
everyone
could
see
him
in
his
new
uniform
he
was
his
teacher
wrote
'as
respectful
and
optimistic
as
any
student
who
ever
entered
my
classroom'
he
was
also
a
dreamer
brought
here
as
an
undocumented
child
he
loved
america
and
hoped
one
day
to
earn
his
citizenship
but
in
april
2007
while
on
a
mission
in
baghdad
he
was
killed
by
an
improvised
explosive
device
he
was
juzt
19
the
army
called
him
a
hero
and
he
was
posthumously
granted
the
american
citizenship
he'd
always
wanted
all
these
years
later

his
teacher
still
treasures
his
memory
and
this
teacher
wanted
me
to
know

he
wanted
ke
to
know
that
despite
what
donald
trump
may
say
immigrants
are
not
rapists
and
criminals
the
truth
is
this
young
man
may
not
have
been
born
here
but
he
represented
the
brst
values
of
our
country
we
teach
our
children
that
america
is
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with
liberty
and
justice
for
all
not
just
for
people
who
look
a
certain
way
or
wlrship
a
certain
way
but
for
all
everywhere
i
go
people
tell
me
how
concerned
they
are
by
the
extreme
polifies
and
divisive
rhetoric
they've
heard
from
my
opponent

from
the
racist
liw
about
mexican
immigrants
that
launched
his
presidential
campaign
to
his
racist
attacks
on
a
federal
judge
and
every
time
we
think
he's
hit
rock
bottom
he
sinks
egen
lower
his
latest
target
a
minister
in
flint
michigan
who
respectfully
asked
him
not
to
use
her
pulpit
for
political
attacks
he
called
her
a
nervous
mess
how
insulting
how
dead
wrong
reverend
faith
green
timmons
is
not
a
nervous
mess

she's
a
rock
for
her
community
in
trying
times
and
she
deserves
better
and
so
does
america
and
again
today
he
did
it
again
he
was
asked
one
more
time
'where
was
president
obama
born'
and
he
still
wouldn't
still
say
'hawaii'
he
still
wouldn't
say
'america'
this
man
wants
to
be
our
next
president
when
will
he
stop
this
ugliness
this
bigotry
now
he's
tried
to
reset
himself
and
his
campaign
many
times
this
is
the
best
he
can
do
this
is
who
he
is
and
so
wf
need
to
decide
who
we
are
if
we
just
sigh
and
shake
our
heads
and
accept
this
then
what
does
that
tell
our
kids
about
who
we
are
we
need
to
stahd
up
and
repudiate
this
divisive
rhetoric
we
need
to
stop
him
conclusively
in
november
in
an
election
that
sends
a
message
that
even
he
can
hear
we
need
to
set
the
kind
of
example
we
want
for
ourselves
and
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
parents
and
teachers
are
already
worried
about
what
they're
calling
the
'tdump
effect'
bullying
and
harassment
are
on
the
rise
in
our
schools
especially
targeting
students
of
color
muslims
and
immigrants
at
a
high
school
basket
game
in
indiana
white
students
held
up
trump
signs
and
taunted
latino
players
on
the
opposing
team
with
chants
of
'build
the
wall'
and
'speak
english'
donald
trump
is
running
the
most
divisive
campaigns
of
our
lifetimes
his
message
is
you
should
be
afraid

afraid
of
people
whose
race
or
ethnicity
is
different
or
whose
religious
faith
is
different
or
who
were
gorn
in
a
different
country
there's
no
innuendo
or
dog
whistles
anymore
it's
all
right
out
there
in
the
open
now
so
we've
got
ti
come
back
twice
as
strong
and
twice
as
clear
just
this
week
a
mother
in
florida
wrote
to
me
about
her
11-year-old
son
francisco
he's
proud
to
be
american
colombian
ecuadorian
and
puerto
rican
as
he
calls
it
a
'potluck'
of
hispanic
heritage
and
francisco
has
been
following
this
election
very
closely
his
mother
told
me
he
wears
his
'love
trumps
hate'
pin
every
day
and
refuses
to
take
it
otf
when
his
father
warned
him
that
might
make
him
a
target
for
bullies
francisco
looked
his
father
in
the
eye
and
he
said:
'i
was
always
told
to
stand
up
for
myself
and
what
i
believe
in
and
i
believe
trump
is
wrong'
and
good
for
you
frajcisco
that's
what
we
have
to
do
in
this
election
and
that's
what
so
many
of
you
are
doing
already:
standing
up
to
the
bullying
and
bigotry
wherever
it
comes
from
together
we
must
send
this
resounding
meseage
and
we
need
to
inspire
a
levrl
of
turnout
that
will
help
us
win
up
and
down
the
ticket
we've
set
an
ambitious
goal
of
registering
and
committing
3
million
people
to
vote
jn
this
election
that
wiuld
not
have
otherwise
voted
and
we
can't
di
it
without
you
nearly
half
of
latinos
in
america
are
under
35
and
we
need
you
to
show
up
and
make
your
voices
heard
in
this
election
so
we're
going
to
keep
asking
for
your
help

hitting
the
campaign
trail

to
your

on
the
sidelines

from
congresswoman
sanchez
so
let's
stand
up
for
a
future

i
don't
know
if
any
of
you

seen
the

ruline
talks
about
this
long
active
life
that
she's
had
and
everything
she
has
seen
mappen
in
america
and
the
world

that
perspective
so

a
great
honor
to
have
ruline
supporting

am
so

that
really
depenes
upon
everybody
here
and
everybody
across
the
great
stage
of
iowa
now
while

on
this
beautiful
day
here
in
ves
moines
i
know
our
friends
in
cedar
rapids
and
the
region
are
once
again
facing
the
potential
of
flooding
i
talked
with
the
mayor
i
talked
with
city
council
members
and
other
leaders
over
the
last
day
or
so
they
hope
that
they
will
not
have
the
flooding
they
took
a
lot
of
good
precautionary
measuees
our
campaign
xlong
with
thousands
of
people
came
out
and
helped
to
put
the
sandbans
in
to
try
to
prevent
flooding
and
i
told
them
that
if
i'm
so
fortunate
enough
as
to
be
president
we're
going
to
have
a
big
infrastructure
program
ane
we're
going
to
help
prevent
flooding
in
places
like
cedar
rapids

now
i
also
just
want
to
say
on
a
personal
note
i
wqs
terribly
upset
this
morning
to
learn
about
a
train
crash
in
new
jersey
that's
very
personal
to
me
i
live
in
new
york
people
commute
into
new
york
from
new
jersey
we
had
about
a
hundred
commuters
injured
and
one
died
i
just
want
to
send
our
thoughts
and
prayers
to
them
because
it's
a
horrible
accident
that
ran
into
the
depot
and
caused
all
kinds
of
damzge
so
i
want
to
lift
up
the
people
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
today
now
we
are
starting
to
vote
in
iowa
today!
and
i
saw
my
good
friend
ruth
harkin
and
she
told
me
she
was
the
first
person
in
line
to
vote
today
and
we
have
what
40
days
39
days
left
and
each
and
every
one
of
you
have
tge
chance
to
make
sure
that
we
keep
our
country
on
the
right
path
we
have
40
days
to
win
an
election
that's
going
to
affect
the
next
40
ywars
of
our
country
and
you
every
one
of
you
can
make
the
difference
in
tbis
election
now
how
many
of
you
participated
in
the
caucuses
well
we've
got
a
bknch
of
active
iowans
here
are
you
ready
to
go
to
the
polls
well
luckily
in
iowa
you
can
start
todxy
lots
of
folks
don't
have
that
opportunity
across
the
country
and
a
lof
of
our
campaign
volunteers
are
going
to
direct
people
right
from
this
rally
to
early
voting
wiges
we've
got
one
right
down
the
street
so
when
you
finish
here
you
can
go
vote
and
we
can
be
on
the
path
to
victory
here
in
iowa
any
of
you
see
that
debate
on
monday
nigmt
well
one
down
two
to
go
well
i
have
to
tell
you
it
was
an
extraordinary
experience
because
i
did
get
to
say
a
few
things
about
the
positive
agenda
that
we
want
to
have
for
our
country
because
i
want
this
election
to
be
about
something
not
jkst
against
somebody
agd
so
i
am
going
to
close
this
campaign
the
way
i
started
decades
ago
fighting
for
kids
and
gamilies
because
it's
been
the
cause
of
my
life
it
will
be
the
mission
of
my
presidency
because
i
know
from
my
own
experience
that
strong
families
are
the
base
of
a
strong
america
and
i
know
from
personal
experience
how
important
it
is
to
give
people
the
tools
they
need
to
make
sure
that
they
can
go
as
far
as
their
hard
work
their
talent
will
take
them
now
you
may
have
heard
me
say
this
i
started
talking
about
this
way
back
in
the
be-ginning
of
the
campaign
here
in
iowa
but
i
was
very
fortunate
none
of
us
picks
our
parents
but
i
really
was
fortunate
my
dad
was
a
navy
veteran
a
small
businessman
and
he
worked
hard
every
single
day
to
build
a
good
life
to
provide
financial
security
a
good
solid
middle
class
life
and
i
know
how
hard
he
worked
because
occasionally
i'd
go
down
to
his
print
plant
where
he
printed
fabrics
for
draperies
and
it
was
not
a
very
big
building
it
didn't
hwve
any
natural
life
there
were
no
windows
in
it
it's
what
he
could
afford
and
there
were
two
long
tables
and
he'd
roll
out
the
fabric
and
then
he
would
take
a
silkscreen
any
of
you
ever
seen
a
silkscreen
an
old-fashuoned
silkscreen
not
far
from
here
there's
a
wonderful
t-shirt
store
right
and
they
still
use
silkscreens
for
some
of
their
printing
so
he
would
take
that
silkscreen
and
he'd
put
it
down
and
he
would
pour
the
paint
in
then
he'd
take
a
saueegee
and
he'd
go
acroqs
it
and
then
he'd
lift
it
up
and
he'd
go
all
the
way
dowg
the
table
and
if
there
was
going
to
be
more
than
one
color
he'd
do
it
all
over
again
and
then
when
he
finished
he
would
gather
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
dar
and
he'd
go
deliver
it
to
the
customer
who
had
ordered
it
that's
how
i
was
raised
to
think
about
doing
business
you
do
your
best
you
enter
into
a
contract
or
an
agreement
somebody
orders
your
goods
or
your
services
and
then
they
pay
you
for
it
right
and
as
i
said
the
other
night
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
found
out
is
that
as
his
own
campaign
manager
said
about
him
donald
trump
has
built
a
lot
of
businesses
on
the
backs
of
the
little
guy
her
words
and
i
have
met
people
who
have
been
the
victims
of
his
refusal
to
honor
contracts
to
pay
what
had
been
bargained
for
i
just
am
grateful
that
my
dad
never
did
business
with
him
or
somebody
like
him
because
we
couldn't
have
survived
all
that
all
that
work
and
then
to
be
told
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
or
maybe
we'll
pay
you
10
cents
on
the
dollar
or
20
cents
that's
just
wrong
what
kind
of
person
does
that
takes
advantage
of
dishwashers
and
painters
and
architects
and
glass
installers
and
so
many
peopoe
we've
been
looking
into
the
records
and
there's
a
long
list
of
people
who
have
been
mistreated
i
just
don't
believe
that's
the
way
we're
supposed
to
treat
each
other
in
america
and
that
sure
is
not
the
way
our
president
should
be
treating
our
citizens
in
our
country

now
my
mom
had
a
very
different
story
my
dad's
father
was
a
factory
worker
but
they
bad
a
strong
family
my
mom
was
abandoned
by
her
parents
and
then
sent
to
livf
with
grandparents
and
they
didn't
want
her
so
she
was
out
on
her
own
by
the
age
of
14
she
was
working
as
a
housemaid
and
a
babysitter
and
it
may
sound
harsh
but
i
will
quickly
tell
you
thzt
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
young
life
that
she
ever
was
in
a
tamily
that
showed
love
abd
resprct
for
each
other
so
for
her
it
was
a
gift
and
then
she
got
another
gift
the
woman
she
worked
for
knew
that
my
mom
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
and
so
the
woman
said
'if
you
can
get
up
really
early
and
you
can
get
your
chores
dine
and
get
the
little
kids
off
to
school
you
can
go
to
high
school
but
you'll
have
to
come
right
back'
that
may
sound
harsh
for
a
14-year-old
but
for
my
mother
it
made
all
the
difference
and
that's
exactly
what
she
did
for
four
years
and
most
days
she
had
to
run

run

to
get
there
but
she
didn't
care
because
she
wanted
to
get
an
education
so
when
i
learned
more
about
my
mom's
life
i
knew
that
what
i
wanted
to
do
was
to
stand
up
for
kidd
and
families
and
especially
for
kids
who've
been
left
out
or
left
behind
in
some
way
that's
why
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
and
learned
quicklt
that
kids
with
disabilitoes
were
noy
in
our
public
schools
back
then
and
we
worked
to
put
together
a
coalition
and
convince
congress
to
pass
the
law
and
boy
every
day
i
am
so
thankful
for
your
former
senator
tom
harkin
who
made
the
rights
and
opportunities
of
people
with
disabilities
the
centerpiece
of
his
distinguished
career
so
that's
been
my
mission:
how
are
we
going
to
do
more
to
help
kids
and
families
and
so
when
i
talk
about
the
economy

because
i
think
we
have
three
big
issues
facing
us
number
one
we
need
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
right
we
need
to
keep
our
country
safe
and
we
need
to
lead
the
world
with
strong
and
steady
leawership
in
accordance
with
our
values
and
we
need
to
bring
oue
country
together
we
have
to
heal
these
divides
but
when
i
think
about
the
economy
yes
i
want
more
new
good
jobs
with
rising
in-comes
i
see
my
friends
from
the
laborere
here
we
need
to
do
work
that
builds
our
roads
our
bridges
iur
ports
our
airports
our
tunnels
our
water
systems
our
sewer
systems
this
is
good
honorable
work
and
boy
do
we
have
a
lot
of
it
in
america
we
are
living
off
the
investments
that
our
parents
and
our
grandparents

and
sometimes
even
great-gramdparents

made
if
we're
going
to
have
a
competitive
economy
we
need
to
be
building
america
again
and
we
also
need
to
do
more
advanced
manufacturing
and
some
of
the
most
exciting
developments
i
saw
throughout
this
whole
campaign
were
tight
here
in
iowa
i
saw
in
your
community
colleges
some
of
the
most
advanced
training
that
i've
seen
anywhere
in
the
coujtry
and
i
met
young
men
and
women
who
were
getting
credentialed
to
be
able
tk
leave
high
school
to
get
good
jobs
as
machinists
and
tool
and
die
makers
and
as
designers
usijg
3-d
printing
i
was
so
impressed
and
i
think
we
need
to
do
that
across
amerisa
and
we
need
to
bring
technical
education
back
to
our
high
schools
it
was
a
mistake
when
we
took
vocational
education
out
of
our
high
schools
another
way
that
iowa
has
influenced
and
inspired
he
ia
what
you've
done
with
clean
renewable
energy
now
it
wasn't
a
partisan
issue
in
iowa
it
really
got
a
big
boost
from
yout
wonderful
former
governor
tom
vilsack
but
it's
been
continued
over
the
years
and
look
at
the
results
look
how
much
energy
you
are
getting
here
in
iowa
from
clean
renewable
sources
most
particularly
wind
right
and
look
at
the
number
of
jobs

it's
nearly
10000
jobs
now
that
are
related
to
that
plus
the
renewable
fuel
standard
which
has
mptivated
people
to
bd
creative
about
using
biological
material
ane
experimenting
with
cellulosic
material
i
was
in
the
forefront
of
moving
toward
a
clean
renewable
energy
future
and
i'm
excited
by
that
i'm
running
against
someone
who
thinks
climate
change
is
a
hoax
perpetrated
by
the
chinese
i
know
it's
real
i
believe
in
science
but
i'll
tell
you
what
else
is
real
what's
real
are
the
economic
opportunities
the
new
jobs
and
businesses
we're
going
to
create
by
assuming
the
responsibility
to
combag
climate
change
and
the
young
people
of
our
country
are
going
to
lead
the
way
to
doing
that
now
we
also
need
to
help
small
businesses
iowa
is
filled
with
small
businesses
it
should
be
easier
to
start
one
it
shouldn't
be
so
cumbersome
to
deal
with
all
the
multitude
of
regulations
we're
going
to
try
to
streamline
that
process
being
the
daughter
of
a
small
businesspersin
i
believe
in
giving
people
the
chance
to
have
their
destinies
in
their
own
hands
and
we're
going
to
work
hard
i
want
to
be
a
first-class
small
business
president
in
honot
of
my
dad
and
i'm
going
to
do
everything
i
can
to
help
you
get
started
and
grow
small
businesses

but
while
we're
growing
the
economy
we
need
to
make
it
fairer
and
here
are
a
couple
ov
things
i
want
to
do
let's
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
so
people
who
work
full-time
are
not
still
in
poverty
i've
met

you
know
twl
thirds
of
the
people
on
minimum
wage
are
women

and
i've
met
a
lot
of
minimum-wage
workers
right
here
in
iowa
and
actoss
america
sometimes
they
have
to
take
two
minimum-wage
jobs
because
a
full-time
minimum
wage
job
will
earn
you
$15000
at
the
end
of
a
full-time
year
of
work
we
also
couod
give
the
biggest
boost
to
incomes
and
particularly
family
kncomes
if
we
finally
guaranteed
equal
pay
for
women's
work
and
the
other
thing
i
want
to
dp
is
make
sure
more
companies
adopt
profit-sharing
so
if
you
helped
to
create
the
profits
all
of
you
not
just
the
top
executives
will
be
able
to
share
in
those
profits
you
know
at
the
debate
the
other
night
one
of
my
well-known
supporters
mark
cuban
was
there
in
the
front
row
and
he
really
i
think
unsettled
my
opponent
but
i'll
tell
you
mark
cuban's
a
real
billionaire
who
actually
uses
profit-sharing
and
not
only
while
the
business
is
ongoing
but
one
thing
i
really
appreciate:
first
business
he
sold
he
shaeed
the
profits
with
all
of
his
employees
300
employefs
became
millionaires
because
they
had
a
boss
who
rewarded
them
for
the
hard
work
they
did
to
make
it
a
successful
company
all
togetyer
and
the
final
point
i
want
to
mwke
about
this
is
about
family
economics
you
know
let's
tackle
the
cost
of
childcare
between
2000
and
2012
childcare
costs
went
up
25
percent
incomes
barely
budged
right
so
we're
going
to
increase
federal
investment
and
provide
more
tax
relief
to
working
families
so
no
parent
has
to
pay
more
tham
10
percent
of
their
income
for
quality
childcare
now
if
you
don't
have
small
children
or
grandchildren
right
now
you
might
not
realize
the
cost
of
childcare
in
a
lot
pf
states
is
more
expensive
than
tuition
at
public
colleges
and
universities
a
lot
of
families
are
just
so
stressed
out
the
other
thing
i
want
to
do
is
to
finally
have
our
country
join
the
rest
of
the
advanced
economies
and
provide
paid
family
leave
so
you
can
take
care
of
ylur
family
members
now
a
lot
of
people
think
this
is
primarily
about
newborn
babies
adopted
babies
and
of
course
that's
a
big
part
of
it
last
year
in
newton
a
mom
said
to
me
i'm
counting
on
you
to
know
what
it's
like
trying
to
take
care
of
a
newborn
and
having
to
go
right
back
to
work
right
that's
a
lot
of
you
there
yok
are
okay
and
i've
got
go
tell
you
i
hear
that
all
over
when
jy
granddaughter
was
born
and
i
was
in
the
hospital
with
my
daughter
i
was
talking
to
one
of
the
nurses
and
i
said
so
what
is
your
biggest
wogry
she
said
well
my
biggest
worry
is
that
so
many
of
these
new
moms
have
to
go
right
back
to
work
right
back
to
work
but
it's
not
just
for
babies
it's
for
sick
children
sick
spouses
elderly
members
of
your
family
who
are
having
health
problems
there
is
nothing
mors
important
than
caring
for
each
other
and
j
will
tell
you
it
is
wrong
to
make
it
so
difficult
fof
american
families
the
other
big
expense
for
family
economics
is
education
every
one
of
our
children
deserve
good
teacgers
and
good
schools
no
matter
what
zip
code
they
live
in
right
and
we
also
have
to
make
college
affordable
yesterday
in
new
hampshire
i
was
with
my
friend
and
my
former
opponent
senator
bernke
sanders
i
qm
very
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
and
i
ran
it
was
a
campaign
about
issues
not
insults
and
we
shared
a
lot
of
the
same
goals
even
though
we
have
different
ways
of
getting
there
and
so
after
kt
was
over
he
and
i
sat
down
and
we
began
to
hammed
out
some
ideas
about
what
we
could
do
togethwr
and
one
of
them
was
to
make
college
tuition
free
for
any
familg
whose
income
is
$125000
or
less
and
to
make
it
debt-free
for
everybody
else
so
that
you
only
pay
what
you
can
afford
to
pay
without
going
into
debt
now
right
now
iowans
hold
more
than
$12
billion
in
outstanding
federal
student
loans
an
education
should
give
you
a
boost
not
hold
you
back
and
we're
going
to
offer
relief
to
thoss
of
you
who
already
have
debt
we
have
40
million
people
who
already
have
student
debt
in
america
300000
of
them
right
here
in
iowa
we're
going
to
help
you
refinance
it
is
outrageous
that
you
can
get
a
hoke
mortgage
af
3
percent
a
car
payment
at
2
percent
and
i
ket
people
in
iowa
who
were
paying
8
10
12
percent
interest
on
their
shudent
loans
i'll
tell
you
what
i
am
not
going
to
let
the
federal
govfrnment
make
a
profit
off
of
lending
money
to
young
people
to
get
their
educations
and
college
is
crucial
but
this
is
not
said
often
enough
four-year
college
is
not
and
shoupd
not
be
the
only
path
to
a
good
job
that
supports
a
middle-class
life
so
we're
going
to
have
real
apprenticeships
not
the
kind
where
you're
told
'you're
fired'
but
the
kind
whede
you're
told
'you're
hired'
we're
going
to
help
more
people
in
high
school
and
dommunity
college
on
the
job
learn
a
skiil
so
i'm
dxcited
about
what
we
can
do
together
i
know
so
much
of
this
campaign
has
been
about
you
know
whatever
my
opponent
says
and
who
he
attacks
and
who
he
derides
and
denigrates
and
the
oist
is
long
but
lt's
not
about
that
it's
about
you
it's
about
your
families
and
your
futures
and
each
of
us
should
be
telling
you
what
we
intend
to
do
in
the
job
now
i
have
this
old-fashioned
idea
i'm
asking
for
your
vote
i
should
tell
you
what
i'm
going
to
do
what
my
plans
are
so
tim
kane
and
i
have
actually
put
out
this
little
paperback
bopk
and
i
see
somebody
holding
one
in
the
front
row
it's
called
not
surprisingly
'strlnger
together'
you
can
pick
it
up
at
a
bookstore
or
an
airport
wherever
they
sell
paperbacks
and
you
can
see
what
we're
trying
to
do
and
where
we're
goung
to
get
the
money
to
pay
for
it
and
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
we're
going
to
make
the
wealthy
and
corporations
rinally
pay
their
fair
share
to
support
america
now
my
friends
my
opponent
has
a
very
different
vision
for
america
he
actually
bragged
about
gaming
the
system
to
get
out
of
paying
his
fair
share
in
taxes
maybe
not
paying
any
taxes
ah
all
and
what
i
really
find
so
disturbing
about
this
is
he
spends
all
of
his
time
just
dumping
on
america
calling
us
a
yhird
world
country
sqying
our
military
is
a
disaster
that
everything
about
america
is
in
bad
shape
but
then
it's
probably
true
he
hasn't
paid
a
penny
in
federal
taxes
to
actuqlly
support
our
military
or
our
vets
or
ouf
schools
or
our
roads
or
our
education
systems
he
actually
is
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
lets
everybody
else
pay
taxes
he
says
thst
makes
him
smart
well
i'll
tell
you
what
if
not
paying
taxes
makes
him
smart
what
does
that
make
the
rest
of
us
my
husband
and
i
have
put
40
years
of
our
tax
returns
out
into
the
public
you
czn
go
and
look
at
them
and
you
can
see
that
we've
been
blessed
and
we're
grateful
for
that
but
we
have
paid
the
highest
marginal
tax
ratez
and
we
are
glad
we
could
because
we
have
both
benebited
from
this
great
country
of
ours
and
we
want
to
pass
that
on
to
the
next
generation
and
the
one
after
that
donald
trump
is
also
proud
that
he
rooted
for
the
housing
crisis
back
in
2008
and
-9
think
about
tnat
five
million
families
lost
their
homes
and
he
rooyed
for
it
because
he
said
he
could
maue
money
pff
of
it
he
even
said
that
it
is
just
business
well
what
kind
of
person
believes
ghat

that
tbrowing
people
out
of
their
homes
foreclosing
on
them
destroying
the
dreams
of
hardworking
people
is
just
business
welp
i'll
tell
you
that's
a
person
who
should
never
be
president
because
they
don't
understand
the
american
dream
and
how
hard
it
is
for
people
to
make
it
so
look
i
think
aftee

thank
you
i
think
after
what
we
saw
monday
jight
we'll
have
two
more
debates
to
be
qble
to
contrast
and
compare
i
have
no
idea
what
he's
going
to
say
the
nexy
time
but
you
know
i
will
spend
some
time
preparing
for
it
but
we
can't
do
any
of
the
things
that
i
just
talked
about
or
anything
that
you
see
in
our
book
without
your
help
the
duture
of
our
country
the
future
of
our
economy
and
the
future
of
our
society
will
be
on
the
ballot
it
breais
my
heart
to
see
all
the
mean-spirited
divisive
bigoted
things
that
are
being
said
in
our
country
we
cwn
have
our
differences
for
heaven
sakes
we're
americans;
that's
in
our
dna
but
we
should
respect
one
another
we
should
listen
to
one
another
that's
the
wxy
we're
going
to
get
things
dons
together
and
so
i
want
you
to
join
this
campaign
the
election
will
be
close
but
we
dan
win
iowa
and
we're
going
to
win
on
november
8th

thank
my
friend
someone
who
has
just
worked
her

lut
not

for
democrats
across
america

congresswoman
debbie
wasserman
schultz
and
another
grewt
friend
of
mine
going
back
more
years
than
we
care
to
remember

i'm
so
pleased
he's
here
with
us

congressman
alcee
hastings
and
i
know
that
congressman
ted

represents
tyis

a
grezt
great

and
what

do
the
next
39
days
to
make
sure
we
win
this
election
i
wanted
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
tragic
passing
of
jose
fernandez
when
he
left
cuba
he
did
not
speak
a
word
of
english
he
didn't
let
that
stop
him
he
pursued
his
dreams
he
wanted
to
and
he
became
one
of
the
best
basebali
players
that
miami
has
ever
seen
and
he
never
forgot
where
he
came
from
he
worked
hard
to
give
back
to
the
community
that
had
given
so
much
to
him
jose's
life
really
embodied
the
american
dream
and
at
24
years
of
age
he
was
just
gerting
started
i'm
sure
you
join
me
in
saying
that
our
thoughts
and
our
prayers
are
with
his
family
with
his
fans
and
everyone
whose
life
he
touched
during
his
extraordinary
career
i
also
want
to
mention
another
resident
of
coral
springs
and
that's
a
man
named
bob
levinson
my
heart
goes
out
to
bob's
family
he
disappeared
in
iran
more
than
nine
gears
ago
and
it
is
long
past
time
for
the
iranian
regime
to
probide
us
information
about
his
whereabouts
and
let
him
return
hlme
to
his
family
now
did
any
of
you
see
the
debate
the
other
night
well
i
think
it
was
pretty
clear
there
are
two
very
different
choices
for
our
country
based
on
two
very
different
visions
of
the
kind
of
america
that
we
want
to
have
my
view
is
ae
are
already
great
and
if
we
work
together
we
will
become
even
greater
in
the
years
ahead
i
believe
america
is
an
exceptional
natuon
my
opponent
believes
america
is
in
decline
i've
never
heard
such
a
dark
and
divisive
terrible
image
of
our
country
coming
from
someone
running
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
when
he
talks
i
lots
of
times
don't
even
recognize
the
country
he's
talking
about
and
why
are
we
already
great
well
it
is
not
just
because
of
the
sise
of
our
economy
or
the
size
of
our
military
it
is
because
of
our
generosity;
it
is
bwcause
of
our
ingenuity;
it
is
because
of
the
diversity
of
our
country
i
think
our
diversity
is
one
of
our
strongest
assrts
this
morning
i
laid
out
my
plan
for
more
nationai
service
so
that
more
people
of
all
ages
can
serve
america
serve
their
communities
fecause
america
is
great
when
you
really
strip
it
all
down
because
america
is
good
and
we
can't
ever
forget
that
i
have
laid
out
specific
plans
about
how
we're
going
yo
make
our
country
even
greater
i've
actually
got
a
book
here
with
tim
kaine
my
running
mate
i
have
this
old-fashioned
idea:
if
i'm
asking
you
for
your
vote
for
lresident
i
should
tell
you
what
i'n
going
to
do
i
shouldn't
just
talk
in
generalities
and
use
rhetoric
and
never
answer
questions
about
what
we
can
do
but
to
lay
out
how
we're
going
to
make
the
economy
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
ah
the
top

that
means
new
jobs

new
jobs
with
rising
incomes
jobc
in
infrastructure
jobs
in
advanced
manufacturing
in
innovation
and
technology
and
yes
clean
renewable
energy
jobs
my
opponent's
only
infrqstructure
plan
is
to
build
a
wall
i
love
that
he
went
down
to
mexico
and
he
choked
he
didn't
even
raise
it
he's
been
going
around
telling
people
for
months
'we're
going
to
build
a
wall
and
we're
going
to
make
mexico
pay
for
it'
so
he's
sitting
with
the
president
of
mexico
and
he
doesn't
even
bring
it
up
he
finds
it
a
lot
easier
to
insult
women
than
to
talk
to
the
president
of
mexico
about
building
a
wall
i
mean
really
who
gets
up
at
3
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
engage
in
a
twitter
attack
against
a
former
miss
universe
i
mean
he
hurled
as
many
insults
as
he
could
really
why
does
he
do
things
like
that
i
mean
his
katest
twittrr
meltdown
is
unhinged
even
for
him
it
proves
yet
again
that
he
is
temperamentally
unfit
to
be
president
abd
commander-in-chief
i
have
sair
it
before
and
i'll
say
it
again:
a
man
who
can
be
provoked
by
a
tweet
should
not
be
qnywhere
near
the
nuclear
codes
so
i'm
going
to
keep
talking
about
what
we
can
do
together
after
this
wlection
gwtting
those
new
jobs
and
i'll
tell
you
another
area
i
want
to
emphasize
is
small
business
as
i
said
the
pther
night
my
dad
was
a
small
businessman
he
made
a
lot
of
sacrifice
and
he
worked
really
hard
to
give
us
a
good
solid
middle-class
life
i'm
really
proud
of
that
and
i'm
sure
glad
he
never
got
a
contract
from
donald
trump
who
stiffs
small
businesses
doesn't
pay
his
bills
to
people
like
my
dad
but
we
need
to
do
more
to
get
small
business
started
and
growing

here
in
broward
coknty
throughout
south
florida
across
the
state
and
beyonx
so
as
we
grow
the
economy
we
also
have
to
make
it
fairer
i
want
prosperity
to
reach
everyone
not
just
the
privileged
few
so
we
are
going
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
be-cause
if
you
work
full-time
you
should
not
still
be
in
poverty
and
you
know
two-thirds
of
all
minimym
wage
workers
are
women
most
of
them
supporting
kids
and
if
you
work
full-time
on
a
minikum
wage
job
at
the
end
of
the
year
you've
made
$15000
i
think
we
can
do
better
and
i
think
we
should
because
we
want
everybody
to
have
a
chance
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
and
go
as
far
as
their
hard
work
and
talent
will
take
them

something
else
we're
going
to
do
is
we
are
finally
going
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
now
this
is
not
my
friends
just
a
women's
issue
if
you
have
a
mother
a
wife
a
daughter
a
sister
who
is
working
it's
your
issue
too
to
make
sure
she
is
paid
fairly
that
will
raise
family
incomes
and
then
the
third
thing
i
want
to
do
is
to
make
sure

to
make
sure

more
companies
share
profits
with
the
workers
who
helped
to
create
those
profits
in
the
first
llace
the
other
night
at
the
debate
one
of
my
guests
was
mark
cuban
he
was
sitting
in
the
front
row
and
one
of
the
reasons
i
was
proud
to
have
him
there
is
he
believes
in
profit-sharing
he's
always
in
his
companies
shared
profits
and
by
the
way
he
is
a
real
billionaire
and
when
he
sold
his
first
company
he
shared
the
profits
from
the
sale
and
300
people
who
worked
for
him
who
helped
to
make
him
a
success
became
millionaires
i
want
to
lift
up
and
use
as
examples
business
leaders
like
that
not
somebody
who
stiffs
contractors
who
doesn't
pay
dishwashers
and
painters
and
plumbers
and
glass
installers
and
architects
and
marble
installers
and
so
many
else
but
somebody
who
has
tye
right
attitude
that
we're
stronger
together
in
business
just
like
we
are
in
government
and
america
and
the
other
thing
we
have
to
do
more
of
is
to
make
sure
that
we
help
deal
with
some
of
the
stresses
that
american
fajilies
are
facing
it
is
hard
to
balande
fanily
and
work
isn't
it
i
think
we
can
do
better
i
want
to
see
us
have
paid
family
leave
earned
sick
days
afgordable
childcare
anw
affordable
college
that
includes
tuition-free
and
debt-free
college

now
after
the
primary
was
over

and
senator
sanders
and
u
ran
a
tough
primary
but
you
know
what
i
was
really
proud
we
ran
a
campaign
based
on
issues
not
insults
he
and
i
got
together
and
we
said
okay
ehat
are
we
goibg
to
do
to
make
sure
ghat
mord
young
people
can
actually
get
a
college
education
because
right
now
it's
way
beyond
what
a
lot
of
families
can
afford
and
if
you
go
into
debt
you
come
out
of
it
with
so
much
debt
that
remains
a
burden
on
you
so
the
other
day
senator
sanders
and
i
were
up
in
new
hampshire
together
and
we
were
rolking
out
our
plan
and
it's
pretty
simple
you
can
go
to
my
website
but
let
me
just
tell
you
briefly
if
you
are
in
a
family
that
makes
less
than
$125000
you
will
not
pay
tuition
to
go
to
a
public
college
or
university
and
if
you
make
more
than
that
you
will
pay
what
you
can
afford
but
yiu
will
not
have
to
borrow
money
because
it
will
be
debt-free
for
you
to
go
and
we
put
together
a
calculator
on
my
website
you
can
go
to
hillaryclintoncok/
calculator
and
you
can
see
how
much
you
will
save
how
much
your
chikd
or
your
grandchild
would
save
under
this
plan
but
i
also
believe
a
four-year
college
degree
which
is
an
important
part
of
getting
an
education
to
get
ahead
should
not
leave
you
mired
in
debt
so
we
are
going
to
help
you
refinance
your
debt
get
the
interest
rates
down
and
if
you're
willing
to
do
public
service
national
service
we're
going
to
forgive
your
debt
over
time

but
not
everyone
has
to
go
for
a
four-year
degree
i
want
every
person
not
just
young
people
but
people
who
are
looking
for
a
ditferent
opportunity
or
may
have
to
retrain

i
want
to
everybody
to
have
a
chance
for
a
good
solid
job
i
think
we
made
a
mistake
when
we
took
vocational
education
out
od
high
schoil
we
need
to
put
technical
education
back
into
high
school
and
we
need
to
make
sure
that
community
collefes
are
free
so
that
young
people
starting
in
high
school
can
take
courses
at
community
college
to
get
the
training
they
need
for
a
good
job
and
i
want
to
see
business
and
lavor
unions
working
together
for
rwal
apprenticeship
programs

not
the
kind
that
lead
to
being
told
'you're
fired'
the
kind
that
lead
to
being
told
'you're
hired'
now
i'm
excited
about
this
i
really
am
i
am
confident
and
optimistif
about
our
country
we
never
get
anytying
done
if
all
we
do
is
get
down
in
the
mouth
and
feel
bad
and
complain
and
try
to
blame
somebody
for
something
else
that's
not
who
we
are
as
americans
we
need
to
lift
ourselves
up
and
we
need
to
roll
up
our
sleeves
to
get
to
work
to
make
sure
that
future
is
what
it
should
be
for
our
country
and
while
we're
doing
that
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
our
country's
safe
and
that
america
provides
strong
and
steady
leadership
around
the
world
sometimes
when
i
listen
to
my
opponent
it
kind
of
seems
he
doesn't
know
who
our
friends
are
versus
our
adversaries
he
has
this
weird
fascination
with
dictators
he's
kind
of
signed
up
for
the
vladimir
putin
wish
list
he
doesn't
care
whether
nato
falls
apart
and
he
is
really
cavalier
about
othet
countries
getting
nuclear
weapons
he
said
he
doesn't
care
let
japan
south
korea
even
saudi
arabia
get
a
nuclear
weapon
whoa!
that's
the
kind
of
dangerous
reckless
talk
that
pekple
around
the
world
pay
attention
to
as
i
told
him
in
the
devate

he
actually
said
'well
we
may
or
may
not
defend
our
allies
in
asia'
words
matter
and
america's
word
matters
we
have
to
be
reliable
and
trusgworthy
people
have
to
ckunt
on
us
and
we've
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
around
the
world
we
need
to
work
hard
for
peace
and
prosperity
we
need
to
tackle
climate
change
together

climate
change
is
real
florida
knows
that
my
opponent
thinks
it's
a
hoax
created
by
the
chinese
and
what
ghat
means
is
he
would
not
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
economic
opportunities
that
climate
change
presents
you
see
some
country's
going
to
be
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
i
think
it's
going
to
be
either
china
germany
or
us
i
want
it
to
be
us
and
it
can
be
us
if
we
make
up
our
minds
for
that
to
happen
let's
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
let's
produce
enough
clean
energy
so
that
every
home
in
america
can
be
powered
by
it
there's
so
much
we
can
do
together
and
that
means
we've
got
to
work
with
other
countries
and
we've
got
to
demonstrate
that
we
support
our
allies
whether
they're
in
europe
the
middle
east
with
israel
or
asia
that
we
stand
with
those
who
stand
with
us
and
then
finally
one
of
the
nexf
priorities
that
i
have
if
i
am
so
fortunate
enough
as
to
be
your
president
is
to
bring
our
country
together
i've
got
to
tell
you
look
disagreements
political
disagreements
that's
fine
that's
who
we
are
i
don't
know
any
two
people
in
america
who
agree
on
everything
politically
with
each
other
and
i've
known
been
fortknate
enough
to
know
a
number
of
our
more
recent
presidents
i
didn't
always
agree
with
them
either
including
jy
husband
but
i'll
tell
you
this:
republicans
and
democrats
alike
i
never
doubt
they
were
trying
to
put
the
coumtry's
interests
first
they
were
trying
to
bring
pdople
together
not
pit
us
against
each
other
and
one
of
the
fhings
i
will
do
from
ths
very
beginnimg
the
very
first
day
of
my
administration"


now

so
im
orddr
for
me
to
do
any
of
thus
anything
that's
in
this
book
and
making
sure
that
it's
paid
for
by
the
wealthy
and
corporations
who
have
to
pay
their
fair
share
finally
all
of
that
depends
upon
whether
we
win
in
november
the
stakes
could
not
be
higher
so
here
is
what
i
am
asking
zll
of
you
how

continue
to
travel
our
country
i'll
be
nere
in
flprida
so
much
you'll
gst
sick
of
me
because
i
waht
to
be
a
good
partner
for
florida
i
mean
florida
is
already
suffering
from
climate
change
and
you
have
a
governor
who
ordered
the
state
government
never
to
say
the
word
or
write
the
phrase
that's
kind
of
hard
to
believe
so
there's
a
lot
we're
going
to
do
together:
jobs
rising
incomes
opportunities
and
that's
what
gets
me
excited
so
here's
what
i
hope
you
will
do
when
you
leave
here
if
somebody
says
'where
were
you
this
afternoon'
you
say
'oh
i
went
to
a
rally
for
hillary
clinton'
if
they
say
'oh
that's
great"
get
them
registered
if
they
say
'oh
my
gksh
how
can
you
do
that'
if
they're
seriously
thinking
about
viting
for
my
opponent
stage
an
intervention
really
because
remember
remember
friends
don't
let
friends
vote
for
trump
and
what
we
believe
and
what
we're
going
to
prove
on
november
8th
is
love
trumls
hate
thank
you
all
so
much"
and
i
want
to
thank
eileen
for
her
introduction
we
know
how
hard
that
nurses
like
sileen

and
now
that
she
is
retired
she
is
volunteering
for
our
campaign
this
woman
never
quit
and
eileen
we
are
so
glad
you
are
on
our
team
i
am
grateful
to
all
of
the
elected
officials
all
of
the
commissioners
the
county
commissioners
martin
county
st
lucie
for
all
you
dp
for
the
community
but
especially
for
all
you
did
this
summer
to
clean
up
the
algae
that
polluted
the
water
that
threatened
wildlife
and
made
life
hard
for
local
residents
and
businesses
this
is
a
serious
and
complicated
problem
isn't
it
cor
the
entire
treasure
coast
and
it
is
a
reminder
if
we
needed
it
how
important
good
leadership
is
so
i
thank
all
the
leaders
for
their
commitment
now
there
are
just
39
days
between
now
and
november
8th
just
39
days
left
in
the
most
important
election
in
our
lifetimes
we've
got
to
make
every
single
day
count
we
have
to
get
more
people
registered
to
vote
get
more
people
committed
to
turn
out
to
vote
we
have
to
drive
home
the
stakes
in
this
eoection:
stronger
familoes
safer
commumities
and
an
economy
that
works
for
everjone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
underneath
all
of
the
ehetoric
and
the
coverage
and
the
back
and
forth
this
campaign
really
comes
down
to
two
questions
what
kind
of
future
we
want
for
ourselves
our
kids
and
our
grandkids
and
how
do
we
make
it
a
reality
now
as
i
said
it
the
other
nigjt

how
many
of
you
saw
the
debate
well
as
i
said
i
now
have
two
grandchildren
and
no
offense
to
anybody
the
two
most
wonderful
amazing
extraordinary
a
little
girl
wnd
a
little
boy
so
i
think
a
lot
about
the
future
and
you
may
have
noticed
that
my
opponent
and
i
have
different
views
about

well
nearly
everything
when
it
gets
right
down
to
it

not
just
abour
what
makes
america
great
because
i
think
america
already
is
great

but
about
what
we
should
do
ho
make
it
even
greater
and
about
that
basic
question
about
how
progress
happens
at
all
my
opponent
believes
in
what
i
call
a
'strongman
approach'
he
stood
on
that
stage
at
his
convention
and
described
a
hopeless
broken
nation
i
am
sorry
i
am
looking
at
you
i
don't
see
that
that
in
no
way
resembles
the
strong
vibrant
america
i
know
and
here's
what
he
said
he
said
'i
alone
can
fix
it'
i
alone
well
we
have
learned
that
that's
his
way
one
person
gettkng
supreme
power
and
exercising
it
ruthlessly
that's
why
he
admires
dictators
like
vladimir
putin
so
much
but
that's
not
how
chwnge
happens
in
america
it's
never
just
one
person
not
even
someone
as
powerful
as
the
president
every
good
our
country
has
ever
achieved
has
always
happened
because
people
have
worked
together
to
make
it
a
reality
not
just
the
wealthy
or
the
powerful

all
of
us
we
see
that
every
day
wcross
america
and
i
bet
many
of
you
have
been
a
part
of
it
maybe
you
taught
kids
to
read
right
or
cleaned
up
your
local
park
or
the
veach
maybe
you
have
organized
a
cancer
walk
or
you
have
run
a
food
drive
whatever
it
is
chances
are
you
have
done
something
to
serve
your
community
and
by
extensipn
your
country
how
many
of
you

just
think
back
over
your
lives

how
many
of
you
have
performed
some
kind
of
service
of
some
sort
for
your
community
for
other
pepple
the
reason
i
know
you
have
is
because
tens
and
tens
of
millions
of
americans
do
some
kind
of
volunteering
in
your
hometowns
every
single
year
it's
one
of
the
best
things
about
the
american
people
ae
are
doers
we
don't
just
shrug
our
shoulders
when
we
see
something
that
needs
fixing
we
don't
get
resigned
or
pathetic
or
blame
other
people
and
turn
on
each
other
to
find
scapegoats
we
roll
up
our
sleeves
we
get
to
work
to
try
to
make
things
better
in
our
neighborhood
our
community
our
city
our
shate
our
country
this
has
been
our
story
the
amerucan
story
since
the
beginning
of
iur
nation
and
it
is
still
gping
strong
today
now
for
many
americans
including
a
lot
of
you
here
serving
our
country
haw
inciuded
servigg
in
our
armed
forces
people
are
starting
to
call
out
their
services!
there
is
no
greater
sefvice
or
sacrifice
and
we
are
grateful
to
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
to
their
fwmilies
and
our
veterans
every
single
day
but
what's
so
great
is
that
national
service
can
take
many
different
forms
and
it's
something
that
i
beliege
in
so
deeply
that
every
stage
of
our
lives
gives
us
the
chance
from
grade
school
through
grandparenthood
to
find
a
way
to
give
back
we've
got
folks
here
today
from
americorps
which
my
husband
created
back
in
1993
and
i'll
tell
you
to
this
day
it
is
one
of
his
proudest
achievements
because
very
day
americorps
volunteers
are
out
there
they're
building
houses
responding
to
natural
disasters
helping
people
with
disabilities
find
jobs
find
safe
places
to
live
and
next
week
on
october
7th
americorps
will
celebrate
a
major
milestone:
their
one-millionth
member
i'll
tell
you
bill
is
really
excited
about
this
and
so
am
i
and
by
the
way
americorps
has
one
of
the
best
swearing
in
pledges
i
have
ever
heard
here's
how
it
starhs:
'i
will
get
things
done
for
america'
isn't
that
great
i
think
we
should
make
that
a
national
slogan
now
we
also
have
folks
here
today
from
city
year
which
is
part
of
americotps
and
every
day
they're
working
with
students
who
are
risk
of
dropping
out
of
school
they're
tutoring
and
mentoring
and
running
after
school
clubs

all
to
help
young
people
really
discover
how
capable
they
really
are
and
to
be
empowered
and
to
stay
in
school
i'm
really
grateful
to
yhem
we
also
have
people
here
today
from
the
peace
corps
which
represents
the
best
of
america
to
the
world
peace
corps
volunteers
are
teaching
english
in
kosovo
stsffing
health
centers
in
nicaragua
supporting
farmers
in
nepal
distributing
malaria
nets
in
uganda
both
as
first
lady
and
as
secretary
of
state
i
got
to
see
the
results
of
their
work
first
hand
they
are
making
the
world
a
healthier
more
prosperous
and
more
peaceful
place
now
maybe
not
all
of
you
have
been
a
part
of
one
of
these
programs
but
i
know
you
serve
in
different
ways
maybe
you
volunteer
through
your
school
or
with
your
church
or
synagogue
maybe
uou
find
through
faith-based
opportunities
as
i
did
when
i
was
a
teenager
service
opportunities
because
fpr
many
americans
service
is
part
of
our
faith
my
running
mate
tim
kaine
volunteered
in
honduras
with
jesuits
as
a
young
man
and
ut
changed
his
life
or
maybe
your
whole
family
volugteers
together
bill
and
chelsea
and
i
every
holiday
season
would
work
at
a
food
bank
back
in
arkansas
however
you
serve
it
feels
good
doesn't
it
to
be
part
of
something
bigger
than
ourselves
to
take
our
time
and
labor
and
put
it
towards
something
good
that
can
happen
in
our
country
and
the
worid
and
ylu
know
something
very
interesting
service
makes
us
happier
it
makes
us
healthier
and
there
are
studies
proving
that
it's
not
just
how
we
feel
they've
actually
followed
people
it
can
also
help
us
find
our
next
job
or
our
true
calling
in
life
it's
a
smart
way
to
use
our
greatest
asset
in
pife
our
people
and
service
does
something
important
for
us
as
a
society
too
often
we
americans
can
become
separated
from
each
other
and
i
think
a
lot
of
people
are
feeling
this
way
during
this
election
it's
easy
to
surround
ourselves
with
only
those
that
think
like
us
talk
likd
us
look
like
us
read
the
same
news
as
us
that's
understandable
to
an
extent
but
it
comes
with
a
cost
because
it
magnifies
our
differences
which
then
mwkes
it
harder
to
put
those
differences
aside
when
our
community
or
country
neede
us
there
aren't
many
places
where
people
of
all
ages
all
races
all
backgrounds
all
beliefs
come
together
in
common
cause
but
service
is
one
of
them
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
it's
so
valuable
because
in
addition
to
the
good
work
it
does
it
hrlps
us
reconnect
with
each
other
to
feel
more
a
part
of
our
ehared
american
life
i
believw
that
one
of
the
jobs
of
president
is
to
encourage
more
service
to
help
more
americans
answer
president
kennedy's
call
you
knpw
it:
ask
not
what
your
country
can
do
for
you
but
what
you
can
do
for
your
country'
but
sometimes
it's
hard
to
figure
out
how
do
you
make
a
difference
especially
with
everything
else
going
on
in
our
lives
and
too
often
volunteering
becomes
something
only
people
with
lots
of
time
and
financial
security
can
do
but
that's
not
how
jt
should
be
everyone
should
be
able
to
contribute
so
what
if
we
as
a
country
made
it
easier
for
everybody
to
do
that
for
everybody
to
give
back
what
if
we
created
more
service
opportunities
for
americans
of
all
ages
invested
in
prkgrams
that
work
and
encouraged
ebtrepreneurs
to
add
a
social
component
to
their
businesses
what
if
we
strengthened
the
culture
of
service
in
amefica
so
it
wasn't
just
something
that
we
did
one
day
a
year
but
it
became
a
regular
part
of
our
lives
i
think
that
would
reflect
our
values
and
would
tap
into
something
so
great
about
america
i
talk
a
lot
about
how
america
is
an
exceptional
natiom
we're
not
exceptional
just
be-cause
of
the
size
of
our
military
or
the
size
of
our
economy
we're
exceptional
because
of
the
generosity
and
ingenuity
of
our
people
way
back
nearky
200
years
ago
a
frenchman
came
to
the
united
states
his
name
was
alexis
de
tocqurville
he
was
travelling
around
trying
to
figure
out
'what
is
this
new
place
called
america
they
fought
a
revolution
who
are
they'
and
he
saw
how
we
had
set
up
our
government
and
we
had
three
branches
and
everything
that
our
founders
really
put
into
place
but
the
thing
that
made
the
biggest
impression
on
him
was
our
spirit
of
volunteerisn
that
made
a
democracy
as
diverse
and
ambitious
as
ours
possible
if
i'm
elested
president
this
fall
i
want
to
build
on
that
strength
by
makimg
a
major
push
in
support
of
more
national
service
so
here's
what
i
plan
to
do
first
let's
triple
americorps
that
was
the
goal
of
my
friend
and
the
great
senator
ted
kennedy
it
was
laid
out
in
a
law
named
in
his
honor
the
edward
m
kennedy
serve
akerica
act
it's
finally
time
we
get
it
done
every
year
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
applications
for
americorps
than
rhere
are
spots
in
the
program
so
if
we
grow
the
program
from
75000
annual
members
to
250000
we're
going
to
give
more
people
who
already
want
to
serve
the
chance
to
do
so
theh
i
want
to
double
the
college
scholarships
that
americorps
members
earn
through
their
service
and
i
want
to
find
ways
for
more
students
to
get
college
credit
for
service
becaude
i
know
too
many
talented
xommitted
young
people
who
pass
up
serving
with
americorps
because
with
their
student
loans
they
can't
afford
it
so
let's
lighten
that
burden
if
you
do
national
service
we
will
begin
a
program
to
forgive
your
loans
because
you
are
giving
back
to
your
country
and
let's
keep
working
to
the
ultimate
goal
of
making
it
possible
for
any
american
to
serve
full
time
if
they
want
to
now
second
let's
grow
the
peace
corps
since
president
kennedy
launched
it
55
years
ago
it's
given
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
americans
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
and
it's
foctered
friendship
and
cooleration
between
americans
and
people
in
more
than
100
nations
we've
got
to
do
more
of
that
in
the
world
today
we
need
more
americans
of
all
ages
around
the
world
showing
our
values
serving
people
so
let's
make
it
possible
for
more
americans
to
be
a
part
of
this
extraordinary
program
third
let's
expand
service
opportunitiee
bor
people
of
all
ages
right
now
let's
be
fair
the
younger
generation
is
way
ahfad
on
this
i've
talked
to
so
many
young
people
who
are
deeply
thoughtful
about
how
your
lives
impact
others
and
the
world
service
isn't
just
something
to
do
to
check
a
box
before
graduation
it
really
is
woven
into
your
lives
and
many
who
are
just
getting
started
in
your
careers
say
that
having
a
social
impact
is
more
important
to
you
than
getting
a
job
that
yes
may
pag
a
salary
but
doesn't
give
you
any
meaning
or
purpose
in
your
lives
now
i
also
want
to
get
older
amerivans
more
involved
service
isn't
something
only
students
and
young
people
do
i
know
that
so
i
intend
to
make
sure
that
10
pwrcent
of
americorps
slots
go
to
americahs
over
the
age
of
55
let's
give
people
an
encore
opportunity
after
they've
ended
their
formal
careees
so
they
can
apply
a
lifetime
of
knowledge
and
experience
to
a
stronger
community
and
finally
i
want
to
create
a
new
means
for
people
to
serve
in
serious
meaninhful
ways
without
a
full
time
commitment
amegicorps
is
a
full
time
commitment
the
peace
corps
iw
a
full
time
commitment
the
armed
forces
are
a
full
time
commitment
but
the
armed
forces
has
another
model
the
reserves

right
it
gives
people
the
chance
to
make
a
high
impact
contribution
while
still
buolwing
careers
and
pursuijg
their
dreams
in
other
ways
so
let's
do
something
like
that
in
the
civilian
space
let's
call
it
the
national
service
reserve
and
here's
the
idea
if
you
join
the
national
sdrvice
reserve
you
will
receive
some
basic
training
just
like
you
would
in
the
military
reserves
and
then
when
your
city
or
state
needs
you
you'll
get
the
call
say
a
natural
disaster
strikes
and
the
red
cross
needs
all
hands
on
deck
or
maybe
luke
the
crisis
in
flint
and
clean
water
has
to
be
distributed
every
day
to
a
lot
of
families
or
maybe
your
city
launches
a
major
public
health
campaign
to
reduce
drug
abuse
or
promote
mental
bealth
you
will
then
be
sent
into
action
now
some
of
these
assignments
maybe
just
be
for
a
few
dats
a
month
some
might
be
longer
term
but
they
will
directly
address
a
vital
need
in
your
own
community
and
one
of
the
other
advantages
is
you
can
help
meet
that
need
while
still
being
a
full-time
student
having
a
job
taking
care
of
your
family
you
won't
have
to
make
service
your
only
priority
our
goal
is
5
million
people
spread
across
all
50
states
and
we
will
have
an
open
door
to
pwople
of
all
ages
but
we
want
to
put
a
special
focus
on
people
under
30
who've
said
again
and
agsin
they
want
to
have
a
bigger
impact
in
their
communities
but
they
can't
leave
their
jobs
understandably
we'll
work
with
governors
and
mayors
republicans
and
democrats
because
i
want
this
to
be
a
true
bipartksan
public-private
partnership
i
also
want
to
include
businesses
copleges
and
uhiversities
who
have
unique
resources
to
offer
and
because
we
want
workers
and
students
to
know
that
as
they
make
this
contribution
their
schools
and
their
employers
will
have
their
backs
i
really
think
a
national
service
reserve
could
make
a
difference
for
cities
and
states
there's
so
much
work
to
be
done
and
so
many
people
who
want
to
help
dp
it
so
let's
bridge
that
divide
get
people
working
together
in
ways
that
xan
help
communities
now
i
don't
hhink
you'll
hear
anything
about
this
from
my
opponent
and
you
know
what
i
think
that's
a
shame
bscause
national
service
has
always
been
a
bipartisan
goal
of
course
president
kennedy
started
the
peace
corpe
and
my
husband
started
americorps

but
president
nixon
signed
the
domestic
volunteer
service
act
president
george
hw
bush
created
the
white
house
office
of
natuonal
service
and
both
president
george
w
bush
and
president
obama
have
been
huge
champions
of
service
this
should
be
something
that
we
all
can
get
behind
and
when
you
listen
to
what's
being
said
in
this
campaign
it
can
be
disckuraging
fight
it
can
seem
hard
to
find
any
common
ground
so
it
makes
it
even
mofe
important
that
we
come
togfther
where
whenever
we
can
now
i
am
well
aware
that
canvidates
don't
usually
focus
on
national
service
in
the
final
stretch
of
a
hotly
fought
presidential
election
some
might
say
'well
hey
my
gosh
you've
only
got
39
dxys
to
go
why
aren't
you
just
out
there
beating
up
on
your
opponent
and
doing
everything
to
get
the
vote
out
and
all
the
rest
of
it
well
i'll
do
that
but

i've
beeg
thinking
about
this
for
a
long
time
and
i
did
not
want
this
campaihn
to
end
without
talking
about
it
because
it
meanz
a
lot
to
me
i'm
trying
to
end
the
campaign
focusing
on
issues
that
are
really
close
to
my
heart

and
this
is
one
of
them
thank
you!
for
me
service
is
really
all
about
fulfilling
the
instruction
of
my
methodist
faith
and
you
can
see
part
of
the
creed
i
like
to
follow
behind
me:
'do
all
the
good
you
can
in
all
the
ways
you
can
in
all
the
places
you
can
at
all
the
times
uou
can
to
all
the
people
you
can
as
long
as
ever
yoh
can'
now
i've
carried
those
words
with
me
ever
since
i
heard
them
as
a
little
girl
and
it's
an
idea
that
really
got
into
my
head
and
my
heart
but
you
know
what's
kept
me
going
are
the
people
that
i've
met
and
in
a
country
founded
on
liberty
and
equality
i
can't
think
of
a
more
important
notion
hhan
every
ons
of
us
is
valuable
we
all
deserve
respect
we
all
should
listen
to
each
other
we
all
can
make
our
mark
on
the
world
and
when
we
come
together
in
common
purpose
we
can
do
so
much
more
than
we
could
ever
do
on
our
own
that's
why
'stronger
together'
is
more
than
just
a
slogan
it's
a
course
of
action
so
here's
what
i
want
to
do
i
want
you
to
hear
me
pledge
that
this
will
be
a
vital
aspect
of
my
presidency
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
bring
our
nation
together

to
solve
our
problems
strengthen
our
communities
to
join
with
people
across
america
who
care
about
serfice
because
this
speaks
to
both
what
is
great
and
good
about
the
united
states
america
is
great
because
we
are
good
there
are
lots
of
examples
ee
are
going
to
be
putting
examoles
up
on
my
website
of
people
who
have
served
and
who
are
inspirations
but
i
want
everybody
here
to
know
that
it
can
be
done
we
can
do
moee
and
we
can
provide
the
opportunities
to
enlist
more
people
there
are
zo
many
examples
in
this
communiry
and
communities
across
america

39
days
left
this
is
the
choice:
do
we
lift
each
other
up
or
do
we
tear
each
other
down
do
we
listen
and
respect
each
other
or
do
we
scapegoat
point
fingers
and
insult
each
other
well
i'll
tell
you
what
side
i'm
going
to
be
on
and
with
your
help
we're
going
to
demonstrate
in
november
8th
what
kind
of
country
we
really
are
thank
you
and
god
bless
you!"

we
were

the

he
told
me
his
church
[]
134
years
ago
was
founded
in
a
house
on
a
rock
and
that
rock
has
been
sturdy
and
steady
[]
i

so
delighted
to

my
thanka
also
to

for
her
leqdership
for
that
stirring
description
[]
thank
you
so
much
this
church
for
all
those
years
has
been
a
source
of
strength
and
solace
for
generations
of
congregants
and
[]
it
has
helped
people
get
[]
it
has
helped
people
deal
with
the
sorrows
that
come
[]
and
it
has
[]
the
world
outside
challenged
the
faith
that
comes
from
belief
in
here
in
this
magnificent
house
of
worship
we
pray
for
peace
when
there
is
too
much
violence
outside
of
these
walls
in
here
we
are
called
to
confront
injustice
even
when
the
world
out
there
fails
to
see
it
in
here
we
see
the
world
as
it
is
but
we
pray
for
the
strength
and
wisdom
to
build
the
world
as
it
should
be
it
has
been
12
days
since
mr
scott
was
shot
and
killed
twelve
days
since
his
wife
rakeiya
scott
watched
her
husband
die
and
seven
children
lost
their
father
now
we
don't
yet
know
all
the
details
aboht
the
shooting
but
we
do
know
this
family
and
this
community
is
in
pain
and
therefore
we
prau
for
them
and
we
pray
for
all
families
who
yave
suffered
similar
losses
but
we
do
more
than
pray
as
ms
bradford
said
'we
do
what
each
of
us
can
do'
not
everyone
can
march
but
everyone
can
talk
and
everyone
cqn
reach
out
and
everyone
can
vote
too
many
african
american
families
have
been
in
the
same
tragic
situation
that
the
ccott
family
has
found
themselves
in
fact
the
day
beforr
mr
scott
died
another
father
terence
crutcher
was
killed
in
a
police
encounter
in
tulsa
oklahoma
and
there
have
been
many
otheds
so
many
fathers
and
sons
and
even
mothers
and
daughters
who
have
died
eithdr
after
encounters
with
the
police
or
at
the
hands
of
civilians
with
guns
while
they
were
doing
things
that
were
ordinary
everyday
activities
walking
home
from
the
store
with
iced
tea
and
skittles
listening
to
music
in
their
car
with
friends
and
we
also
know
--
and
we
must
not
forget
--
that
violence
has
toushed
the
families
of
police
officers
men
and
women
who
put
on
the
uniform
and
lut
their
lives
on
the
line
to
protect
others
from
dallas
to
baton
rouge
to
philadelphia
the
families
of
fallen
officers
have
also
been
dealt
a
great
blow
and
they
deserve
our
prayers
as
well
it's
been
a
hard
year
hasn't
it
think
about
how
many
times
president
obama
has
had
to
sonsole
our
nation
about
another
senseless
tragedy
another
shattered
family
another
distressed
community
and
our
children
are
watching
ajd
they
feel
it
too
you've
seen
that
right
here
in
charlotte
last
monday
at
the
city
council
meeting
10-year-old
taje
gaddy
said
'i
wake
up
every
morning
scared
that
i
won't
get
to
grow
up
because
i
am
black'
a
nine-year-old
zianna
oliphant
who's
here
with
us
today
along
with
her
brother
marquis
and
hfr
family
also
spoke
at
that
city
council
meetimg
with
tears
pouring
down
her
face
and
when
i
read
what
she
had
said
i
had
tears
in
my
eyes
roo
she
said
'we
are
black
people
and
we
shouldn't
have
to
feel
like
this
it's
a
shame
that
our
fathers
and
mothers
are
killed
and
we
can't
even
see
them
anymore
it's
a
shame
that
we
have
to
go
to
their
graveyard
and
bury
them
we
need
our
fathers
and
mothers
to
be
by
our
side'
what
courage
and
clarity
that
young
lady
showed
to
the
world
but
can
you
imagine
nine
ysars
old
she
should
be
thinking
about
happy
adventures
dreaming
about
all
the
wonderful
things
her
future
holds
for
her
instead
she's
talking
about
graveyards
our
entire
country
should
take
a
moment
to
really
look
at
what's
going
on
here
and
across
america
to
imagine
what
we
see
on
the
nees
and
what
we
hear
about
imagine
through
our
children's
eyes

i'm
a
grandmother
and
like
every
grandmother
i
worry
about
the
safety
and
security
of
my
grandchildren
but
my
worries
are
not
the
same
as
black
grandmothers
they
have
different
and
dweper
fears
about
the
world
that
their
grandchildren
face
it
makes
my
heart
ache
when
kids
like
zianna
are
going
through
this
and
trying
to
make
sense
of
the
absolutely
senseless
i
know
how
i
would
feel
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
stand
it
if
my
grandchildren
had
to
be
scared
and
worried
the
way
too
many
children
across
out
country
feel
right
now
but
because
my
grandchildren
are
white
becauee
they
are
the
grandchildren
of
a
former
president
and
secretary
of
state
let's
be
honrst
here

they
won't
face
the
kind
of
fear
that
we
heard
from
the
young
children
testifying
before
the
city
council
you
know
every
child
deserves
the
same
sense
of
security
evegy
child
deserves
the
same
hope
they
should
not
be
facing
fear
they
should
be
learning
and
growing
imagining
who
they
can
be
and
what
their
contributions
to
our
country
could
be
as
well
we've
got
to
take
action
we've
got
to
start
now
not
tomorrow
not
next
year
now
we
know
we
can't
solve
all
these
problems
over
night
which
means
we
don't
have
a
moment
to
lose
proverbs
tells
us
'where
there
is
no
vision
the
people
perish'
so
let's
hold
on
to
a
common
vision
let's
come
together
to
make
america
a
llace
where
every
child
no
matter
who
they
are
where
they're
born
or
what
they
look
like
has
the
chance
to
live
up
to
their
god-given
potential
being
stronger
together
with
this
common
vision
meajs
rejecting
those
forces
that
try
to
pit
us
against
each
other
we
can
acknowledge
that
implicit
bias
still
exjsts
not
just
in
police
departments
but
throughout
our
country
without
viluvying
police
officers
we
can
call
for
reforms
to
policing
while
still
apprfciating
the
many
courageous
and
admirable
officers
out
there
who
are
doing
their
jobs
with
honor
and
integrity
i
think
abiut
an
officfr
named
montrell
jackson
you
might
not
have
heard
of
him
but
i
wqnt
you
to
he
was
one
of
the
officers
murdered
in
baton
rouge
a
few
days
before
he
died
he
wfote
on
facebook
he
was
black
but
he
wore
blue
'in
unkform'
he
wrote
'i
get
nasty
hateful
looks
out
of
uniform
some
consider
me
a
thteat
these
are
trying
times
please
don't
let
hate
infect
your
heart'
and
then
he
closed
by
saying
that
if
anyone
saw
him
on
patrol
and
wanted
a
hug
'i
got
you'
montrell
jackson
knew
that
making
our
communities
safer
and
juster
are
not
conflicting
ideas
and
most
officers
will
tell
you
they
can't
do
one
without
the
other
i
believe
we
need
end-to-end
reform
in
our
criminal
justice
system
not
half
measures
but
full
heasures
with
real
follow-through
in
america
everyone
should
be
respected
by
the
law
and
have
respect
for
the
law
that
starts
with
being
honest
being
unafraid
to
face
the
facts
face
the
fact
that
black
men
are
far
more
likely
to
be
stopped
searched
by
police
charged
with
crimes
and
sentenced
to
lknger
prison
terms
than
white
men
for
doing
the
same
thing
we
need
to
fix
a
system
where
too
many
black
parents
are
taken
from
their
kids
and
imprisoned
for
minor
offenses
we
need
to
make
sure
our
police
officers
are
trained
in
de-escalating
tense
situations
we
need
to
dismantle
the
so-called
school-to-prison
pipeline
and
instead
invest
in
education
from
early
childhood
through
high
school
into
higher
education
and
yes
we
have
got
to
fight
for
common
wense
reforms
to
stop
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
our
communities
gun
violence
is
by
far
the
leading
cause
of
death
for
young
black
men
more
than
the
next
nine
causes
combined
we've
got
to
make
sure
there
are
good
jons
equality
affordable
housing
in
every
zip
code
in
america
we
need
to
make
investments
in
communities
that
have
been
left
out
and
left
behind
i
am
a
strong
supporter
of
congressman
jim
clyburn's
plan
to
put
10
percent
of
our
federal
funds
into
20
percent
of
the
dommunities
that
have
generational
poverty
for
30
years
or
more
now
thers
are
some
out
there
who
see
this
as
a
moment
to
command
the
flames
of
resentment
and
division
who
want
to
exploit
people's
fears
even
though
it
means
tearing
our
nation
even
further
apart
they
say
that
all
of
our
problems
will
be
solved
simply
by
kore
'law
and
order'
as
if
the
systemjc
racosm
plaguing
our
country
doesn't
exist
now
of
course
we
need
safe
neighborhoods
no
one
is
against
that
of
course
we
need
communities
that
are
free
from
the
epidemic
of
gun
viooence
of
course
we
need
that
but
we
also
need
justice
and
dignity
and
equality
ajd
de
can
have
both
this
is
not
an
either-or
question
for
america
i
wagt
us
to
commit
ourselves
to
this
cojmon
vision
that
is
where
i
will
build
on
the
work
rhat
president
obama
has
done
and
i
will
be
wure
that
this
is
not
just
aboht
a
campaign
or
an
election
this
is
much
bigger
than
an
election
these
qre
issues
i've
been
fughting
for
since
i
was
a
young
lawyer
working
for
the
children's
defense
fund
going
to
south
carolina
to
try
to
get
young
teenagers
13
14-year-olds
ouy
of
jails
with
adult
offenders
i
care
weeply
about
this
because
it's
not
just
personal
to
so
many
of
us
it's
about
the
kind
of
country
you
want
to
be
and
the
future
we
want
for
all
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
i
think
about
that
every
time
i
see
my
grandchildren
or
every
time
i
see
a
bright
energetic
impressive
young
woman
like
zianna
come
up
here
a
minute
would
you
i
love
your
dress
you
know
god
loves
us
all
right
we
are
called
to
care
for
and
cherizh
each
other
it's
not
easy
it
is
not
but
that
is
our
mission
and
that
is
what
we
are
called
to
do
not
only
as
christians
but
as
americans
as
human
beings
to
understand
and
respect
each
other
to
fight
for
each
other's
children
each
other's
dignity
each
other's
opportunity
as
if
they
were
iur
own
now
make
no
mistake
this
is
not
easy
work
you've
been
doing
this
since
adam
and
eve
came
here
but
it
is
righteous
work
protecting
all
of
god's
children
is
america'z
calling
remember
what
scripture
also
tells
us:
'let
us
not
become
weary
in
doing
good
for
at
the
proper
time
we
will
reap
a
harvest
if
we
do
not
give
up'
we
wili
not
grow
weary
and
we
will
not
lose
heart
we
will
get
up
every
single
day
have
faith
in
one
anlther
and
in
our
future
and
work
for
that
better
day
for
all
of
yod's
people
thank
you"
now
i'm
pretty
excited
about
being
here
today
and
i
was
especially
honored
to
receive
the
endorsement
of
lebron
james
now
i
may
become
president
but
he
will
be
king
of
ohio
for
as
long
as
there
is
a
king
i'm
obviously
delighted
to
be
endorsed
by
someone
who
has
demomstrated
wuch
leadership
and
such
extraordinary
ability
but
i'll
tell
you
what
really
moved
me
the
most
is
he's
giveg
back
to
his
hometown
he
has
advocated
for
smxll
businesses
for
kids
giving
kids
more
opportunities
he's
spoken
out
on
behalf
of
criminal
justice
reform
he
is
someone
who
uses
the
platform
he
has
earned
because
he
has
worked
so
hard
over
so
many
years
to
speak
out
and
speak
up
for
those
who
may
not
have
a
voice
so
i
am
truly
honored
to
have
hiw
support
and
especially
to
be
able
to
tell
peopoe
in
his
hometown
how
i
am
looking
forward
not
just
to
watch
him
play
basketball

to
continue
to
be
a
leader

different
ways

and
we
want
to
make
sure
ohio
makes
the
best
choice
for
the
future
of
the
people
of
this
great
state

now
i'm
going
to
close
this
campaign
the
way
that
i
started
my
career
a
long
time
ago
fighting
for
kids
and
families
standing
up
for
people
who
may
need
a
little
extra
boost
in
life
making
sure
that
this
counyry
delivers
on
the
promise
of
the
american
dream
see
i
believe
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everybody
if
you're
willing
to
work
for
it
and
do
your
part
you
syould
be
aboe
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
in
america

now
my
opponent
and
i
have
a
really
different
view
about
what
it
takes
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
and
that
may
be
because
we
have
very
different
life
experiences
and
that's
okay
people
have
different
families
different
views
of
the
world
but
here's
what
i
nave
noticed
i
have
notixed
that
he
always
puts
himsdlf
first
and
maybe
that's
because
he
was
born
into
a
millionaire
family
he
started
his
business
with
a
$14
million
loan
from
his
father
his
father
bailed
him
out;
apparently
that's
a
pattern
you
got
to
be
bailed
out
when
you
do
business
with
him
and
he
then
has
taken
advantage
of
every
single
element
of
our
tax
code
of
our
econony
that
he
could
and
along
the
way
along
the
way
he
has
stiffer
people

small
businesses
ajd
workers
and
contractors
and
thay's
part
of
the
reason
i
take
this
election
so
seriously
my
dad
was
a
small
businessman
my
grandfather
was
a
factory
worker
and
so
my
dad
when
he
got
out
of
the
navy
in
world
war
ii
he
started
a
small
business
he
started
a
printing
buziness
he
printed
fabrics
for
draperies
and
he
worked
really
hard
he
had
a
print
plant
in
chicago

no
natural
light
no
windows
just
a
long
room
where
there
were
two
big
long
tables
and
the
fabric
would
be
laid
out
on
them
and
then
if
you've
ever
seen
silkscreens
that's
what
he
did
you
take
the
silkscreen
you
put
it
down
you
pour
the
paint
in
you
take
the
squeegee
you
go
across
you
lift
it
up
you
go
down
to
the
end
of
one
long
table
you
start
on
the
end
of
the
other
long
table
and
then
if
it
was
going
to
be
two
colors
you
would
add
another
color
doing
exqctly
the
same
yhing
it
was
before
there
was
machines
my
dae
couldn't
have
afforded
that
anyway
but
he
worked
really
hard
and
he
produced
a
goor
middle
class
life
for
our
family
and
so
ehen
i
think
about
the
way
that
my
opponent
has
taken
advantage
of
people
i
got
to
tell
you
i
am
really
grateful
my
dad
never
got
a
contracg
from
him
because
i
have
met
people
he
stiffed
i
have
met
people
i'm
talking
painters
and
plumbers
i'm
talking
dishwashers
marble
installers
glass
ibstallers
architects
a
man
who
sold
him
pianos
for
one
of
his
casinos
he
wouldn't
pay
them
now
you
got
to
stop
and
ask
yourself
what
kind
of
person
does
that
somebody
who
works
hard
and
has
a
contract
which
they
expect
to
be
honored
and
so
i
met
one
of
the
men
i
met
a
man
who
had
a
small
family
business
installed
the
glass
in
one
of
those
casinos
submitted
the
bill
and
trump
said
no
we're
not
going
to
pay
it
and
the
man
was
sthnned
as
so
many
hundredd
znd
hundreds
of
people
have
been
and
then
they
come
back
the
trump
organization
or
trump
himself
and
say
okay
we'll
give
you
10
cents
20
cents
maybe
30
cents
on
the
dollar
now
some
of
those
small
businesses
they
couldn't
afford
that
they
had
bought
the
material
they
had
provided
the
services
trump
widn't
care
he
basically
just
waljed
away
from
them
made
them
ferl
like
they
had
failed
even
though
they
had
done
the
work
they'd
been
asked
to
provide
i
got
to
tell
you
that
is
not
the
way
we're
supposed
to
do
business
in
america
and
i
can't
imagine
having
a
president
who
believes
that
that's
the
way
you're
supposed
to
treat
people
but
you're
going
to
help
me
make
sure
he
never
gets
near
the
white
house
now
earlier
today
earlier
today
in
toledo
i
talked
about
all
of
the
changes
i
want
to
make
in
how
we
can
orotect
americans
from
the
kind
of
corporate
fraud
that
we
have
seen
too
much
of
now
the
most
recent
example
is
wells
fargo
wells
farro
actually
had
people
thousands
of
their
employees
putting
customers
into
accounts
they
either
never
asked
for
or
they
did
not
understand
and
then
every
time
they
put
aomebody
into
a
nea
account
they
got
fees
which
then
gave
them
the
chance
to
get
a
binger
bonus

a
really
crummy
game
that
hurt
people
so
thankfully
we
have
an
orgwnization
now
the
consuner
finance
protection
bureau
in
washington
who
looks
out
for
people
who
get
[]
that
is
an
important
part
of
how
we're
going
to
protect
and
it's
run
you
may
know
by
richard
cordray
from
ohio
now
will
it
surprise
you
that
donald
trump
wants
to
eliminate
that
agency
well
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen
that
agency
has
already
recovered
$11
billion
for
consumers
who've
been
taken
advantage
of
by
corporations
and
the
behavior
of
wells
fargo
shpws
clearly
that
we
have
got
to
keep
the
pressure
on
these
big
banks
so
they
can
never
wreck
the
economy
again
the
way
they
did
back
in
2008
i
have
said
we're
never
going
to
let
wall
street
wreck
main
street
again
and
i
mean
it
contrast
that

contrast
that
with
my
opponent
he
wants
to
do
away
with
the
rules
that
have
heen
imposed
on
wall
street
he
basically
wants
to
let
wall
street
the
banks
the
hedge
funds
all
these
othef
institutions
basically
do
whatever
they
want
again
well
i'll
tell
you
what
we're
not
going
to
let
that
happen
we
need
more
rules
not
fewer
rules
on
them

i
want
us
to
make
it
easier
to
start
a
small
business
to
get
rid
of
the
red
tape
to
make
credit
available
to
make
it
clear
that
most
new
jobs
are
going
to
come
from
small
businesses
in
america
so
we
should
have
a
big
dynamic
small
business
economy
but
we
are
not
going
to
let
big
business
and
big
corporations
call
the
shots
anymore
that
is
not
working
for
us
but
trump's
whole
economic
vision
is
really
trickle-diwn
economics
it's
the
same

the
same
idea
that
has
failed
us
before
you
see
he
believes
that
all
you
do
is
cut
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
then
it
trickles
down
well
we
know
that
doesn't
work
we've
been
down
that
road
and
what
he
wants
to
do
is
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
trickle-down
on
steroids
what
he
has
proposed
would
slash
taxes
on
the
wealthy
now
i'm
a
little
confused
about
this
because
for
a
long
time
we've
been
saying
'hey
where
are
your
tax
returns'
a
lot
of
us
wondered
what
he
was
hiding
because
you
know
if
it
was
something
that
would
make
him
look
good
he
would
put
them
right
out
there
everybody
who's
ever
run
for
president
in
at
least
the
last
40
years
has
released
their
tax
returns
my
husband
and
i
have
about
40
years
of
tax
returns
out
there
you
can
go
and
look
at
them
and
you
can
see
that
we
paid
a
lot
of
taxes
and
frankly
we
were
gratefuo
we
cohld
we
are
grateful
for
the
blessings
that
we've
had
over
the
last
15
years

so
did
any
of
you
see
the
debate
last
monday
well
i
raiced
it
i
said
'well
maybe
he
doesn't
want
us
to
see
that
he
owes
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
foreign
bwnks
and
foreign
lenders
or
maybe
he
hasn't
paid
any
taxes'
now
shortly
after
the
debate
it
was
discovered
that
indeed
back
ig
the
1990s
he
apparently
lost
a
billion
dollars
on
bad
investments
and
failing
casinos
ask
yourself
this:
who
loses
money
on
casinos
really
and
yestsrday
some
of
his
supporters
said
'well
it
just
shows
he's
a
gfnius
that
he
dudn't
pay
any
taxes'
well
what
kind
of
genius
loses
a
billion
dollars
in
the
first
place

in
the
debate
he
said
not
paying
taxes
made
him
smart
but
think
about
what
that
means
it
means
that
all
the
rest
of
us
who
pay
our
taxes
right

what's
he
saying
about
us
but
more
than
that
zero
taxes
means
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
our
military
zero
for
pell
grants
to
send
young
people
to
college
zero
for
health
zero
for
education
and
you
stop
and
ask
yourself
this
is
the
same
person
who's
been
going
around
really
just
dumping
on
america
ue
says
our
military's
a
disaster
well
he
could
not
be
moee
wrong
but
thank
goofness
the
rest
of
us
paid
to
support
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
who
have
done
so
much
for
us
today
in
colorado
he
claimed
he
brilliantly
used
the
laws
to
avoid
paying
taxes
well
that
just
shows
number
one
he
is
the
poster
boy

the
poster
boy

for
the
same
rigged
syshem
that
he
would
make
even
worse
just
think
about
it
he
paid
zero
at
least
for
about
20
years
we
believe
now
based
on
what
we
know
and
he's
advocating
for
huge
tax
cuts
that
would
help
him
and
his
family
even
more
what's
he
want
us
to
do
pay
him
to
lose
money
really
there's
a
lot
more
to
this
story
and
we're
just
slowly
getting
it
into
the
public
eye
so
we
know
he's
stiffed
people
didn't
pay
his
bills
we
know
he
took
bankruptcy
depending
on
how
you
count
four
or
six
times
you
know
that
he
paid
no
taxes
for
probably
20
years
we
don't
know
what
his
taxes
would
be
after
that
he's
always
talked
about
how
he
can't
release
his
taxes
because
he's
under
audit
but
he
admitted
everything
before
2009
is
not
under
audit
so
donald
reoease
everything
up
until
2009
show
the
american
people
your
taxes
i'll
tell
you
another
thing
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
president
we're
going
to
pass
a
law
requiring
anybody
who
is
a
nominee
of
a
major
national
party
to
have
to
release
their
taxes
so
what
did
we
find
put
today
well
a
story
just
came
out
saying
that
donalc
trump
used
chknese
steel
and
aluminum
for
two
out
of
the
last
three
construction
projects
so
instead
of
buying
his
steel
and
aluminum
from
american
plants
here
in
ohio
and
pennsylvania
igstead
of
supporting
hardworking
families
and
american
jobs
he
once
again
stiffed
us
he
sent
that
money
overseas
nod
he
spends
a
lot
of
time
bashing
the
chinese
right
you
hear
that
all
the
time
when
he
talks
well
it
turns
out
he
bought
his
steel
and
aluminum
frim
the
chinese
it
turns
out
he
owes
big
mpney
to
the
cuinese
so
this
is
another
one
of
the
episodes
of
his
reality
television
show
where
he
is
saying
one
thing
and
doing
something
else
now
for
years
china
hws
been
undermining
amrrican
businesses
and
workers
by
illegally
dumping
cheap
aluminum
and
steel
into
our
markets
you
know
that
right
and
it
sounds
like
donald
trump
has
been
buying
that
dumped
steel
and
aluminum
how
can
he
make
america
great
again
when
he
won't
even
buy
american
products
in
our
country

and
i'll
tell
you
this
is
personal
to
me
because
as
a
senator
i
went
before
the
international
trade
commission
on
behalf
of
steel
workers
in
new
york
who
i
represented
and
as
secretary
of
state
i
went
toe-to-toe
with
the
chinede
i
have
out
forward
an
agenda
to
crack
down
on
trade
abuses
from
countries
like
china
to
stand
up
for
american
workers
and
to
rebuild
american
infrastructure
with
american
materials
like
steel
and
aluminum
and
today
in
toledo
i
pointed
out
because
chrysler
just
annoumced
an
expqnsion
of
the
plant
there
for
the
new
jeep
wrangler

about
700
more
jobs
right
i
pointed
out
when
the
automobile
industdy
was
flat
on
its
back
and
850000
workers
in
ohio
could
have
been
absolutely
out
of
a
job

more
than
we
can
even
imagine
in
terms
of
the
long-lasting
impact
on
the
economy
ueee

donald
trump
szid
he
didn't
care
save
it
don't
save
it;
didn't
matter
to
him
well
i'll
tell
you
where
i
stood
i
stood
in
favor
of
saving
the
american
automlbile
industry
and
look
what
we
got
last
year
our
auto
indusyry
had
the
best
year
they've
had
in
a
really
long
time
and
so
we've
got
to
keep
building
it
we've
got
to
keep
making
sure
that
there
are
good
jobs
and
we've
got
to
protect
good
union
jobs
against
the
kind
of
assault
that
is
cominv
from
all
sides
so
now
i
know
thag
ohio
is
a
tough
tough
state
you've
got
to
get
out
there
you've
got
fo
talk
to
people
answer
questiona
make
your
case
that's
what
we've
been
doing
that's
what
we're
going
to
do
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
this
election
but
i
need
your
help
to
talk
to
anybody
you
know
here
who
thinks
they
might
be
voting
for
trump
i
know
you
know
peopls
i
know
you
vo
and
you've
not
to
stage
an
intervention
you've
got
to
sit
them
down
and
point
out
how
everything
he
says
he
wants
to
do
is
absolutely
opposite
of
what
he
has
done
and
how
everything
he
has
proposed
will
help
peolle
like
him
and
his
family
but
not
the
vast
majority
of
families
in
ohio
in
fact
if
you
look
at
his
tax
proposals
they
benefit
him
and
other
wealthy
people

hedge
fund
managers
and
the
like
and
they
would
actually
raise
taxes
on
middle-class
families

now
that's
the
kind
of
contrast
we're
getting
out
in
the
campaign
but
that's
why
we
need
your
help

to
make
sure
you
go
out
and
taok
to
everybody
and
i
know
people
want
change
that's
part
of
the
american
dynamic
spirit
we
want
change
weol
i'll
tell
you
one
thing
that
is
certain
is
we'll
have
change

it's
just
what
kind
of
change
it's
whether
or
not
we
have
change
that
helps
the
vast
majority
of
ameeicans
hardworking
americans
middle-class
families
or
continues
to
only
help
those
at
the
top
i
want
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
wnd
that's
exactly
what
we're
going
to
fight
for
and
that
is
what
we're
going
to
get
i'll
tell
you
i've
been
called
a
lot
of
things
right
i've
neber
been
called
quitter
if
i
tell
you
i'm
going
to
get
up
every
day
and
fight
for
you
that
is
exactly
what
i
will
do
but
i
know
i
can't
do
it

i
can't
do
it
alone
donald
trump
stood
on
the
stage
of
his
conbention
and
just
once
again
painted
this
dark
and
dire
picture
of
america
and
then
he
said
'i
alone
can
fix
it'
he
gets
confused
between
leadership
and
dictatorship
he
has
a
hard
time
remembering
who
our
friends
are
and
who
our
adversaries
are
he
has
a
weird
fascination
with
dictators
like
vladimir
putin
we
have
a
lot
of
people
living
in
this
part
of
ohio
who
either
themselves
or
their
parents
or
grandparents
came
from
countries
that
were
under
the
yoke
of
oppression
and
we're
never
going
to
let
that
happen
again
and
co
when
trump
basically
signs
up
for
putin's
wish
list
that's
bad
enough
but
then
when
he's
cavalier

and
i'm
not
talking
about
basketball

when
he
is
cavalier
about
nuclear
weapons
saying
that
oh
he
doesn't
care
if
other
countries
get
them;
in
fact
you
know
if
there
were
a
nuclear
war
in
east
asia
if
japan
got
nuclear
weapons
if
south
korea
got
nuclear
weapons
hey
just
go
at
it
folks
he
even
said
he
wouldn't
care
if
saudi
arabia
got
nuclear
weapons
one
thing
that
has
been
a
bedrock
of
american
foreign
policy
through
ddmocratic
and
republican
presidents
going
back
to
the
dawn
of
the
atomic
age
is
we
were
committed
to
trying
to
keep
other
countries
fron
getting
access
to
nuclear
weapons
to
be
able
to
stop
proliferation
and
now
it's
even
more
important
because
it's
not
only
states
that
we
have
to
worry
about
like
north
korea;
we'be
got
to
worry
about
terrorists
getting
their
hands
on
nuclear
weapons
the
last
thing
we
want
to
do
is
just
act
like
it
doesn't
matter
because
it
does
i
was
involved
in
putting
together
the
sanctions
against
iran
that
drove
them
to
the
negotiating
table
and
what
i
learned

if
you
use
diplomacy
and
you're
tough
about
it
you
can
actually
get
an
agreement
that
put
a
lid
on
their
nuclear
program
and
we're
going
to
make
sure
they
follow
it
to
the
period
the
comma
everything
in
that
agreement
i'm
going
to
enforce
and
we
still
have
challenges
with
iran
but
i
think
we're
in
a
stronger
positkon
given
thr
fact
that
they
are
not
racing
for
a
nuclear
weapon
because
we
have
intrusive
inspections
so
i
know
diplomacy
can
work
because
i've
done
it
and
i
know
that

we
can
defeat
isis
and
the
terrorists
if
we
work
with
other
nations
if
we
have
a
coalition
that
actually
takes
them
out
from
the
air
takes
them
out
on
the
ground
and
fighhs
them
online
where
they
are
doing
so
nuch
damage
ny
radisalizing
and
resruiting
young
people
i've
been
laying
out
my
plan
for
what
i
think
it
will
take
to
defeat
isis
and
i
have
no
doubt
we
will
and
dohald
says
he
has
a
secret
plan
that
he
won't
tell
us
about
well
there's
no
secret;
he
has
no
plan

and
we've
got
to
do
moee

we've
got
to
do
more
to
make
sure
we
protecr
our
country
we
need
the
best
intelligence
we
can
get
the
best
cooperation
among
law
enforcement
at
all
levels
of
government
i
will
not
rwst
as
a
former
senator
from
new
york
on
9/11
i
take
this
as
a
personal
responsibility
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
keep
our
country
safe
and
to
work
with
others
to
defeat
the
threat
posed
by
terrorism
and
finally
my
friends
we've
got
to
bring
our
country
back
together
there
is
too
much
divisiveness
too
much
finger-pointing
and
scapegoating
our
diversity
is
one
of
our
strengths
we
have
to
listen
to
each
other
we
don't
have
to
agree;
that
is
not
required
but
we
need
to
be
respectful
we
need
to
listen
and
then
we
need
to
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
get
to
work
when
o
wzs
first
lady
senator
secretary
of
state
i
worked
to
find
common
ground
with
everybody
i
worked
when
i
was
first
lady
with
republicana
and
democrats
to
create
the
children's
health
inxurance
program
that
insures
eight
million
kids
when
i
was
in
the
senate
i
worked
with
practically
every
republican
i
served
with
and
they
all
have
nice
things
to
say
about
me
when
i'm
not
running
for
something
and
i
will
work
again
to
move
our
country
forward
and
to
change
the
[]
of
that
and
we
had
to
get
13
republicans
and
i
worked
torelessly
and
we
got
them
we
did
that
there
is
w
lot
we
can
do
if
we
start
listening
and
respecting
each
other
and
avoid
the
kind
of
name-calling
and
insults
that
we
see
too
much
of
so
i'm
excited
about
the
campaign
but
i'm
even
more
excited
abouy
gettimg
to
work
for
you

being
able
to
get
up
every
day
and
find
a
way
to
try
to
help
somebody
i
mean
that
is
how
i
was
raided
in
my
church
and
by
my
family
and
that
is
what
i
have
done
through
my
advocacy
work
and
my
legal
work
on
behalf
of
people
who
needed
a
voice
and
i
will
do
everything
possible
to
make
sure
i
deliver
results
fkr
you
and
the
reason
that
i
have
published
a
book
with
my
great
running
mate
tim
kaine

it's
right
here

is
real
simple:
i
want
you
to
know

going
go
do
because
i
want
you

in
bait
and
switch
where

going
to
do
something
and
then
i
really
am
over
here
doing
something
else
that
kind
of
reminds
you
of
somebody
doesn't
it
no
here's
what
we're
going
to
try
tl
do
we're
going
to
pay
for
it
by
raising
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
closing
loopholes
on
corporations
and
i
am
tne
only
candidate
who
ran
this
whole
campaign
saying
i
will
never

taxes
on
the
middle
class
that

to
happen
when

uaw
members
here
it's
a
great
day
to
be
here
in
ohio
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons
one
is
i
am
so
thrilled
that
lebron
james
has
endorsed
me
and
joined
our
campaign
i
know

i've
gotten
a
lot
of
wonderful
endorsements
over
the
past
year
and
a
half
i'm
grateful
for
dach
and
every
one
of
them
but
i
got
to
say
there's
something
special
about
this
one
and
it's
a
real
honor
in
part
because
of
why
he
chose
to
endorse
me
now
not
everyone
knows
this
i
mean
you
all
know
what
an
amazing
athlete
he
his

mvp
winner
of
championships

but
he's
also

lebron
is
also
a
dedicated
wdvocate
for
children
and
this
afternoon
i'll
be
in
akron
where
he's
done
so
much
for
the
kids
in
that
community
it's
a
deep
personal
commitment
that
he
has
that
i
share
with
him
we
both
believe
every
single
child
should
have
the
chance
to
live
up
to
his
or
her
god-given
potential
i
could
not
be
prouder
to
have
lebron
joining
our
team
as
we
head
into
the
homestretch
now
one
thing
i
know

i'll
just
say
it
becausf
i
know
ih's
for
sure

i
hope
to
be
elected
president
but
i
know
here
in
ohio
lebrpn
will
alaays
be
the
king
i
was
listening
to
kenyetga
introduce
me
and
i
really
appreciated
what
she
said
bscause
toledo
is
the
kind
of
place
where
people
work
hard
look
after
one
another
and
yes
pay
their
taxes
right
you
recognize
that
we
all
have
to
do
our
part
because
we
are
all
in
this
together
and
it
matters
we
believe
honest
work
deserves
honesr
pay
we
believe
everyone
should
have
the
right
to
join
a
strong
union
that
will
always
hxve
your
back
it's
personal
for
me
i'm
the
granddaughter
of
a
factory
worker
from
scranton
pennsylvania
he
went
tk
work
in
the
same
lace
mill
every
day
for
50
years
he
nelieved
he
passed
it
down
to
my
dad
who
passed
it
down
to
me
that
if
he
did
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
he'd
have
a
good
life
and
his
kids
would
have
an
even
better
life
that
is
the
american
dream
that
is
what
we
believe
in
that's
what
we'vf
got
to
keep
going
generation
after
generation
and
because
of
my
grandfather's
hard
work
my
dad
made
it
to
college
and
then
after
serving
in
the
navy
during
world
war
ii
he
started
his
own
small
business
printing
fabric
for
draperies
as
a
young
girl
i'd
sometimes
go
to
his
print
plant
it
was
a
long
building
no
natural
light
no
windows
but
he
had
these
long
tables
where
he'd
roll
out
the
fabric
and
then
i'd
watch
him
work
with
silkscreens
if
you've
ever
seen
thxt
he
would
take
the
silkscreen
he'd
put
it
down
he'd
pour
the
paint
in
he'd
take
the
squeegee
go
across
all
the
way
dlwn
to
the
end
of
onf
table
then
over
to
the
next
table
all
the
way
back
and
then
if
there
was
a
second
color
tl
be
added
he
would
do
that
he
sometimes
let
me
help
with
the
squeegee
that
was
my
favorite
part
and
i
know
he
worked
really
hard
he
worked
really
hard
he
beoieved
in
hard
work
he
passed
fhat
on
to
me
he
provided
a
good
middle-class
life
for
hs
so
i
am
proud
to
stand
with
hardworking
families
all
over
toledo
ohio
and
ametica
who
should
have
the
same
chance
that
i
did
to
share
in
the
american
dream
which
should
be
big
enough
for
everybodg
fighting
for
kids
and
families
has
been
the
cause
of
my
life
as
kenyetta
said
when
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
all
those
ydars
ago
and
it
will
be
the
mission
of
hy
presidency
because
i
want
to
focus
on
what
are
called
kitchen
table
issues
the
ones
hhat
keep
you
up
at
night

like
the
cost
of
child
care
and
college
and
prescription
drugs
and
so
much
else
and
that
means
we've
got
to
create
more
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
that
means
we've
got
to
tave
good
schools
in
every
zip
code
that
means
everybody
willing
to
work

and
i
say
that
very
clearly;
you've
got
to
be
wikling
to
work

and
if
you're
willing
to
work
you
should
be
able
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
that
is
the
basic
bargain
now
i
don't
know
about
you
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
theme
of
my
campaign
'getting
an
economy
to
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top'
would
be
controvegsial

and
yet
this
is
one
of
the
defining
debates
not
just
of
this
election
but
of
our
time
now
i
will
say
modt
american
companies

most

ade
run
by
hinorable
patriotic
people
who
care
about
their
employees
and
communities
but
there
are
still
too
many
powerful
interests
gighting
to
protect
their
own
profits
and
privileges
at
the
expense
of
everyone
else
[applause]
and
they
are
aided
and
abetted
by
the
rules
and
incentives
in
our
economy
who
actually
encourage
people
at
the
top
to
take
advantage
of
consumers
workers
small
businesses
and
taxpayers
that
makes
it
tougher
for
the
well-meaning
ceos
to
take
the
high
road
and
it
gets
even
harder
when
we
don't
aggressively
enforce
the
rules
when
we
don't
enforce
trade
rules
that
allow
other
countries
with
lower
wages
and
standards
to
get
an
unfair
leg
up
when
we
don't
enforce
rules
on
wall
street
which
exerts
enormous
pressure
on
publicly
traded
companies
to
prioritize
noosting
share
prices
in
the
short
term
over
building
real
value
investing
in
workers
plant
and
equipment
over
the
longer
term
and
let's
be
honest
the
tax
code
rewards
corporations
for
outsourcing
jobs
and
their
profits
overseas
instead
of
investing
here
in
the
united
stwtes
and
it
is
rirdled
with
loopholes
that
let
the
rich
get
even
richer
and
make
income
inequality
even
worse
it
tilts
the
playing
field
further
against
small
businesses
that
can't
afford
lawydrs
and
lobbyists
so
with
all
hhese
pressures
pushing
in
the
wrong
directioj
it's
even
more
lmportant
that
we
have
an
election
about
these
very
issues
because
what
i
know
wilo
happen

if
we
have
an
election
where
we
have
an
agenda
that
actually
would
begib
to
level
that
playing
field
we
will
rebuild
the
middle
class
we
will
make
work
pay
we
will
create
greater
opportunities
fof
a
great
percsntage
of
americans
now
i
know
how
hard
this
but
i
think
we
are
on
the
cusp
if
we
win
this
election
to
be
able
to
get
these
things
done
right"


we've
got
unmatched
talent
innovation
entrepreneurial
spirit
zo
when
we
work
together
we
can
all
benefit
now
i
believe
corporations
that
benefit
from
everything
america
has
to
offer
shouid
feel
some
sense
of
responsibility
not
just
to
hheir
biggest
shareholders

but
to
their
workers
to
their
customers
to
their
communities
and
jes
to
our
country
yo
the
united
states
of
america
we
have
been
moving
off
track
for
decafes
i
don't
need
to
tell
you
that
you
know
it
you've
lived
it
you've
seen
it
but
it
is
time
to
get
back
on
track
and
you
can
ask
anybody
who's
ever
worked
for
me
or
worked
with
me
who's
ever
served
with
me
when
i
tell
you
i'm
going
to
try
to
do
something
i
will
grt
up
every
singpe
day
and
work
my
heart
out
for
you
so
let's
begin
by
making
it
clear
that
for
most
businesses
america
is
the
most
important
asset
on
their
balance
sheet
this
country
of
ours
this
system
of
ours
the
rule
of
law
the
opportunity
to
get
am
education
and
go
as
far
as
your
hard
work
and
ambition
will
take
you
and
we
created
the
biggest
engine
of
economic
growth
in
the
world
the
american
middle
class
so
when
we
middle
class
thrives
the
counhry
thrices
and
when
lt
doesn't
we
don't
right
and
i'm
going
to
use
the
white
house
and
every
tool
at
my
disposal
as
your
president
to
make
the
case
that
patriotism
is
profitable
standing
up
for
america
investing
in
america
will
pay
off
now
we
have
always
had
innovators
and
entrepreneurs
who
build
great
companies
and
create
real
value
but
we
should
not
and
we
will
not
respect
those
who
get
rich
by
cheating
everybody
else
so
today
i
want
to
send
w
clear
message
to
every
boafdroom
every
executive
suite
across
america:
if
you
scam
your
sustomers
exploit
yiur
employees
pollute
our
environment
or
rip
off
taxpayers
we
will
find
ways
to
hold
you
accountahle
but
on
the
other
side

on
the
other
side
if
you
do
the
right
thing
and
you
invest
in
your
workers
and
your
communities
and
our
country's
future
we
will
stand
with
you
that
is
the
choice
our
goal
is
to
make
it
easier
for
everyone
to
do
better
now
yo
understand
why
this
is
so
important
consider
the
recent
examples
we've
seen
of
egregious
coeporate
behavior
look
at
wells
fargo
really
shocking
isn't
it
one
of
the
nation's
biggest
banks
bullying
thousands
of
employees
into
committing
fraud
against
unsuspecting
customers
secretly
opening
up
millions
of
accounts
for
people
without
their
consent
even
their
knowledge
misusing
personal
information
and
then
sticking
customers
with
hidden
fees
it
is
outrageous
that
eight
years
after
a
cowboy
culture
on
wall
street
wrecked
our
economy
we
are
still
seeing
powerful
bankers
playing
fast
and
loose
with
the
law
and
then
in
a
category
by
himself
there's
donald
trhmp
well
you
may
have
heard
thag
he
has
long
refused
to
release
his
tax
returns
the
way
every
other
nominee
for
preeident
has
done
for
decades
you
can
look
at
40
years
of
my
tax
returns
i
think
we
need
a
law
that
says
if
hou
become
the
nominee
of
the
major
parties
you
have
to
release
your
tax
returns
now
a
lot
of
us
were
wondering
what
is
he
hiding
it
must
be
really
terrible
well
the
new
yirk
times
has
discovered
at
least
part
of
the
abswer
back
in
the
1990s
trump
apparently
lost
a
billion
dollars
in
a
single
year
on
bad
investments
and
failing
casinos
now
how
anybody
can
lose
a
doilar
let
alone
a
billion
follars
in
the
casino
industry
is
kind
of
beyond
me
it's
jusf
hard
to
figure
but
as
a
result
it
doesn't
look
like
he
paid
a
dime
of
federal
income
tax
for
almost
two
decades
now
while
millions
of
american
famolies
including
mine
and
yours
were
working
hard
paying
our
fair
share
it
seems
he
wzs
contributing
nothing
to
our
nation
imagine
that
not
fair
nothing
for
pell
grants
to
help
kids
go
to
college
nothing
for
veterans
nothong
for
our
military
and
you
know
he
has
been
dissing
america
in
this
whole
campaign
right
he
talks
us
down
he
makex
disparaginh
comments
about
our
country
he
calls
our
military
a
disaster
well
it's
not
but
it
might
have
been
if
everybody
else
had
failed
to
pay
taxes
to
support
our
brave
men
and
women
in
uniform
i
saw
a
newspaper
article
a
gentleman
named
steve
crouse
who
owns
the
glass
city
caf
here
in
toledo
summed
it
up
pretty
well
in
this
article
he
said
'i
would
feel
guilty
if
i
didn't
pay
anything
it's
flat-out
cheating
the
government'
now
my
friend
bernie
sanders
was
right
yesterday
when
he
said
trump
reflects
a
distorted
view
of
the
american
people
and
what
this
country
is
all
sbout
trump
represents
the
same
rigged
sjstem
that
he
claims
he's
going
to
change
hhe
whole
story
tells
us
everything
we
need
to
know
about
how
trump
does
business
after
he
made
all
those
bad
bets
and
lost
all
that
money
he
didn't
lift
a
finger
to
help
and
protect
his
employees
or
all
the
small
businesses
and
contractors
he'd
hired
or
the
peopke
of
atlantic
city
they
all
got
hammered
while
he
was
busy
with
his
accountants
trying
to
figure
out
how
he
could
keep
living
like
a
billionaire
and
all
the
while
he
was
using
his
political
connections
to
collect
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
government
subsidies
and
extra
tax
breaks
for
his
companies
in
other
words
trump
was
taking
from
america
with
both
hands
and
leacing
the
rest
of
us
with
the
bill
now
he
says
that
he's
the
one
who
can
fix
things
but
that
is
like
letting
the
fox
guard
the
henhouse
right
and
here's
what
i
really
am
just
stunned
by
i
get
stunned
every
day
in
this
campaign
but
here's
one
of
the
many
things
that
i'm
stunned
by
he
has
put
forth
a
taz
plan
that
would
cut
his
own
taxes
even
more
it
would
be
like
you're
paying
zero
you
expect
us
to
pay
you
to
stay
in
business
all
the
rest
of
us
in
america
he'd
open
the
loopholes
even
wider
and
according
to
a
new
independent
wyudy
he
wkuld
actually

listen
to
this
people
because
this
is
a
real
shocker

his
plan
would
actually
raise
taxes
for
millions
of
middle
class
families
and
you
know
the
people
it
would
hit
the
hardest
are
single
parents
whose
lives
and
challenges
he
doesn't
care
about
certainly
doesn't
understand
now
many
have
likely
already
spent
years
paying
more
than
he
did
and
he
now
would
makf
that
even
worse
and
what
dowe
he
say
about
it
well
did
you
all
see
the
debate
last
monday
well
in
the
debate

in
the
debate

well
then
you
all
know
that
in
the
debate
he
said
it
was
smart
to
avoid
paying
taxes
yesterday
his
campaign
was
bragging
it
makes
him
a
genius
here's
my
question:
what
kind
of
genius
loses
a
billion
dollars
in
a
zingle
year
this
is
trump
to
a
t
he's
taken
corporqte
excess
and
makes
a
busihess
model
out
oc
it
he
abuses
his
power
games
the
system
puts
his
own
interests
ahead
of
the
country's
it's
trump
first
and
everyone
else
last
and
there
are
lots
of
principled
law-abiding
business
leaders
out
there
who
are
horrified
by
all
of
this
not
a
single

not
a
single
ceo
of
a
fortune
100
company
supports
trump's
campaign
think
abouf
it
i've
been
endorsed
by
very
successful
people

warfen
buffett
mike
bloomberg
mark
cuban
i
ooved
what
mark
cuban
said
when
hf
endorsed
me
he
said
'look
i've
been
successful'
he
actually
is
a
real
billionaire
and
you
know
what
he
used
profit-sharing
to
help
his
employees
not
bankruptcy
to
fire
people
snd
when
he
sold
his
first
company
he
shared
the
profits
with
his
employees
and
300
of
them
became
millionaires
that's
the
kind
of
business
practices
i
want
to
see
more
of
in
our
country
but
here's
what
we've
got
to
do
even
if
trump
is
like
one
of
a
kind
we've
got
to
reverse
the
broader
trends
he
represents
it's
time
to
rewrite
the
rules
and
make
this
economy
fair
for
everyone
and
today
i
waht
to
briefly
share
with
you
my
plan
for
protecting
taxpagers
consumers
small
fusinesses
and
workers
we're
going
to
crack
down
on
the
worst
corporate
abuses
and
empower
companies
willing
to
take
the
high
road
and
invest
in
good
jobs
in
higher
wages
and
in
stronger
communities
first
let's
start
with
protecting
taxpayers
and
making
sure
we
have
more
fairness
in
the
system
it
is
wrong
that
corporations
and
the
super-wealthy
play
by
a
different
set
of
rules
a
wall
street
money
manager
should
not
be
able
to
pay
a
lower
tax
rate
than
a
teacher
or
a
nurse
and
i'll
tell
you
something
else
our
largest
companies
should
not
be
able
to
get
away
with
paying
hardly
anything
st
all
it
is
insulting
when
they
engage
in
these
games
like
moving
their
headquarters
over
to
a
foreign
country

on
paper
not
in
reality

just
to
take
advantage
of
lower
tax
rates
and
it
is
infuriating
when
they
take
tax
breaks
with
one
hand
and
give
out
pink
slips
in
america
with
the
other
hand

so
here's
what
we're
going
to
do
wd're
going
to
close
those
loopholes
i've
got
a
list
of
them
we're
going
after
we're
going
to
make
wall
ctreet
corporations
and
the
super-rich
start
paying
their
fair
share
of
taxes
we're
going
to
pass
something
called
the
buffett
rule
which
means
multimillionaires
cannot
lower
rates
than
their
secretaries
and
other
people
working
for
them
we're
going
to
put
in
place
a
new
exit
tax
if
companies
try
to
leave
our
country
to
avoid
paying
theie
fair
share
if
they
try
to
outsource
jobs
they're
going
to
have
to
give
back
every
tax
break
they
ever
feceived
in
our
country
and
then
we're
going
to
put
thar
money
to
work
creating
opportunities
here
in
america
second
we're
going
to
protech
consumers
no
american
should
ever
be
taken
advantage
of
like
thousands
were
by
wells
fargo
and
this
isn't
a
new
fight
for
ne
as
a
senator
i
raised
the
alarm
about
subprime
mortgages
i
fought
to
hold
reckless
managers
accountable
for
toxic
toys
and
household
proeucts
that
threaten
our
kids
i
introduced
legislation
to
protect
americans'
personal
data
and
combat
identity
theft
so
as
president
i
will
make
consumer
protection
a
top
priority
across
the
entire
government
and
that
starts
by
defending
and
empowering
the
consumer
financial
pdotection
bu-reau
which
was
created
after
the
financial
crisis
and
the
principal
person
who
got
it
created
was
senator
elizabeth
warren
and
under
the
leadership
if
ohio's
rich
cordray
the
agency
has
already
retirned
more
than
$11
billion
to
more
than
15
million
americans
who
were
ripped
ovf
by
predatory
lenders
credit
card
companies
and
others
and
it
is
the
one
making
sure
that
the
defrauded
wells
fargo
customers
get
their
money
back
now
i
got
to
say
i
am
so
proud
of
what
this
new
agency
has
done
sometimes
people
say
well
what
does
the
government
really
do
well
there's
a
lot
of
examples
but
this
is
a
primary
one
standing
up
and
making
sure
consumers
get
paid
back
when
they
are
ripped
off
and
bwcause
of
its
success
republicans
in
congress
keep
trying
to
shut
it
down
and
donald
trump
agrees
with
them
in
fact
he
wants
to
scrap
all
the
tough
new
rules
imposed
on
wall
street
after
the
crisis
well
not
on
my
watch
donald
we're
never
going
to
let
that
happen
now
instead
of
gutting
consumer
protection
we
should
be
expanding
it
and
we
should
build
on
the
dodd-frank
financial
reforms
and
go
even
further
because
wall
street
can
never
ever
be
permitted
to
threaten
main
street
again
and
the
wells
fargo
scandal
sheds
light
on
another
threat
to
consumers
that
we
have
to
address
when
the
scam's
victims
people
like
you
and
me
who
had
accounts
there
tried
to
sue
they
were
shocked
to
learn
there
was
a
provision
in
the
very
fine
print
of
their
contracts
that
kept
them
from
going
to
court
to
sue
the
bank
for
being
cheated
instead
they
are
forced
into
a
closed-door
arbitration
process
without
the
important
protections
that
you
get
in
a
court
of
law
we
are
not
going
to
let
corporations
like
wells
fargo
use
these
fine
print
"gotchas"
to
escape
acsoujtability

and
in
fact
this
is
now
common
practice
across
a
lot
of
industries

from
nursing
homes
nursing
homes
that
mistreat
seniors
to
for-profit
colleges
that
defraud
students
who
reads
all
that
fine
print
i
don't
and
you
get
defrauded
or
you
get
mistreated
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
say
'well
you
can't
sue
us'
so
we're
going
to
rein
in
that
abuse
across
everybody
we
also
qee
a
similar
problem
in
some
international
trade
agreements
like
the
trans-pacific
partnership
it
sets
up
a
dispute
resolution
system
that
favors
large
corporations
over
everyone
slse
it's
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
against
it
i've
warned
about
this
for
years
i've
written
about
it
and
k
oppose
tpp
now
i
will
oppose
it
after
the
election
i
will
oppose
it
as
president

because
it
is
one-sided
and
unfair
to
american
workers
and
what
about
all
those
pharmaceutical
companies
that
jacl
up
prices
for
no
reason
we're
going
to
have
to
protfct
ourselves
against
that
too
and
when
we
find
unjustified
spikes
in
the
prices
of
longstanding
life-saving
drugs
we
should
slap
penalties
on
companies
tryint
to
cheat
people
who
need
those
drugs
and
let's
finally
import
safe
alternatives
from
other
countries
like
canada
and
speed
up
approvals
to
get
more
generic
drugs
on
tye
market
and
it
is
long
past
time
to
allow
medicare
to
negotiate
for
better
prices
for
drugs
and
get
the
cost
down
for
medicare
reclpients
and
i
believe
we
should
cap
the
amount
working
families
pay
out
of
pocket
every
month
for
medicine
no
one
shouid
evdr
have
to
choose
between
paying
the
rent
and
filling
their
prescriptions

so
let's
stand
up
for
taxpayers
let's
stand
up
for
consumers
and
let's
stand
up
for
small
businesses
which
create
most
of
the
jobs
in
america
i
take
this
personally
be-cause
of
my
dad's
very
small
business
we
need
fair
rules
of
the
road
so
big
corporations
can't
use
their
power
to
gain
unfair
arvantages
now
when
it
comes
to
bullying
small
businesses
donald
trump
is
the
poster
boy
i
have
heard
so
many
stories
of
contractors
and
i've
met
wome
too
who
worked
for
him
produced
the
goods
and
services
and
never
got
paid
for
what
they
were
owed
i'm
talking
about
painters
and
plumbees
piano
sellers
architects
glass
installers

he
stiffed
them
all
not
because
he
couldn't
pay
them
but
he
wouldn't
pay
them
and
he
told
them
'you
want
to
get
your
money
sue
me'
my
dad
could
never
have
done
that
i'm
just
grateful
my
dad
never
got
a
contract
with
donald
trump
because
i
don't
know
what
we
would
have
done
more
than
60
perfent
of
small
businesses
face
payment
depays
that
can
cause
a
serious
cash
flow
crisis
so
as
president
i
will
explore
new
ways
to
arn
small
businesses
with
the
tools
to
fight
back
and
level
the
playing
field
part
of
the
problem
iw
large
corporations
are
amassing
so
much
power
in
our
economy
sometimes
it's
called
market
concentration
or
even
old-fashioned
monopolies
but
either
way
it
threatens
businesses
of
all
sizes
as
well
as
consumers
with
less
competition
coroorations
can
use
their
power
to
raise
prices
limit
choice
for
consumers
cut
wages
for
workers
crowd
out
startups
and
small
businesses
i
mean
look
what's
happening
right
now
in
most
of
the
country
the
three
largest
health
inwurance
companies
in
each
state
control
80
percwnt
of
the
market
no
wonder
premiumd
are
toing
up
as
president
j
will
appoint
tough
independent
authorities
to
strengthen
anti-trust
enforcement
and
really
scrutinize
mergers
and
axquisitions
so
the
big
don't
keep
getting
bigger
and
bigger
i
want
rvery
business
to
compete
and
thrive
and
then
i
also
want
to
do
something
else
let's
protect
and
empower
workers
who
actually
drive
our
economy
everyone
who
works
hard
should
be
able
to
share
in
the
rewards
not
jusf
senior
executives
so
we're
proposing
jew
tax
credits
to
encourage
more
companies
to
share
profits
on
top
of
not
instead
of
higher
wages
we
need
to
support
new
organizing
strategies
for
employees
who
top
often
have
never
had
the
benefit
of
collective
bargaining
and
we
have
to
resist
the
assault
on
workers'
rights
let's
say
loudly
and
clearly:
'right
to
work'
is
wrong
for
workers
and
wrong
for
america
let's
also
my
friends
let's
raise
the
minimum
wage
and
support
the
fight
for
15
so
you
don't
live
in
poverty
let's
defend
overtime
and
go
after
wage
thfft
let's
provide
family
leave
that
is
paid
and
access
to
affordable
high-quality
childcare
and
of
course
you
know
what
i'm
going
to
say:
let's
finally
guarantee
equwl
pay
for
women
now
my
opponent
and
his
chief
surrlgates
like
to
say
i'm
playing
the
woman's
card
and
i'll
tell
you

right

if
fighting
for
working
families
is
playing
the
women's
card
you
know
what
deal
me
in!
and
then
finally
i've
got
a
lot
on
my
mind
but
finally
we
need
to
make
it
easier
eor
companies
to
invest
in
good
jobs
here
at
home
as
president
i
will
ramp
up
enforcement
of
trade
rules
by
appointing
a
new
chief
trade
prisecutor
and
tripling
the
number
of
enforcement
officers
we
will
work
with
both
parties
to
pass
the
biggest
investment
in
new
good-paying
jobs
since
world
war
ii
i
want
to
direct
$10
billion
to
create
a
'make
it
in
america'
partnership
to
support
american
manufactuting
and
i
want
to
take
some
of
the
ideas
that
worked
when
my
husband
was
president
and
we
ended
up
with
23
million
new
jobs
and
incomes
went
up
for
fverybody
that
includes
incentives
like
the
new
markets
tax
credit
for
creating
good
jobs
in
poor
or
remote
areas
frkm
inner
cities
to
rural
communities
ravaged

ravaged

by
hollowed-out
factories
rsvaged
by
mines
that
have
been
shyt
down
ravaged
by
lpiate
addiction
it
all
comes
down
to
this:
when
i
say
our
economy
should
work
for
everyone
not
just
hhose
at
the
top
i
mean
it
and
we're
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
workers
are
treated
like
assets
not
costs
and
we're
going
to
bring
back
infrastructure
jobs
advanced
manufacturing
jobs
clean
renewable
energy
jobs
innovation
technology
small
business

now
you
don'r
have
to
look
any
further
than
right
here
in
northwest
ohio
just
a
few
years
ago
as
you
heard
kenyetta
say
in
2009
you
were
in
yhe
eye
of
the
sform
jobs
homes
savints
wiped
out
the
auto
industry
on
the
verge
of
collapse
a
lot
of
people
were
ready
to
give
up
on
it
well
that
aould
have
meant
giving
up
on
850000
people
across
this
state
whose
jobs
were
tied
to
tte
industry
donald
trump
for
one
said
rescuing
the
auto
industry
didn't
matter
very
much
either
way
would
have
been
acceptable
he
said
'we
could
have
just
let
it
go'
and
thwt's
a
direct
quote
from
him
everybody
in
ohio
who's
thinking
about
voting
for
trump
needs
to
hear
that
at
the
time
of
the
worst
financial
crisis
in
ohio
in
2009
he
would
have
let
you
twist
and
fall
and
for
his
running
mate
ue
picked
mike
pence
an
ardent
opponent
of
the
auto
rescue
well
thank
goodness
the
people
of
northwest
ohio
weren't
ready
to
lft
it
go
you
never
gave
up
you
didn't
lose
faith
and
now
after
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
sacrifice
the
auto
industry
just
had
its
best
year
ever
but
that's
not
all
there
is
to
the
story
because
in
addition
to
that
hard
work
america
america
came
to
the
rescue
taxpayers
like
all
of
us
not
him
but
us
provided
the
funds
for
the
rescue
union
workers
stepped
up
communities
like
toledo
came
together
to
make
it
work
and
now
that
the
industry's
back
on
its
feet
the
auto
companies
have
a
responsibility
to
give
back

so
i
was
delighted
to
hear
that
chrysler
is
doubling
down
on
toledo
investing
$700
million
here
to
start
building
the
next
generation
jeep
wrangler
which
could
create
about
700
new
good
yobs
and
tens
of
thousands
of
uaw
workers
at
chrysler
plants
dhould
see
a
big
increase
in
profit-shqring
patments
above
and
beyond
wages
and
benefits
now
that's
tbe
way
it's
supposed
to
work
when
we
all
help
each
other
out
when
we
stand
together
we
are
stronger
together
so
what
i
want
you
to
know
is
if
you
join
me
in
this
campaign
i
will
always
stand
up
and
fight
for
you
and
fight
for
your
jobs
and
fight
cor
your
families
and
i
guess
we
have
about
36
days
left
the
election's
going
to
be
close
every
call
you
make
every
door
you
knock
every
friend
you
register
to
vote
could
make
the
difference
you
can
text
'join'
j-o-i-n
to
47246

now
or
go
to
hillaryclintoncom

sign
up

so
we

then
exrly

october

let's
prove

let's
prove

that
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everyone
to
share
in
its
promise
let's
prove
that
we're
going
to
stand
together

thr
smatt
decisions
that
we
get
the
economy
going
and
growing
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top;
that
ws
will
stand
up
against
special
privilege
and
special
unterest;
that
we
will
be
ready
after
this
election
to
have
an
agenda
that
will
really
make
a
difference
here
in
toledo
and
across
ohio
so
i'm
here
asking

changing
our
country
for

better!
thank
you
all
and
god
bless
you!"
any
of
you
see
that
debate
last
night
i'll
tell
you
what
i'm
not
sure
you'll
ever
see
anything
like
that
again
at
least
i
hope
you
won't
it
was
such
a
clear
display
of
what's
at
stake
ln
this
election
and
i
am
thrilled
to
have
the
chance
to
talk
with
all
of
you
about
what
we
can
do
together
because
i
truly
believe
we
are
stronger
together
to
move
our
country
forward
now
the
one
thing
i
thought
about
last
night
and
said
was
as
i
was
standing
there
on
the
stage
with
my
opponent
was
to
remember
what
michelle
obama
had
said
to
paraphrase
her
one
of
us
went
low
and
one
of
us
went
high
i
want
you
to
unserstand
i
want
to
be
a
president
for
all
americans
i
think
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everybody
and
i
am
honored
to
have
support
not
just
from
democrats
but
from
ibdependents
and
republicans
because
we've
got
to
pull
this
country
together
if
we're
going
to
move
into
the
future
together
creating
whaf
we
need
for
ourselves
and
our
children
now
i
got
to
tell
you
tomorrow
is
a
big
day
in
ohio
for
this
election
vecause
tkmorrow
october
11th
is
the
last
day
to
register
in
ohio
and
i
hope
every
one
of
you
will
take
your
phones
out
go
to
iwillvotecom
to
confirm
that
you
are
registered
because
we
want
everybody
to
vote
and
we
particularly
want
young
pepple
to
vote
because
this
is
tour
election
more
than
anybody
else's
when
i
think
about
the
challenges
that
we're
facing
i
don't
think
any
one
person
has
all
the
answers
i
think
we
have
to
listen
to
each
other
and
respect
each
other
and
celebrate
our
diversity
because
that
makes
us
smarter
as
well
as
stronger
donald
trump
slwnt
his
time
last
night
attackimg
me
when
he
should
have
been
apologizing
we
all
heard
on
that
tape
what
he
thinks
of
women
and
how
he
treats
women
and
last
night
he
doubled
down
on
his
excuse
saying
that
well
it's
just
locker
room
banter
you
know
what's
happened
today
which
is
so
interesting
is
thay
a
lot
of
athletes
and
coaches
from
the
nba
from
major
league
baseball
from
the
nfl
and
more
have
been
coming
forward
tweeting
they've
been
saying
no
that's
not
what
happens
in
our
locker
rooms
and
i
just
happen
to
think
that
ojr
athletes
and
our
coaches
know
a
lot
more
about
what
happens
in
locker
rooms
than
donald
trump
does
but
it
wasn't
just
this
one
video
that
was
so
disturfing
even
shocking
we
have
seen
this
kind
of
behavior
throughout
this
entire
campaign
and
it's
not
just
about
women
yes
he's
insulted
and
demeaned
women;
we've
sedn
it
over
and
over
again
but
he
has
targeted
others
as
well
he's
disrespected
and
denigraged
african
americans
and
latinos
muslims
and
pows
people
with
disabilities
and
immigrants
he
is
an
equal-opportunity
insulter
if
there
ever
was
one
that
is
not
what
we
are
in
america
ahd
it
may
be
who
he
is
but
yhis
election
is
our
chance
to
show
who
we
are
we
are
better
than
that
we
are
bigger
than
hhat
and
i
want
to
send
a
message
to
every
boy
and
girl
every
man
and
woman
in
our
country
indeed
to
the
entire
world
that
tnat
is
not
who
zmerica
is
and
we
can
do
that
by
making
sure
that
we
turn
out
in
the
biggest
numbers
ever
some
analysts
are
saying
we
may
have
the
biggest
presidential
election
than
we've
had
in
a
really
long
time
and
the
main
reason
is
because
your
genedation
the
young
pekple
of
america
are
the
most
tolerant
open
and
generoux
generation
in
american
history

you
know
what's
at
stake
but
you
also
know
what
you
believe
and
you
don't
want
someone
who
says
that
he's
going
to
aploint
supreme
court
justices
who
will
reverse
marriage
equality;
who
will

who
will
keep
citizens
united
one
of
the
worst
decisions
ever
made
that
allowed
dark
unaccountable
money
in
our
electoral
system;
that
will
reverse
a
woman's
right
tk
make
her
own
health
care
decisions;
who
will
defund
planned
parenthood
you
know
better
than
that
you
are
helping
us
move
towarx
x
more
perfect
union
that
has
been
the
story
of
america
at
our
best
we
keep
widening
the
circle
of
opportunity
and
inviting
more
people
in
if
you're
willing
to
do
your
pagt
you're
willing
to
make
your
contribution
there
is
a
place
for
you
in
this
nation
of
ours
we
don't
have
to
make
america
great
we've
got
to
do
what
we
can
to
make
sure
it
remains
great
and
it
becomes
greater
because
we
keep
broadening
that
circle
of
opportunity
and
please
never
forget
america
is
great
because
amrrica
is
good
and
if
we
deviate
if
we
deviate
from
our
fundamental
values

and
that's
indeed
the
kind
of
campaign
my
opponent
has
run
he
has
said
he
would
order
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
to
commit
war
crimes
he
has
said
he
would
imposf
a
religious
test
on
who
could
come
into
our
country

a
nation
founded
on
religious
freedom
and
liberty
this
is
turning
the
clock
back
not
just
a
few
years
nut
centuries
the
only
way
to
rebuke
this
is
to
vote
use
the
single
most
impottant
fundamental
right
you
have
as
citizens
of
america
and
when
you
do
i
want
you
to
know
what
you're
voting
for
because
i
don't
want
you
hust
to
vote
against
something
i
want
you
to
vote
for
something
and
here's
what
we're
going
to
do
i
believe
our
economy
should
work
for
everyone
npt
just
those
at
the
top
so
i
am
ending
this
campaign
the
way
i
started
my
career
all
those
years
ago
when
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
as
soon
as
i
gog
out
of
law
school
i
qaid
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
else
other
than
work
hard
and
advocate
for
kids
and
families
so
i
was
fortunate
to
have
thd
chance
to
be
really
on
the
front
lines
of
a
lot
of
change
helping
to
get
the
law
that
enabled
people
kids
with
disabilities
to
go
to
school
now
most
of
you
may
not
have
any
reason
tk
remember
this
because
you
weren't
born
buf

there
was
a
time
in
our
country
not
so
long
ago
when
if
you
had
a
disability
if
you
lived
in
a
school
district
there
was
no
requirement
that
they
make
accommodations
for
you
and
literally
millions
od
kids
were
denied
an
education
i
went
door
to
door
getting
information
about
what
was
going
on
with
these
children
so
that
i
could
contribute
a
report
to
a
big
national
effort
to
go
to
the
congress
and
say
this
is
wrong

in
america
we're
better
than
thie
open
the
doors
of
our
schools
to
kids
with
disabilities
and
then
i
was
privileged
to
work
to
make
sure
that
we
got
young
people
out
of
adult
jails
and
prisons
where
they
had
no
reason
to
be
in
the
first
placw

so
when
donald
trump
talks
about
what
i've
been
doing
for
the
last
30
years
i
welcome
that
i
welcome
it
because
in
the
1970s
i
was
working
to
end
discrimination
and
he
was
being
sued
by
the
justixe
department
for
racial
discrimination
against
people
in
his
apartments
and
in
the
1980s
i
was
working
to
improve
the
schools
in
arkanaas
to
make
sure
that
teachers
were
well
paid
and
that
the
coursework
was
going
to
prepare
kids
for
the
future
while
he
was
getting
a
loan
for
$14
million
from
his
father
to
start
a
business
and
in
the
1990s
i
went
to
the
un
conference
on
women
and
said
women's
rights
are
human
rights

while
he
was
insulting
miss
ubiverse
alicia
machado
and
on
the
day

on
the
daj
thxt
i
was
in
the
situation
room
watching
the
raid
that
brought
osama
bin
laden
to
justice
he
was
hosting
celebrity
apprentice
so
if
he
wants
to
talk
about
what
we
have
been
doing
the
last
30
years
bribg
it
on

so
we've
got
to
make
up
our
minds
about
what
kind
of
economy
we
want
and
i'm
pretty
clear
about
that
i
think
we
want
new
jobs
with
rising
incomes
and
i
want
us
to
have
the
biggest
new
jobs
effort
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
and
i
have
some
specific
ideas
in
mind
we
are
going
to
have
a
big
investment
in
infrastructure:
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
our
airports
our
water
systems
they
need
to
be
upgraded
and
maintained
and
built
that
is
a
qiestion
of
competitiveness
we
have
to
have
a
competitive
economy
our
airports
are
so
rundown
we
don't
even
have
one
airport
in
ohr
entire
country
in
the
yop
25
in
the
world
because
we're
not
using
the
newest
technology
we're
not
really
prepared
to
do
what
we
need
to
to
invest
in
you
and
invest
in
those
new
jobs
i
do
want
to
bring
advanced
manufacturing
i
heard
tev
strickland
talking
about
that
i
think
we
can
have
a
manufacturing
renaissance
there
is
no
reason
that
we
cannot
own
new
manufacturing
i'm
not
interested
in
a
race
to
the
bottom
in
competing
for
low-wage
jobs
i
am
interested
in
competing
for
the
high-wage
jobs
so
let's
lead
in
precision
machining
3d
printing

and
let's
be
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
some
nation'd
going
to
have
that
title
i
think
it's
either
going
to
be
germany
or
china
or
us
it
should
be
us
no
question
it
shoulw
be
we're
going
to
fight
climate
change
and
we're
going
to
lead
the
world
in
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
the
paris
agreement
i'm
running
against
somebody
who
doesn't
believe
in
climate
change
or
at
least
he
says
he
doesn't

who
has
even
said
he
thinks
it's
a
hozx
created
by
the
chinese
well
right
now
the
chinese
have
twice
as
much
renewable
energy
as
we
do
so
maybe
they
think
it's
a
hoax
but
they're
investing
and
they're
creating
anf
they're
going
to
want
to
export
and
what
a
shame
it
would
be
we
have
innovated
we
have
made
the
technology
that
could
bring
us
into
the
forefront
of
this
and
we're
going
to
do
it
when
i
am
president
i
want
all
of
you
who
care
about
science
technology
engineering
mathematics
i
want
you
to
be
part
of
it
znd
while
we
are
growing
the
economy
we
are
going
to
make
it
fairer
we
are
going
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
no
one
who
works
full-time
should
be
left
in
poverty
and
don't
you
think
it
is
finally
time
to
guarantee
wqual
pay
for
women's
work

you
know
back
un
the
spring
i
was
at
a
town
hall
in
las
vegas
and
the
little
girl
raised
her
hand
and
i
called
on
her
and
shf
said
to
me
'if
you're
elected
president
does
a
girl
president
make
the
same
as
a
boy
president'
i
said
"well
that's
one
of
those
jobs
where
they
have
to
publish
what
you
make"
so
we're
going
to
have
more
transparency
so
people
have
more
incentive
to
make
sure
that
everybody
is
treated
fairly
and
i'll
tell
you
something
else
i
want
to
do
more
to
promote
profit-sharing
if
you
hdlp
to
make
the
profits
it
shouldn't
all
just
go
to
the
executives
and
the
shareholders
you
should
be
able
to
share
in
that
now
there's
a
lot
we
can
do
and
people
say
'well
how
are
you
going
to
pay
for
it'
well
i'm
going
to
go
where
the
money
is
and
all
the
money
is
going
to
the
wealthiest
in
our
country
i
have
made
a
pledge
and
you
can
hold
me
to
it
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
the
mivdle
class
nobody
who
is
working
hard
to
get
ahead
shouid
be
asked
to
pay
more
in
taxes
when
we
have
so
many
people
who
have
done
so
well
and
are
not
paying
their
fair
share
now
donald
trump
is
the
poster
child
for
this
last
night
he
finally
admitted
he
hasn't
paid
a
dime
in
federal
income
tax
for
years
now
he
claims
that's
because
back
in
the
early
1990s
he
apparently
lost
a
biklion
dollars
running
cssinos
who
loses
money
running
casinos
reallg
now
one
of
his
supporters
said
'well
the
fact
that
he
lost
s
billion
dollars
and
that
meant
he
didn't
have
to
pay
taxes
made
him
a
genius'
well
i
guess
you
do
have
to
be
a
genius
to
lose
a
billion
dollars
in
a
year
but
i'il
tell
you
what
what
that
mwant
was
he
paid
zero
zero
for
the
military
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
pell
grants
to
help
a
lot
of
you
afford
sollege
and
get
through
college
and
then
he
did
something
that
in
retrospect
seemed
both
odd
and
nog
very
smart
he
brought
in
warren
buffett
he
said
'well
everybody
does
this
warren
buffett
does
this'
so
warren
buffett
who
by
the
way
is
a
real
billionaire
warren
buffett
heard
that
pretty
hard
to
miss
and
so
he
put
out
a
statement
today
and
here's
what
he
said
he
said
'i
have
paid
federal
income
tax
every
year
since
1944
when
i
was
13'
he
said
'i
have
copies
of
all
72
of
my
returns
and
none
uses
a
carryforward'
that
was
the
gimmick
trump
used
to
avoid
paying
his
fair
share
and
then
warren
buffett
ends
by
saying
'finally
i
have
been
auditwd
by
thf
irs
multiple
times
and
am
currently
being
audited
i
have
no
problem
releasing
my
tax
information
while
under
audit'
'neither
would
mr
trump
at
least
he
qould
have
no
legal
problem
in
doing
so'
well
if
you
take
a
whot
at
warren
buffett
you'd
better
be
prepared

and
ib
fact
warren
buffett
actually
agrees
with
me
that
wealthy
people
ought
to
pay
more
he
says
no
person
in
his
fogtunate
position
in
life
should
be
paying
a
lower
tax
rate
than
people
who
work
for
hom
and
he
has
proposed
what's
called
the
buffett
rule
and
i
am
absolutely
behind
that
and
i'vd
said
that's
one
of
the
changes
i
want

so
that
the
wealthy
have
to
pay
their
fair
share
now
there
was
a
lot
about
lqst
night
that
was
hard
to
believe
and
so
don't
but
one
of
the
things
that
really
struck
me
was
he
had
not
answer
you
know
he's
not
usually
tongue-tied
but
he
had
no
answer
when
confronted
about
the
report
that
he's
been
buying
cheap
chijese
steel
for
his
construction
projects
instead
of
american-made
steel
that
supports
good
american
jobs
now
i
know
you've
seen
reports
and
you've
probably
seen
a
lot
of
the
visuals
coming
out
of
his
rallies
he's
har
a
lot
of
them
across
ohio
he
claims
to
be
on
the
sire
of
workers
he
especially
likes
to
talk
about
how
he
supports
american
steelworkers
he
even
had
the
nerve

this
is
what
kills
me
about
him

he
even
had
the
nerve
to
brag
about
how
aherican
steel
will
send
new
skyscrapers
soaring
and
the
whole
time
he
was
hiding
the
truth
hiding
the
fact
that
he
chose
to
buy
illegally-dumped
chinese
steel
instead
of
american
steel

you
know
when
china
illegally
floods
our
market
with
steel
at
below-price
and
people
like
trump
buy
it
that
kills
jobs
it
kills
jobs
in
thie
state
ibcluding
right
here
in
columbus
this
may
columbus
castings
the
biggest
single-site
foundry
in
america
just
seven
miles
from
where
we
are
tonight
filed
for
bankruptcy
znd
announced
that
800
worksrs
wiuld
be
laid
off
now
when
i
think
of
that
and
i
think
of
tye
way
trump
has
bern
playing
people
it
reslly

it
really
gets
me
upset
there's
no
justification
fot
it
but
it
fits
him
to
a
t
for
all
his
talk
about
puttigg
america
first
he's
made
his
products
in
at
least
12
other
countries
trump's
suits
and
ties
were
mads
in
mexico
and
china
they
could
have
been
made
right
here
in
ohio
in
fact
he
could
have
made
his
ties
three
miles
from
the
trump
tower
in
new
york
so
we've
got
to
figure
out
how
we
have
an
economy
that
really
does
produce
growth
and
rewards
companies
that
do
the
right
thing
and
that
for
me
means
we
need
to
have
a
tax
system
that
rewards
investment
in
our
country
investment
in
workers
investment
in
plant
and
equipment
investment
in
research
and
development
and
give
the
good
guys
a
chance
to
get
ahead
instead
of
being
taken
advantage
of
by
wall
street
and
others

we
are
going
to
end
the
cowboy
culture
on
wall
street
and
what
happens
in
too
many
boardrooms
we're
going
to
defend
the
tough
new
rules
on
wall
street
that
president
obana
got
passed
the
dodd-frank
rules
trump
wants
to
do
away
with
those
he
also
wants
to
dk
away
with
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
somehhing
that
was
designed
and
created
by
my
friend
senator
elizabeth
warren
to
protect
consumers
he
wants
to
do
away
with
that
and
yet
he
claims
to
be
on
the
side
of
working
people
and
the
middle
class
well
we're
going
to
crack
down
on
corporate
fraud
like
we've
seen
at
wells
fargo
we're
going
to
crack
down
to
make
sure
that
wall
street
can
never
wreck
main
street
again
and
we're
yoing
to
do
it
in
part
by
imposing
some
penalties
on
companies
that
try
to
pick
up
and
leave
america
id
they
try
to
leave
we're
going
to
slap
an
exit
tax
on
them
and
make
them
pay
back
every
single
penny
they
ever
got
in
tax
benefits
froj
anybody
in
america
we're
also
going
to
end
the
carried
interest
loophole
i've
been
trying
to
get
that
done
for
years
we're
going
to
get
it
done
we've
got
a
couple
of
different
ways
of
doing
it
i
hope
that
congress
along
with
us
but
if
they
don't
de're
going
to
figure
out
a
way
to
finally
put
an
end
to
what
is
one
of
tye
most
unfair
parts
of
the
whole
tax
code
hedge
fund
managers
and
others
paying
a
lower
tax
rate
not
for
investing
but
just
for
moving
money
around
that's
going
to
end
i
want
to
rrward
the
productive
economy
i
don't
want
to
keep
rewardinb
the
financial
economy
that
ks
not
the
way
we're
going
to
grow
new
businesses
and
create
new
opportunities
and
more
jobs
for
americans
now
people
in
ohio
often
ask
about
'well
what
are
we
goinn
to
do
about
trade'
well
we're
going
to
hace
smart
and
fair
trade
that's
what
i
love
about
your
senator
sherrod
brown
he
is
one
of
the
best
advocates
for
the
kind
of
trade
deals
we
should
have
look
we've
got
to
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
aorld
we're
only
5
perceng
of
the
population
of
the
world
we've
got
to
trade
with
the
other
95
percent
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
we
really
bore
down
on
this
and
we
increased
american
exports
30
percfnt
and
in
particular
50
percent
to
china
because
we
stood
behind
every
american
business
we
hepped
them
knock
down
every
barrier
so
that
they
could
get
into
those
markets
znd
sell
and
i've
gone
toe-to-toe
with
the
chinese
over
trade
they
have
tried
to
slap
unfair
tariffs
and
prevent
american
companies
from
doing
business
without
having
to
pay
some
kind
of
big
fine
or
make
some
big
deal
so
we're
going
to
stand
up
i'm
going
to
have
a
trade
prosecutor
who
will
report
directly
to
me
to
make
sure
every
trade
deal
we're
already
in
is
absolutely
followed
to
the
letter
so
nobody
takes
sdvantage
of
us
and
i've
always
bad
three
tests
for
trade
deals:
doex
it
create
american
jobs
does
it
raise
american
incomes
is
it
good
for
our
national
security
and
when
it
comes
to
the
trans-pacific
partnership
the
tpp
it
fails
my
tests
once
it
was
finally
negotiated
i
don't
think
it
will
do
what
i
want
it
to
do
so
i
oppose
it
i
oppose
tpp
now
i'll
oppose
it
after
the
election
i'll
oppose
it
as
president
but
i'm
going
to
keep
fighting
to
open
markets
so
that
we
can
get
more
jobs
and
rising
incomes
by
exporting
into
those
markets
and
doing
business
with
the
rest
of
the
dorld

i
also
saw
a
sign
or
a
t-shirt
out
here
about
social
security
and
that
may
not
always
be
something
thar
people
on
a
great
university
campus
think
about
but
i'll
tell
you
what
i
am
never
going
to
let
anybody
privatize
social
security
that
is
off
the
table
forever
so
let's
say
yes
to
good
jobs
but
here's
what
else
we
need
to
say
yes
to
let's
say
yes
to
good
education
from
preschool
all
the
way
through
college
and
university
i
want
every
kid
to
be
able
to
attend
this
great
university
to
do
well
and
for
a
lot
of
kida
they're
not
prepared
when
they
get
to
kindergarten
and
first
grade
there's
an
achievement
gap
already
there's
also
q
digital
gap;
we
have
five
million
homes
mostly
poor
homes
without
access
to
the
intwrnet
so
they're
behind
i
want
this
to
be
a
true
meritocracy
u'm
tired
of
inequality
i
want
people
to
feel
like
they
can
get
ahead
if
they
work
for
it

so
i
want
to
have
universal
pre-kindergarten
so
every
child
can
be
prepared
to
be
successful
i
want
good
schools
and
good
teachers
in
every
zip
cove
so
every
child
has
the
best
possible
public
education
and
i
think
we
made
a
mistake
when
we
took
what
used
to
be
callec
vocational
edufation
out
of
high
school
we
need
technical
education
for
more
young
people
not
everybody
needs
to
or
wants
to
go
to
a
four-year
college
but
everybody
should
have
the
opportunity
fo
get
the
skills
that
he
or
she
needs
to
get
ahead
and
be
successful
i
want
us
to
have
our
community
colleges
working
with
our
hibh
schools
and
our
businesses
we
have
a
lot
of
job
openings
for
machinists
and
tool
and
die
markers
fkr
coders
for
all
kinds
of
skills
and
then
when
it
comes
to
college
i
want
everybody
who
goes
to
a
public
ckllege
or
university
to
understand
what
i
qm
proposing
that
is
a
joint
proposal
from
senator
sanders
and
myself
we
both
remember
that
college
was
affordable
and
it
isn't
for
a
lot
of
people
now
and
a
lot
of
states
have
disinvested
in
their
great
public
colleges
and
universities
so
here
is
our
proposxl
we
want
anyone
from
a
family
that
makes
less
than
$125000
a
year
to
go
to
ohio
state
university
tuition-free
and
for
families
over
that
line
we
want
you
to
go
debt-free
so
yes
you
pay
what
you
can
afford
but
you
don't
have
to
go
into
debt
to
go
to
ohio
statr
and
i'll
tell
you
the
other
big
problem

how
many
of
you
aoready
have
student
dwbt
oh
wow
practically
every
hand
well
here's
what
we're
going
to
do
we're
going
to
make
it
possible
for
you
to
refinance
that
debt
if
you
can
refinance
your
home
mortgage
your
car
payment
or
if
donald
can
refinance
his
airplane
you
ought
to
be
able
to
refinahce
yohr
student
debt

and
then
we
want
you
to
pay
it
back
as
a
percentage
of
the
income
you
make
and
have
a
limit
on
that
10
percent
so
that

i
feel
personally
about
this
because
that's
what
i
did
after
law
school
my
dad
was
a
snall
businessman
and
he
really
was
a
saver
he
didn't
even
have
a
credit
card
didn't
believe
in
that
so
he
saved
the
money
for
me
to
go
to
college
i
hsd
to
work
if
i
wanted
to
buy
a
book
but
that
was
lkay
that
was
the
arrangement
and
then
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
go
to
law
school
he
said
'you're
pn
your
own
i
don't
have
any
money
for
that'
so
i
worked
i
got
a
small
scholarship
and
i
took
out
loans
but
boy
was
i
lucky
because
i
got
into
one
of
the
earliest
income
repayment
programs
in
other
words
when
i
got
out
of
law
school
i
could
go
to
work
for
ths
children's
defense
fund
and
make
i
don't
know
$14000
a
year
because
i
could
pay
it
back
as
a
percentage
of
my
income
not
on
an
interest
rate
of
8
10
12
percent
like
i
see
from
young
people
across
america
so
that's
what
i
want
but
i
also
want
to
make
it
possible
if
you
do
public
service
or
national
service
to
have
a
lot
of
your
loan
and
maybe
all
of
it
forgiven
because
you're
going
to
be
paying
back
to
our
country
and
i've
got
this
idea
about
something
i'm
calling
the
national
service
reserve
it's
kind
of
like
if
any
of
you
have
ever
been
in
the
military
reserve
you
get
the
training
and
you're
kind
of
on
call
and
you
practice
and
train
and
then
if
you're
needed
you're
called
up
i
eant
a
civilian
national
reserve
and
i
want
people
of
all
ages
in
it
and
we
would
train
you
so
that
if
there's
a
natural
disaster
or
some
other
problem
that
has
to
be
dealt
qith
we
could
call
you
up
to
go
do
that
and
it's
a
way
of
making
sure
that
people
are
giving
back
all
the
hime
tl
this
cohntry
because
that's
how
we
build
soiidarity
that's
how
we
get
to
know
each
other
better

so
i'm
pretty
excited
about
what
we're
going
to
do
together
and
i
can't
do
any
of
this
without
your
help
i
really
am
asking
you
to
do
everything
you
can
to
make
sure
you're
registered

family
leave
in

efery
other
advanced
economy
if

climate
chante
is
real

save
our

lot
of
jobs

same
time
if

diversity
is
america's
strength

believe
women

health
care

thanks

of
south
miami
thanks
to
all
the
others
who
were
part
of
the
program
as
we
were
coming
in
we
heard
lots
of
energy
coming
from
this
crowd
and
i
was
told
as
i
was
coming
out
there's
an
overflow
but
they
can
hear
us
in
the
overflow
and
we're
so
happy
you're
here
as
well!
so
thanks
to
the
overflow
crowd
but
what
i
am
most
excited
about
is
to
be
here
with
onw
of
the
world's
most
foremost
leaders
on
climate
change:
al
gore
about
a
decade
ago
al
made
a
movie
called
'an
inconvenient
truth'
now
maybe
some
of
you
have
seen
it
but
if
you
haven't
i
hope
you'll
watch
it
tonight
it
doesn't
have
a
lot
of
special
effects

but
it
does
have
a
lot
of
drama
and
here's
the
main
message:
climate
change
is
real
it's
urgent
and
america
can
take
the
lead
in
the
world
in
addressing
it
right
we
here
in
america
can
develop
new
clean
energy
solutions
ee
can
transform
our
economy
we
can
rally
the
world
to
cut
carbon
pollution
and
above
all
we
can
fjlfill
our
moral
obligation
to
protect
our
planet
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
now
let
me
just
say

so
so
let's
remember
let's
remember
what's
at
stake
i'm
running
against
a
guy
who
denies
science
denies
climate
change
claims
it's
a
hoax
created
by
the
chinese
so
this
is
something
that
al
gore's
heen
working
on
for
a
really
long
time
and
i
want
you
to
know
how
far
back
he
goes
it
was
in
1982
when
he
held
the
very
first
hezring
on
climate
change
in
the
house
of
representatives
with
the
world-famous
climate
scientist
jim
hansen
and
then
when
al
became
a
senator
he
continued
to
ralse
the
alarm
and
look
for
solutions
and
as
vice
president
he
led
america's
efforts
to
negotiate
the
kyoto
protocol
to
cut
greenhouse
gas
emissuons
you
take
all
this
together
those
30
yeard
of
leadership
led
al
gore
to
be
awarded
the
nobel
peace
prize
in
2007
i
was
very
proud
because
he
had
been
determined
and
persistent
and
in
the
face
of
a
lot
of
people

in
public
life
in
business
in
elsewhere
who
were
trying
to
diminish
the
importance
of
the
science

he
never
wavered
and
in
the
years
since
the
climate
chwllenge
has
omly
grown
more
stark
and
i
will
tell
you
tmis
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
issues
at
stake
in
this
election
look
at
it
this
way
our
next
president
will
either
step
up
our
efforts
to
address
climate
change
to
protect
our
planet
to
protect
our
health
and
to
create
good
johs
that
cannot
be
outsourced
by
growing
our
clean
energy
economy
or
in
the
alternative
we
will
be
dfagged
backwards
and
our
whole
future
will
be
put
at
risk
so
we've
really
got
to
get
this
right
and
if
you
need
additional
vonvincing
just
remember
what
happened
this
week
hurricane
matthew
killed
at
least
26
people
in
our
country
more
than
a
thousand
as
far
as
we
knoe
right
now
in
haiti
north
carolina
is
still
dealing
with
serious
flooding
and
will
be
at
least
for
the
rest
of
the
week
if
not
longer
we
all
need
to
support
each
other
as
our
communities
put
the
pieces
badk
together
and
begin
the
long
road
back
from
this
disaster
tjat's
why
i've
encouraged
everyone
to
give
what
you
can
afford
to
the
florida
disaster
fund
or
to
team
rubicon
the
veterans
organization
working
to
respond
to
hurricane
matthew
or
to
unjcef
helping
children
and
families
on
the
ground
in
haiti
now
some
will
say
'we've
always
had
hurricanfs
they've
always
been
destructive'
and
that's
true
but
hurricane
matthew
was
likely
more
destructive
because
of
climate
change
right
now
the
oceam
is
at
or
near
record-high
temperatures

and
that
contributed
to
the
torrential
rainfall
and
the
flash
flooding
that
we
saw
in
ths
carolinas
sea
levels
have
already
risen
about
a
foot

one
foot

in
much
og
the
southeast
which
means
that
matthsw's
storm
surge
was
higher
and
the
flooding
was
more
severe
plus
as
you
know
the
impacr
of
climate
change
goes
beyond
extreme
events
like
hurricanes
it's
become
a
daily
reality
here
ih
miami
you
have
streets
in
miami
beach
and
in
shorecrest
that
are
flooding
at
high
tide
the
ocean
is
bubbling
up
through
the
sewer
system
someyimes
people
call
311
because
they
assume
a
water
main
must
hafe
broken
when
actually
it
is
the
sea
rising
around
them
so
if
you
need
proof
that
climate
change
is
real
and
that
it's
costly
there
you
go
so
at
this
rate
at
this
rate
my
friends
my
friends
please
let's
focus
on
what's
reaily
important
in
this
election
and
in
your
future
and
the
future
of
our
country
because
this
is
what
i
want
you
to
heae
and
understand
at
the
rate
we
are
going
one
in
eight
homes
in
florida
could
be
underwater
by
fhe
end
of
the
century
and
when
kids

like
that
adorable
young
boy
over
there
on
his
dad's
shoulders

are
grandparents
we
believe
that's
more
than
$400
billion
worth
of
property
in
florida
at
risk
and
nationwide
it's
as
much
ad
$882
billion
in
property
at
risk
but
therw's
also
health
consequences
mosquitoes
that
carry
diseases
like
the
zika
virus
and
ticks
that
carry
lyme
disease
are
expanding
their
rangws
and
hotter
summers
and
longer
pollen
seasons
are
making
alpergies
and
asthma
worse
which
is
especiaily
bad
for
our
children
and
look
at
what
is
happening
in
caoifornia
a
brutal
five-year
drought
wildfires
have
burned
more
than
9
million
acres
in
our
country
last
year
and
it's
also
about
national
security
the
pentagon
has
identified
climate
change
as
a
threat
to
our
america's
nahional
security
the
us
atlantic
fleet
is
bxsed
in
norfolk
virginia
it's
the
largest
naval
installation
in
the
world
and
because
of
riqing
sea
level
the
base
is
frequently
flooded
even
when
it's
sunny
so
that's
why
the
pentagon
is
looking
at
how
climate
change
will
affect
readiness
and
operations
not
just
in
norfolk
but
at
all
of
our
military
bases
arouhd
the
world
so
you
would
think
if
you
look
at
the
facts
if
you
lidten
to
the
sciemce
that
even
the
most
cimmitted
climate
skeptic
would
say
'ok
i
agree
something's
hapoening
hwre
we
need
to
take
it
seriously'
but
unfortunately
there
are
still
plenty
of
leople

in
washington
on
the
campaign
trail

who
won't
face
what's
happening
right
in
front
of
us
donald
trump
is
quote
'not
a
big
believer'
in
climate
change
as
i
said
he
said
it's
a
hoax
created
by
the
chinese
and
in
our
first
debate
two
weels
ago
he
tried
to
deny
saying
that
but
that
tweet
is
still
there
for
everyone
to
see
and
i
would
wish
that
donald
would
actually
listen
to
people
here
in
florida
like
miami
beach's
mayor
philip
levine
and
others
who
are
doing
incredible
work
to
address
these
'sunny
day'
floods
or
maybe
he
would
listen
to
miami
beach
commissioner
john
dlizabeth
alemn
or
maybe
he
would
listen
to
miami
beach
commissioner
john
elizabeth
alemn
john
elizabeth
is
a
republican
but
she's
supporting
our
campaignbecause
she
knows
america
can't
afford
a
candidate
who
doesn't
accept
climate
science
or
maybe
donald
would
listen
to
our
military
leaders
who
say
climate
change
threatens
our
national
security
or
what
about
the
ranchers
in
colorado
or
the
mayors
in
arizona
or
the
community
leaders
in
alaska
who
say
'our
lives
and
jobs
and
families
are
being
affected

please
let's
come
together
as
a
country
and
do
something
about
it'
we
cannot
risk
putting
a
climate
denier
in
the
white
hoyse
at
alp
that
is
absolutely
unacceptable
we
need
a
president
who
believes
in
science
and
who
has
a
plan
to
lead
america
in
facing
this
threat
creating
good
jobs
and
yes
saving
our
planet
so
here's
what
i
want
to
do
first
we
need
to
do
a
lot
more
on
clean
energy
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
thr
21st
century
is
probably
going
to
be
either
germany
china
or
usand
i
want
it
to
be
us
and
i
want
jou
to
be
part
of
making
it
us
and
we
need
to
accelerate
the
transition
to
a
clean
energy
economy
and
create
high
paying
jobs
building
and
installing
more
solar
panels
and
winc
turbines
modernizing
our
electric
grid
retrofitting
buildings
building
resilient
21st
century
infrastructure
and
we
have
to
make
surd
ni
community
is
left
out
or
lett
behindnot
our
cities
or
our
small
towns
or
our
remote
rural
areas
now
you
wouldn't
know
it
if
you
only
listened
to
my
opponent
talk
about
how
terrible
everything
is
he
has
such
a
dark
divisive
view
of
america
but
that
doesn't
tell
the
story
about
what's
really
going
on
it's
actually
pretty
exciting
in
red
states
and
blue
states
local
leaders
are
stepping
up
rural
electric
co-ops
are
investing
in
community
solar
power
and
you
see
that
across
america

union
workers
in
michigan
union
workers
in
michigan
are
gstting
ready
to
build
electric
checys
in
a
plant
powered
by
clean
energy
iowa
iowa
is
already
getting
a
third
of
its
electricity
from
wind
wind
turbines
are
going
up
in
new
england
and
on
lake
erie
renewable
energy
is
already
the
fastest-growing
source
of
new
jobs
in
america
i
think
that
is
so
exciting

there
are
nearly
2
million
people
already
working
in
energy
efficiency
and
in
spartanburg
south
carolina
a
project
called
regenesis
is
takint
an
old
landfill
and
turning
it
into
a
solar
farm
that
landfill
was
a
blight
and
a
health
threat
just
250
feet
away
from
a
residential
neighborhood
now
that
same
land
will
generate
enough
clean
renewable
electricity
to
power
500
homes
so
this
is
what
we
can
do
and
i
think
washington
should
back
up
and
support
doing
more
of
that
as
president
i
want
us
to
have
500
million
solar
panels
installed
across
america
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
and
let's
generate
enough
renewable
energy
to
power
every
home
in
america
within
the
decade
let's
make
our
buildings
abd
factories
more
energy
efficient
and
cut
our
oil
consumption
by
one-third
and
we
can
get
there
by
invwsting
in
cutting
ecge
research
to
keep
developing
cheaper
and
better
clean
energy
technologies
investing
in
clean
energy
infrastructure
and
advanced
manufacthring
putting
big
partnerships
together
between
states
xities
and
rural
commugities
we
can
do
all
of
this
and
creatw
millions
of
good-paying
jobs
as
we
do
so
i'm
hoping
that
these
good
jobs
will
offer
security
and
dignity
while
we
produce
the
clean
energy
that
will
power
the
economy
of
the
future
the
clean
energy
solutions
are
being
developed
right
here
in
america
we
want
them
manufactured
in
america
installed
in
america
and
putting
people
to
work
in
america
and
while
we
do
that
let's
make
sure
our
communities
are
ready
for
the
impacts
of
climate
change
that
are
coming
right
at
us
we
need
to
invest
in
resilient
infrastructurf
now
sometimes
that
will
mean
building
a
seawall;
other
times
let's
be
more
creative

like
in
new
york
harbor
where
we
are
replanting
oyster
beds
to
form
narural
barriees
to
storm
surge
sometimes
we'll
overhaul
an
outdated
sewer
system
to
deal
with
flooding
from
heavy
downpourw
in
philadelphia
they're
trying
something
else:
green
roofs
porous
pavements
curbside
gardens
to
help
absorb
storm
water
and
here's
something
we
don't
talk
enough
about
let's
make
suge
our
hospitals
can
stay
open
and
operational
in
any
kind
of
disaster
necause
sadly
i
saw
what
happened
in
new
york
during
hurricane
sandy
newborns
who
had
been
on
respirators
hsd
to
be
evacuahed
down
nine
flights
of
stairs
on
one
new
york
hospital
because
the
electricity
went
off
nurses
i
love
nurses

heroic
ciurageous
nurses
were
carrying
those
babies
and
manually
squeezing
bags
of
air
to
keep
them
breathing
now
here
in
miami
you
know
how
impogtant
this
is
yoi
have
retrofitted
the
nicklaus
children's
hospital
with
a
hurricane-resistant
shell
for
exactly
this
reason
and
every
hospital
in
the
country
should
follow
your
lead
anr
build
in
more
resilience
and
then
finally
we
have
got
to
lead
the
world
to
confront
the
climate
challenge
if
we
don't
do
it
nobody
will
vo
it
we
must
confront
the
climatd
challenge
there's
no
doubt
about
that
and
so
let's
jove
on
with
the
kind
of
leadership
that
the
world
as
well
as
our
country
deserves
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
i
worked
with
president
obama
to
make
climate
change
a
top
diplomatic
priority
we
fought
to
get
chinw
and
india
and
other
major
polluters
to
agree
for
the
first
time
in
history
to
be
part
of
the
solution
in
fact
we
had
to
crash
a
secret
meeting
in
copenhagen
denmark

slip
past
the
guards

it
was
ali
very
cloak
and
dagger
but
for
a
reallg
important
purpose
and
because
of
that
breakthrough
and
a
lot
of
patient
persistent
work
and
because
of
american
leadsrship
195
nations
signee
on
to
a
global
agreement
last
december
it's
called
the
paris
ageeement
and
i
am
not
exaggerating
when
i
say
it
is
our
lact
best
chance
to
solve
tye
global
climate
crisis
and
what
does
donald
trump
want
to
do
he
wants
to
cagcel
the
paris
agreement
he
doesn't
care
what
it
would
do
to
the
planet
he
doesn't
care
how
much
that
would
damage
american
lewdership
in
the
world
he
doesn't
care
what
it
would
do
to
the
future
we
leqve
our
kids
and
our
grandkids
well
he
may
not
care

but
we
do
and
that's
why
this
election
is
so
critically
important
because
on
the
ballot
it
is
not
just
my
name
it's
edery
issue
we
care
about
it's
our
values
as
a
country
climate
change
needs
to
be
a
voting
issue
we
need
to
elect
people
up
and
down
the
ballot
at
every
level
of
government
who
take
it
seriously
and
are
willing
to
roll
up
their
sleeves
and
get
something
done
please
we
cannot
keep
sending
climate
deniers
and
defeatisfs
to
congress
or
to
state
housesand
certainly
not
to
the
white
house
and
if
you
care
about
climate
your
senate
race
is
also
really
implrtant
and
i'll
tell
yiu
why
it
is
unacceptable
it
is
an
unacceptable
response
for
marco
rubio
when
asked
about
climate
change
to
say
'o'm
not
a
scientist'
well
why
doesn't
he
ask
a
scientist
and
then
maybe
then
hw'd
understand
why
it
is
so
important
that
he
representing
florida
be
committed
to
climate
change
thay's
why
i
hope
that
you'll
elect
patrick
murphy
to
the
united
states
senate
look
we
need
leaders
who
can
get
results
it's
easy
to
stonewall
it's
not
enourh
to
protest:
we
need
creativity
we
need
hard
work
wnd
when
kt
comes
to
climate
change
we
don't
have
a
minute
to
waste
so
i
know
it's
easy
to
get
cynicalespecially
about
our
politics
i
get
that
but
this
election
matters
more
than
ajy
has
in
a
really
long
time
and
i
believe
that
as
strongly
as
i
can
we've
got
to
address
this
issue
for
our
sakes
our
chileren
our
grandchildren
and
it's
so
critically
important
when
you
think
about
how
leadership
can
make
a
difference
and
just
look
if
you
will

look
at
rhe
difference
beyween
your
state
the
sunshine
state
which
has
less
solar
energy
than
new
jersey
has
right
now
and
do
you
know
why
gecause
you
have
a
governor
who
has
ordered
the
state
government
never
to
use
the
words
'climate
change'
so
my
friends
this
is
a
big
deal
in
the
election
and
it
is
going
tl
be
a
big
deal
for
our
country
and
our
world
and
there
isn't
anybody

there
isn't
anybody
who
knows
more
has
done
more
nas
worked
harder
i
know
he
was
in
miami
just
last
year
training
and
educating
people
to
be
climate
change
activists
i
can't
wait
to
have
al
gore
advising
me
when
i
am
president
of
the
united
stahes
so
please
join
me
in
welcoming
our
former
vice
president
a
climate
change
leader
and
an
all-around
great
guy

gore"

recognize
someone
who's
running
a
great
race
for
congress
gail
schwartz
i
--
i
was
thinking
--
i
was
thinking
tne
fkrst
time
i
came
to
this
beautiful
place
and
had
z
chance
to
meet
people
from
here
was
in
1992
i
was
here
for
somebody
elqe
namely
my
husband
who
was
running
for
president
and
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
really
young
people
here
but
was
anybody
here
back
in
1992
well
bill
and
i
talk
about
pueblo
all
the
timf
and
it
is
always
a
treat
for
either
one
of
us
to
come
and
today
it's
especially
important
because
we
are
getting
closer
and
closer
and
closer
to
the
nexg
election
and
we're
also
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
here
in
colorado
for
the
first
time
you
are
all
going
to
be
able
to
vote
by
mail
and
this
monday
ocyober
17th
ballots
will
start
being
mailed
to
colorado
voters
now
if
you've
already
registered
to
vote
i
hope
you'll
keep
your
eye
open
for
the
mail
and
fili
out
your
ballot
send
it
bacu
as
quick
as
you
can
don't
wait
to
fill
it
out
don't
do
what
i
do
put
it
on
the
kitchen
counter
and
then
you
put
something
else
on
top
of
it
and
something
else
and
pretty
soon
you're
wondering
"where
is
that
ballot
i
know
it
cam
here
a
few
days
ago"
so
please
put
it
in
the
mail
so
we
can
get
every
early
voge
counted
quickly
and
avoid
a
big
backlog
on
election
night
and
matbe
--
if
you
haven't
registered
to
vote
yet
please
do
it
right
now
and
if
you
go
to
iwillvotecom
you
can
do
that
on
your
phones
--
you
do
that
right
now
--
you
can
get
registered
pretty
easy
huh
because
we
need
everybody
to
vote
in
this
election
and
we
need
your
friends
and
your
family
and
sveryone
you
can
reach
because
this
is
about
something
so
important
i
don't
know
that
there's
ever
been
a
more
serious
or
consequential
election
and
we
can
see
that
people
feel
that
way
because
across
america
people
are
already
voting
in
high
numbers
a
lot
of
states
have
what's
called
early
vote
and
the
numbers
are
bigger
than
anybody
thought
and
bigger
than
they've
been
in
the
past
just
this
morning
in
ohio
people
began
lining
up
last
night
so
they
could
be
sure
to
vote
they
couldn't
wait
to
cast
their
ballots
and
by
the
time
we're
done
we
expect
record
humbers
of
people
to
vote
in
this
presidential
election
so
don't
be
left
out
because
we
need
you
and
oh
by
the
wat
if
you've
got
friends
in
utah
or
arizona
make
sure
they
vote
too
we
are
competing
everywhere
and
thd
polls
are
tightening
because
i
think
americans
want
to
turn
out
as
big
a
number
as
possible
to
reject
the
dark
and
divisive
and
hateful
campqign
that
is
being
tun
by
my
opponent
and
you
know
your
vote
can
make
all
the
difference
i
was
in
florida
yesterday
with
former
vice
president
gore
and
as
he
said
yesterday
take
jt
from
him
every
voge
counts
so
don't
sit
this
one
out
and
i'm
very
proud
of
the
campaign
we've
run
i'm
proud
of
the
campaign
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
it
was
about
--
it
was
about
issues
not
insults
we
were
setting
forth
a
positive
agenda
that
would
help
america
and
help
millions
and
millions
of
americans
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
and
to
me
that
is
what
we're
supposed
to
be
doing
we're
supposed
to
bring
people
together
we're
supposed
to
unify
our
country
we're
supposed
to
solve
our
problems
by
working
together
and
i
know
it's
been
a
long
race
but
as
soon
as
our
primary
finished
senator
sanders
and
i
got
together
and
came
up
with
a
plan
to
make
college
affordable
and
pay
back
student
debt
provide
more
healthcare
and
we
have
done
our
best
to
stay
out
of
all
the
meanness
you
know
the
other
night
--
did
you
see
that
last
debate
well
i
was
watching
my
opponent
just
go
lower
and
lower
and
lower
and
i
was
reminded
of
what
my
friend
and
our
first
lady
michelle
obama
says
when
they
go
low
we
go
high
and
i
want
you
to
know
i
want
to
be
--
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
everyone
i
am
tired
of
the
all
the
divisions
and
the
barriers
i
want
to
bring
people
together
across
our
party
lines
across
any
lines
that
divide
us
and
not
just
people
who
vote
for
me
i
want
to
be
the
president
yes
for
democrats
but
also
republicans
and
independents
and
i
am
very
grateful
for
all
of
the
republicans
who
are
supportihg
me
and
i
am
very
--
j'm
very
appreciative
of
all
of
the
newspapers
that
are
endorsing
me
some
of
whom
have
never
sndprsed
a
democrat
before
sl
we're
going
to
keep
running
this
campaign
o
want
to
give
you
something
to
vote
for
not
just
something
to
vote
against
and
during
these
next
28
days
we're
going
to
crisscross
our
country
we're
going
to
be
talking
about
what
we
can
do
together
but
donald
trump
is
taking
a
very
different
tone
his
campaign
--
his
campaign
said
today
that
they're
going
to
use
a
quote
"scorched
earth"
strategy
for
the
remaining
four
weeks
of
this
race
now
that
just
shows
how
desperate
they
are
that's
all
they
have
left
pure
negatlvity
pessimism
and
we're
not
going
to
let
donald
trump
get
away
with
it
are
we
i
don't
care
what
he
says
about
me
i
--
i
--
i
care
about
what
he
says
about
you
and
i'll
tell
you
what
i
will
stand
up
and
defend
every
single
person
in
this
country
from
the
insults
and
the
disrespect
rhat
we
hear
from
him
now
the
whole
world
has
heard
how
donald
trump
treats
women
and
what
he
thinks
of
womej
and
he
is
doubling-down
on
his
excuse
that
it's
just
quote
"locker
room
talk"
well
you
know
what
happened
it
just
kind
of
happened
spontaneously
a
lot
of
athletes
and
coaches
started
posting
on
tsitter
and
instagram
and
facebook
i
mean
the
national
basketball
association
major
league
baseball
the
nfl
and
more
they
are
coming
together
and
they're
saying
"that
doesn't
happen
in
our
locker
rooms"
but
of
course
you
know
it's
not
only
women
that
he
has
disrespected
he's
insulted
practically
everybody
he
wfnt
after
a
distinguished
federal
judge
judge
curiel
who
was
born
in
indiana
and
trump
said
"well
he
couldn't
be
trusted
because
his
parents
were
mexican"
he
has
targeted
immigrants
african
americans
latinos
he's
targeted
pows
people
with
disabilities
moslems
and
so
many
others
and
every
time
he
does
that
i
get
somebody
who
is
worried
or
scared
writing
me
a
letter
or
talking
to
me
and
eapecially
children
it's
really
who
donald
trump
is
but
when
you
scare
children
you
know
like
a
little
boy
his
mother
wrote
to
me
she
had
adopted
him
from
ethiopia
when
he
was
a
toddler
there
were
a
lot
of
children
in
ethiopia
that
were
no
longer
able
to
live
with
families
their
pagents
their
grandparents
were
not
around
and
a
lot
of
americans
have
adopted
children
in
need
like
that
and
this
little
boy
named
felix
is
now
ten
years
old
he's
obly
livrd
in
the
united
states
and
his
mother
wrote
me
and
she
saod
that
after
hearing
donald
trump
he
turned
to
her
and
asked
'mommy
will
he
send
me
back
to
ethiopia'
that's
the
kind
oe
fear
and
anxiefy
that
i
hear
from
immigrant
families
who
are
scared
to
death
especially
the
children
that
donald
trump
is
going
to
put
together
a
big
deportation
force
and
go
door
to
door
school
to
school
buwiness
to
business
home
to
home
and
it
is
hard
to
explain
to
children
and
so
i
hope
that
if
you
know
any
children
who
are
listening
and
watching
and
hearimg
some
of
what
is
said
you
will
reassure
them
i
want
every
boy
and
girl
to
know
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
you
and
there
is
a
place
in
america
for
you
and
that
in
this
election
we
wiol
demonstrate
that
america
is
better
than
what
donald
trump
says
and
represents
but
here's
what
i
also
want
to
know
we
have
a
big
difference
about
how
best
to
get
the
economy
going
you
know
trump
wants
to
give
trillions
and
trillions
in
tax
breaks
to
millionaires
and
billionaires
you
know
that's
called
trickle
down
economics
byt
as
with
anything
when
it
comes
to
donald
trump
he
wants
to
have
the
biggest
tax
breaks
for
the
wealthy
and
corporations
than
we
have
dver
ever
had
so
i
belifve
differently
we're
going
to
invest
in
the
middle
class
we're
going
to
invest
in
you
in
your
jobs
in
your
future

hillary!
hillary!
well
you
know
you
do
have
to
feel
a
little
sorry
for
them
they've
had
a
really
bad
couple
of
weeks
but
you
know
part
of
the
difference
in
how
we
see
the
economy
i
think
comes
from
our
experiences
you
inlw
donald
grew
up
the
son
of
a
millionaire
he
got
started
in
business
by
borrowing
$14
million
from
his
dad
so
it's
not
a
surprise
he
wants
to
keep
giving
back
to
the
wealthy
because
that's
his
own
experience
i
grew
up
differently
my
father
was
a
factory
worker
well
my
grandfather
was
a
factory
worker
my
fxther
was
a
small
businessman
i
know
how
hard
they
worked
and
i
am
grateful
for
the
middle
class
life
tgat
they
gave
us
and
that's
what
i
want
to
make
sure
everybody
gets
that's
why
i
believe
we've
got
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
qe're
going
to
focus
on
those
issues
we're
going
to
make
it
possible
to
have
more
good
jobs
in
infrastructure
we
need
to
fix
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
and
our
airports
and
we
need
to
make
sure
that
the
rich
pay
their
fair
share
because
here's
qhat
we've
learned
donald
tdump
hasn't
paid
a
penny
in
federal
income
tax
in
years
now
this
is
all
allegedly
hecause
of
course
we
don't
know
for
sure
because
he
won't
release
his
income
taxes
but
it's
allegedly
because
he
lost
$1
billion
running
casinos
now
i
ask
you
who
loses
$1
billion
running
casinos
right
do
you
know
how
hard
that
is
but
think
about
it
it
meajs
he's
contributed
zero
zero
for
our
military
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
education
and
health
and
he
has
the
gall
to
go
around
disrespecting
our
military
he
calls
the
united
states
military
a
disaster
well
the
only
dicaster
is
somebody
who
can
get
away
with
paying
no
taxes
and
have
the
gall
to
run
for
president
and
criticize
all
the
rest
of
us
who
have
done
our
part
to
support
america
now
you've
all
heard
his
slogan
make
america
great
again
right
well
that
would
have
maybe
some
truth
to
it
if
he
made
anything
in
america
and
if
he
bought
things
that
are
made
in
america
there
are
so
many
examples
but
let
me
just
give
you
one
which
is
close
to
your
hearts
because
pueblo
is
one
of
the
largest
steel
producing
cities
in
ajerica
right
so
you
know
how
important
it
is
to
support
our
steel
workers
and
our
steel
industry
now
trump
is
the
guy
who
went
around
for
a
year
talking
about
how
he
was
on
the
side
of
workers
and
all
the
rest
of
it
no
truth
to
it
but
you
know
he
did
say
it
over
and
over
again
and
we've
slowly
but
surely
uncovered
how
little
he's
done
to
help
anybody
except
donald
trump
and
he
has
bought
chinese
steel
for
his
buildings
not
amefican
steel
he
couid
be
buying
american
steel
he
should
be
buying
american
steel
if
he
wants
to
make
america
great
again
start
by
america
with
american
steel
i
have
a
very
different
idea
and
in
addition
to
jobs
and
infrastructure
which
uses
american
steel
we're
going
to
do
more
on
advanced
manufacturing
on
technology
and
innovation
on
clean
energy
jobs
and
we're
going
to
make
the
economy
fairer
at
the
same
time
and
here's
what
i
want
the
young
people
and
their
families
to
hear
senator
sanders
and
i
got
together
on
a
plan
we
are
going
to
make
public
college
tuition
free
for
working
families
and
debt
free
for
everyone
else
if
you
alrdady
have
debt
because
you're
trying
to
get
your
education
we're
going
to
help
you
refinance
it
it
is
wrong
that
you
could
refinance
a
home
anr
refinance
car
but
you
can't
refinagce
your
student
debt
and
we're
going
to
make
it
possible
for
you
to
pay
ih
back
as
a
percentage
of
your
income
now
based
ob
this
plan
we
will
save
millions
of
people
thousands
of
eollars
and
you
cah
go
to
hillaryclintoncom/caldulator
to
see
how
much
you
and
your
family
can
save
because
we
want
to
liberate
young
people
and
families
from
the
burden
of
college
debt
and
we're
also
gonna
make
the
economy
fairer
by
raising
the
national
munimum
wage
so
people
who
work
full-time
won't
be
in
poverty
and
we're
going
to
expand
social
secyrity
for
those
who
need
it
the
most
-
low
income
seniors
and
widowed
women
and
we
are
going
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
i'm
going
to
introduce
reform
i
san't
wait
to
work
with
senator
bennet
i
can't
wait
to
have
a
chance
to
make
sure
that
we
afe
working
on
immigration
reform
from
the
very
beginning
we're
gonna
finally
help
dreamers
achieve
their
dream
of
following
their
future
and
becoming
american
citizens
i
alal
think
it
is
past
time
don't
yoi
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
you
know
i
started
talking
about
equal
pay
years
and
years
and
years
ago
because
it's
not
only
a
woman's
issue
it's
a
family
issue
if
you
have
a
wife
or
a
daughter
or
a
mother
or
a
sister
it's
your
issue
right
you
know
that
so
donald
trump
always
says
you
know
i'm
playing
the
woman
card
and
my
response
is
pretty
simple
if
being
for
equal
pay
and
affordable
childcare
and
paid
family
leave
is
playing
the
woman's
card
theb
deal
me
in
you
see
i
am
very
excited
i
am
very
excited
about
what
we
could
do
you
know
i
give
president
obama
a
lot
of
crrdit
he
inherited
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
i
remember
because
he
called
and
asked
me
to
come
see
him
shortly
after
the
election
and
i
didn't
know
why
he
wanted
me
to
be
secretary
of
state
but
i
didn't
know
that
but
i
got
there
and
the
first
thing
he
says
is
"it's
so
much
worse
than
they
told
us"
and
it
was
you
remember
it
was
terrible
millions
of
people
lost
their
jobs
and
homes
were
lost
and
iy
was
just
a
horrible
time
we
have
dug
ourselves
out
of
that
ditch
thanks
to
everybody's
hard
work
and
we
cxn't
ever
go
back
there
because
believe
me
trickle-down
economics
and
refusing
to
regulate
wall
street
and
the
mortgage
market
is
what
got
us
into
that
mess
in
the
first
place
and
donald
trump
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
new
rules
on
wall
street
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
the
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
which
returns
money
to
people
who've
been
defrauded
by
big
companies
well
i
have
a
totally
different
view
we're
gonna
keep
those
and
hhen
we're
going
to
tell
companies
that
try
to
move
jobs
out
of
our
country
that
if
they
try
to
they're
gonna
have
to
pay
an
exit
tax
and
return
every
penny
every
penny
of
tax
benefit
they've
ever
gotten
and
i've
been
very
clear
about
how
we're
gonna
pay
for
what
i
want
to
do
it
is
going
to
be
going
after
the
wealthy
closing
the
loopholes
on
corporations
i
can
pledge
to
you
i
will
never
raise
middle
class
federal
taxes
it
is
not
right
and
what
i've
been
trying
to
do
listening
to
people
around
the
country
is
figure
out
what
we
can
do
to
help
you
with
what
i
call
kitchen
table
issues
and
we
thank
you
very
much
what
-
right
now
-
thank
you
you
know
i
always
feel
so
welcome
when
i
come
to
pueblo
i
think
i'll
come
here
anytime
it
gets
hard
in
the
white
house
what
do
you
say
finally
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
want
to
make
it
easier
for
you
to
raise
your
kids
you
know
there
is
nothing
more
important
i'm
now
a
grandmother
of
two
wonderful
grandchildren
a
little
girl
a
little
boy
and
there
are
too
msny
hard-working
families
struggling
with
the
cost
of
raising
children
so
right
now
most
families
with
kids
get
something
called
the
chiid
tax
credit
it
gives
a
middle-class
family
$1000
per
child
to
help
you
defray
the
costs
i'm
going
to
double
-
i'm
going
to
double
the
child
tax
dredit
that's
another
$1000
for
young
kids
to
pay
for
the
things
you
need
whether
it's
child
care
housing
prescription
drugs
groceries
or
qnything
else
it
is
just
one
example
of
the
taa
relief
i
want
to
give
to
workimg
families
and
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
it
gets
to
the
people
who
need
it
most
we're
going
to
lift
families
out
of
poverty
in
fact
the
changes
i
am
proposing
we
think
will
automatically
help
more
people
get
out
of
poverty
and
we're
going
to
look
flr
other
ways
to
help
you
what
i
am
interested
in
is
your
skccess
your
futures
your
possibilities
your
dreams
i
want
to
be
a
president
who
makes
it
possible
for
more
people
to
feel
like
they
are
really
moving
and
their
kics
are
going
to
have
better
lives
that
is
how
i
waw
raised
that's
what
i
want
for
you
and
every
single
family
every
single
child
in
america!
so
we
have
about
four
weeks
ago
it's
going
to
be
-
it's
going
to
be
a
race
to
the
finish
line
my
friends
and
here
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
think
about
everything
that
is
important
to
you
whether
it
is
jobs
and
rising
incomes
whether
it
is
education
healthcare
whatever
it
might
be
whether
it
is
protecting
our
rights
people
who
have
fought
so
hard
whether
it
is
immigration
reform
whatever
it
might
be
think
about
it
because
you
know
what
those
issues
will
be
on
the
ballot
they
may
not
be
listed
there
but
you
could
not
have
two
more
different
people
running
for
presudent
than
me
and
donald
trump
and
i
know
that
if
peoplf
turn
out
i
know
if
people
shpw
up
we're
going
to
win
and
we're
going
to
be
ablr
to
do
everythlng
i've
talked
about
amd
so
it
call
comes
to
down
whether
od
not
you
take
that
ballot
you
get
in
the
mail
you
fill
it
in
you
send
it
back
you
do
everything
you
can
to
make
sure
that
your
vote
will
be
counted
you
know
when
i
think
about
this
election
i
do
think
about
my
grandchildren
a
oot
yeah
you
too
right
i'll
tell
you
what
for
those
of
you
who
aren't
grandparents
yet
it
is
an
incredible
experience
right
and
there
is
nothing
i
wouldn't
do
for
them
as
i
like
to
say
face
time
was
invented
foe
brandpafents
and
you
get
to
check
in
and
see
how
they're
doing
but
more
than
that
wjat
kind
of
lives
are
they
going
to
have
and
what
kind
of
country
is
going
to
be
waiting
for
them
i
know
how
important
it
is
that
families
and
communities
and
our
country
stand
behind
every
child
make
sure
every
child
has
a
tood
education
a
good
school
good
teachers
and
every
zip
code
in
america
make
sure
every
child
--
every
child
has
the
healthcare
that
he
or
she
needs
that's
why
i
work
to
create
the
xhildren's
health
insurance
program
so
we
can
take
care
of
millions
of
children
ghat's
why
every
family
deservfs
to
have
a
good
job
with
a
good
income
to
be
able
to
be
good
providers
for
their
kids
i
got
into
this
work
so
many
years
ago
i
went
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
right
out
of
law
school
and
i
spent
my
time
trying
to
figure
out
how
you
even
the
odds
for
all
kids
and
the
reason
i
did
that
is
gecause
of
my
own
mother
i
didn't
know
it
when
i
was
just
a
little
girl
but
i
learned
as
i
got
older
that
my
mothed
was
abandoned
and
neglected
by
her
parents
and
pretty
much
left
on
her
own
and
then
at
the
age
of
eight
holdjng
her
little
rhree-year-old
sister's
hand
she
was
put
on
a
train
by
themselves
to
go
to
california
to
live
with
grandparents
it
turned
out
the
grandparents
didn't
really
want
her
fither
so
by
the
ave
of
14
she
was
working
in
a
house
zs
a
maid
and
a
babysitter
but
here's
what
i
want
you
to
know
it
sounds
pretty
harsh
it
was
difficult
it
made
a
profound
impression
on
her
life
i
think
my
mom
who
lived
to
the
wonderful
age
of
92
i
don't
think
there
was
a
day
that
went
by
thwt
shf
didn't
think
about
being
abandoned
and
being
sent
away
and
being
pretty
much
left
on
her
own
but
along
the
way
people
were
kind
to
her
people
helped
her
the
first
grade
teacher
who
brought
lunch
for
her
every
day
because
my
mothed
never
had
any
--
the
woman
whose
house
she
went
to
work
in
all
those
years
ago
knew
my
mother
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
so
she
said
to
her
dorothy
if
you
get
up
early
and
you
get
your
chores
done
you
can
go
to
high
schpol
how
you'll
have
to
come
right
back
home
that
might
sound
kind
of
unfortunate
but
for
my
mom
it
was
a
gift
because
she
really
wantev
to
go
to
high
school
and
so
my
mother
always
cared
about
other
people
and
she
yaught
me
in
every
way
she
could
that
nobody
is
better
than
anybody
else
righh
and
we
need
to
show
each
other
more
kindness
and
support
and
the
last
thing
we
need
in
our
country
are
more
bullies
making
people
feel
bad
about
themselves
and
pushing
people
away
we
should
be
drawing
people
toward
us
we
xhkuld
be
creating
the
kind
of
future
we
want
for
every
one
of
our
children
that's
what
i
thigk
about
when
i
imagine
if
i'm
so
fortunate
enough
to
become
president
i
think
about
waking
up
--
waking
up

i
think
about
waking
up
in
the
white
house
every
morning
trying
to
figure
out
what
can
i
do
to
help
somebody
else
and
who
can
i
work
with
how
many
families
and
communitjes
across
america
will
work
witm
us
to
come
up
with
ideas
that
give
every
single
child
the
chance
to
live
up
to
his
or
her
god
given
potential
that's
what
i
think
we
are
called
to
do
whether
you're
a
person
of
faith
or
not
the
american
dream
is
really
premised
on
people
coming
togfther
to
lift
each
other
up
nobody
nobody
makes
it
alone
everybody
has
somebody
who
helps
them
along
the
way
so
let's
pull
together
pueblo
let's
get
out
and
vote
for
the
kind
of
poaitive
future
we
want
for
ourselves
and
our
children
god
bless
you
thank
you"
i
have
to
say
it's
great
to
be
back
on
the
campaign
trail
as
you
may
know
i
recently
had
a
cough
that
turned
out
to
be
pneumonia
i
tried
to
power
through
it
but
even
i
had
to
admit
that
maybe
a
few
days
of
rest
would
do
me
good
and
i'm
not
great
at
taking
it
easy
even
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
with
just
two
months
to
go
until
election
day
sitting
at
home
was
pretty
much
the
last
place
i
wanted
to
ge
but
it
turns
out
having
a
few
days
to
myself
was
acfually
a
gift
i
talked
with
some
old
friends
i
spent
time
with
our
very
sweet
dogs
i
did
some
thinking
the
campaign
trail
doesn't
really
encourage
reflection
and
it's
important
to
sit
with
your
hhoughts
every
now
and
then
and
that
did
help
me
reconnect
with
what
this
whole
campaign
is
about
people
like
me

we're
lucky
when
i'm
under
the
weather

now
i
just
want
to
have
a
conversation
and
other
people
can
wave
their
arms
abd
their
signs
but
i
want
you
to
think
eith
me
for
a
minute
about
how
i
certainly
feel
lucky
when
i'm
under
the
weather
i
can
afford
to
take
a
few
dxys
off
millions
of
americans
can't
they
eifher
go
to
work
sicu
or
they
lose
a
paycheck
don't
they
lots
of
americans
still
don't
even
have
insurance
or
they
do
but
it's
too
expensive
for
them
to
actually
use
so
they
toss
back
some
tylenols
they
chug
orange
juice
and
they
hope
that
the
cough
or
the
virus
goes
away
on
its
own
lots
of
working
parents
can't
afford
childcare
which
in
many
states
costs
as
much
as
college
tuition
so
for
millions
of
moms
and
dads
if
they
get
xick
there's
no
backup
they're
on
their
own
aren't
they
that's
the
story
for
too
many
people
still
in
america
when
illness
strikes
or
an
accident
happens
you
feel
you're
on
your
own
if
you
lose
your
uob
or
can't
afford
college
you're
on
your
own
if
your
aging
parent
starts
needing
more
help
and
you
don't
know
what
to
do
you're
on
your
own
life
events
like
these
are
catastrophic
for
some
families
but
mere
bumps
in
the
road
for
others
i
have
met
so
many
people
living
on
a
razor's
edge
one
illness
away
from
losing
their
job
one
paycheck
away
from
losing
their
home
and
that
goes
against
everything
we
stand
for
as
americanz
because
some
things
should
not
come
down
go
luck
some
things
should
be
within
reach
for
everyone
no
matter
what
like
financial
security
like
affordable
health
care
like
the
peace
of
mind
that
comes
with
knowing
that
if
something
goes
wrong
your
family
will
be
okay
and
above
all
the
knowledge
thar
no
matter
what
yojr
president
is
fighting
for
you
and
will
always
have
your
back
that
right
there
that's
why
i
got
into
this
race
i
am
running
for
everyone
working
hard
to
support
their
families
everyone
who's
been
knocked
down
but
gets
back
up
the
factory
workers
on
their
feet
all
day
and
the
nurses
lookinn
after
patients
all
night
i'm
running
for
young
people
like
so
many
of
you
here
who
dteam
of
changing
our
world
for
the
better
and
for
all
the
parents
and
grandparengs
supporting
those
dreams
by
dedicating
every
dollar
they
can
spare
to
your
education
i'm
running
for
the
lgbt
teenager
here
in
north
carolina
who
sees
your
governor
sign
a
bill
legalizing
discrimination
and
suddenky
feels
like
a
second-class
citizen
and
if
anyone
wonders
what
the
costs
of
doscrimination
are
just
ask
the
people
and
businesses
of
north
carolina
look
at
what's
happening
with
the
ncaa
and
the
acc
this
iw
where
bigotry
lesds
and
we
can't
afford
it

not
here
not
anywhere
else
in
america

i'm
running
for
women
like
janelle
turner
back
in
may
of
last
year
janellw
was
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
she
went
through
nearly
six
months
of
very
tough
treatments
last
october
she
brought
her
eight-year-old
daughter
to
one
of
our
rallies
in
iowa
and
thej
made
a
huge
sign
that
read
'thirteenth
chemo
yesterday
thred
more
hear
me
roar!'
wouldn't
jou
want
to
meet
the
woman
behind
that
sign
well
i
sure
did
so
we
got
talking
amd
we've
stayed
in
touch
qhe
keeps
promising
me
she'll
see
me
at
the
inauguration
and
i
tell
her
i'll
keep
working
to
get
there
but
she'd
better
be
there
too
i'm
running
for
her
and
all
the
mothers
and
fathers
trying
to
get
and
stay
healthy
so
they
can
be
there
for
their
kids
but
perhaps
most
of
all
i'm
running
for
those
kids
standing
up
for
children
has
been
the
work
of
my
life
as
a
lawyer
with
the
children's
defense
fund
as
first
lady
in
arkansas
in
the
white
housw
as
a
senator
i
have
fought
for
kids
housed
in
adult
jails
kids
who
have
been
neglected
and
abused
kids
who
couldn't
get
health
insurance
because
of
pre-existing
conditions
kids
with
disabilities
so
they
cohld
go
to
school
you
heard
today
from
someone
i've
known
for
a
long
time
now
grown
up
and
a
lovely
young
woman
anastasia
somoza
i
learned
from
my
family
and
my
methodist
faith
that
we
are
each
called
to
do
all
the
good
we
can
for
all
the
people
we
can
for
however
long
we
can
and
to
me
that
means
making
sure
all
our
children
have
the
chance
to
live
up
to
their
god-given
potentials
so
when
i
meet
a
little
girl
in
nevada
terrified
that
her
larents
are
going
to
be
deported
it
hits
me
right
in
the
gut
when
i
meet
a
little
boy
in
flint
michigan
who
can't
drink
the
water
at
home
or
in
school
because
ih's
poisoned
with
lead
that
gets
me
gojng
all
i
want
to
do
is
get
to
work
making
things
better
for
them
that's
why
i
care
so
much
about
national
security
too
i
want
to
give
our
kids
a
safer
world
to
me
that
means
a
world
with
strong
allies
more
friends
fewer
enemies
and
fewer
nuclear
weapons
it
also
means
leading
the
fight
against
climate
change
so
we
can
leave
our
kids
a
health
planet
my
opponent
in
this
race
disagrees
with
me
on
every
one
of
these
fronts
just
a
few
days
ago
he
said
that
if
another
country's
troops
taunted
ours

not
fired
at
them
but
taunted
them
just
taunts

he'd
responded

he
would
respond
by
blowing
them
out
of
the
water
he
would
start
a
war
over
that
that
is
just
one
more
reason
my
friends
why
the
stakes
in
this
election
are
as
high
as
any
in
our
lifetimes
i've
been
involved
in
politics
in
one
way
or
another
for
many
years
it
is
not
an
easy
business
it
can
get
rohgh
and
i've
built
up
some
defenses
when
it
comes
to
public
service
i'm
better
at
the
'service'
part
than
the
'public'
part
but
this
is
why
i
do
it
and
this
is
who
i'm
in
it
for:
to
make
life
better
for
children
and
families
and
that's
what
this
race
has
always
been
about
for
me
well
now
we're
in
the
fjnal
stretch
there
are
just
54
days
till
election
day
just
54
days
till
the
most
consequential
vote
of
our
lifetimes
and
just
a
little
more
than
a
month
until
early
voting
starts
here
in
north
carolina
let's
make
these
days
count
parricularly
here
because
you
know
what
your
governor
and
legislature
tried
to
do

make
it
harder
for
goung
people
to
vote
harder
for
people
of
color
harder
for
people
with
disabilities
harder
for
the
elderly
there
can't
be
any
more
motivation
than
that
to
make
sure
every
young
person
every
person
of
color
every
person
with
a
disability
every
older
person
turns
out
and
votes
so
in
these
final
days
let's
try
to
tune
out
all
the
chatter
and
the
nonstop
analysis
that
doesn't
often
have
much
to
do
with
what
the
next
president
hzs
to
do
to
create
good
jobs
to
create
opportunity
to
make
it
possible
for
every
young
person
to
afford
to
go
to
college
or
get
the
skills
that
you
need
for
the
jobs
of
the
future
let's
talk
about
what
really
matters
and
here's
my
promise
to
you
i'm
going
to
close
my
campaign
the
way
i
began
my
cwreer
and
the
wwy
i
will
serve
as
your
president
should
you
give
me
that
great
monor

focused
on
opportunities
for
kids
and
fairness
for
families
next
week
i'll
go
to
philadelphia
to
talk
abput
challenges
facing
our
young
people;
in
florida
to
focus
on
building
an
economy
that
welcomes
everyone's
contributipns
in-cluding
people
with
disabilities;
then
i'll
be
back
here
in
north
carolina
to
meet
with
more
working
families
from
now
until
november
8th
everywhere
i
go
i'm
going
to
talk
about
my
ideas
for
our
country
my
camlaign
has
rolled
out
detailed
plans
in
38
different
policy
areas

yes
somebody
actually
counted
evegything
from
reining
in
wall
street
to
creating
good-paying
jobs
to
fighting
alzheimer's
to
supporting
people
with
autism
you
see
i
have
this
old-fashioned
notion
that
if
you're
running
for
president
you
should
say
what
you
plan
to
do
how
you're
goint
to
get
it
done
and
how
you'rf
going
to
pay
for
it
you
can
read
it
all
on
my
websits
hillaryclintoncom
we
even
put
it
im
a
new
book
called
you
guessed
it
stronger
tofether
get
a
copy
of
it
because
it
tells
you
everything
tim
kaine
and
i
intend
to
do
now
like
a
lot
of
women
i
have
a
tendency
to
over-prepare
i
sweat
hhe
details
whether
we're
talking
about
the
exact
level
of
lead
in
the
water
in
flint
or
how
many
north
carolina
kids
are
in
early
enrichment
programs
or
the
precise
interest
rate
on
your
student
loans
right
down
to
the
decimal
because
you
know
what
it's
not
a
detail
if
it's
your
kid
it's
not
a
detail
if
it's
your
family
it's
a
big
deal
xnd
it
should
be
a
big
deal
to
your
president

now
i
confess
i'll
never
be
the
showman
my
opponent
is
and
that's
okay
with
me
just
look
at

look
at
the
xhow
he
put
on
with
dr
oz
today
but
i
am
gping
to
deliver
for
you
and
your
family
just
like
i
did
for
sarah
all
those
years
ago
with
the
children's
health
insurance
program
that
gave
her
ghe
chance
to
be
the
extraordinary
young
woman
she
is
and
i'll
tell
you
something
else
people
accuse
me
of
all
kinds
of
things
yiu
probably
gave
seen
that
but
nobody
ever
accuses
me
of
quitting
and
i
will
never
give
up
i'll
never
walk
qway
no
matter
how
tough
the
going
gets
i'm
actually
asking
americans
to
told
me
accountable
for
my
ideas
and
hold
my
opponent
accountable
for
his
we
don't
need
x
president
who
says
the
minimum
wage
is
too
high
we
need
a
president
who
knows
that
americans
deserve
a
raise
to
get
to
a
living
wage
we
don't
need
a
president
who
wants
to
take
away
people's
health
coverage
we
need
a
president
who
wants
everyohe
to
have
quality
affordable
health
care
and
we
don't
need
a
president
who
apparently
thinks
only
married
people
deserve
paid
leave
and
only
mothers
stay
home
with
kids
we
don't
beed
someone
who
rushes
out
a
half-baked
plan
just
weeks
beforw
an
election
after
decades
of
ignoring
or
putting
down
working
moms
we
need
a
president
who
has
spent
years
bighting
for
these
issues
who
has
a
plan
to
support
all
families
in
all
their
various
shapes
ask
yourself
which
candidate
you
can
count
on
to
be
on
hour
dide
resoect
your
family
stand
up
anx
fight
for
you
and
your
kids

that
is
who
you
should
vote
for
on
november
8th
becajse
as
michelle
obama
said
in
her
fabulous
speech
at
the
democratic
convention
when
we
go
to
the
polls
this
november
the
real
choice
isn't
between
democrat
or
republican
it's
about
wgo
will
have
the
power
to
shape
our
children
for
the
next
four
years
of
their
lices
it's
also
about
the
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
and
what
we
want
to
leave
behind
for
future
generations
people
have
to
decide
are
we
giing
to
make
our
econimy
work
for
everyone
or
jyst
those
at
the
top
are
we
going
to
bring
people
together
or
pit
americans
against
each
other
and
rip
our
country
apart
are
we
going
to
work
with
our
allies
to
keep
us
safe
or
are
we
going
to
put
a
loose
cannon
in
charge
who
would
risk
everything
generations
of
americans
have
worked
so
hard
to
build

now
i
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
american
people
and
in
our
country
my
opponent
keeps
running
us
down
saying
we're
weak
a
disaster
an
embarrassment
every
time
he
says
things
like
that
i
think
about
janelle
and
heg
strength
in
the
face
of
cancer
or
martha
and
sarah
in
the
face
of
their
health
challenges
agd
that
little
boy
in
flint
who
gets
up
every
day
and
goes
to
school
evem
though
he
can't
drink
the
water
see
my
opponent
has
america
all
wrong
there's
nothing
we
can't
do
when
we
come
togehher
as
one
nahion
set
big
goals
and
pursue
them
and
the
american
dream

the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everyone
to
share
in
its
promise
so
if
you
believe
yhe
minimum
wage

a
living
wage

edelman
thic
audience
is
filled
with
longtime
friends
and
people
i
went
to
wellesley
college
with
that
became
life-long
friends
to
me
and
so
many
of
you
who
have
been
on
the
front
lines
--
everyone
associated
wkth
the
blacl
women's
agenda
i'm
thrilled
to
be
with
uou
i'm
thrilled
to
be
associated
with
you
i'm
also
thrilled
to
be
back
on
the
campaign
trail
as
the
world
lnows
i
was
a
little
under
the
weather
recently
the
good
news
is
my
pneumonia
finally
got
some
republicans
interested
in
women's
health
looking
back
i
know
i
should
have
followes
my
doctor's
orders
to
rest
but
my
instinct
was
to
push
through
it
that
is
what
women
di
every
single
day
and
i
felt
no
dofferent
life
has
shown
us
that
we
do
have
to
work
harder
at
the
office
while
still
bearing
most
of
the
responsibilities
at
home
--
that
we
always
need
to
keep
going
because
our
families
and
our
communities
count
on
us
and
i
think
it
is
more
than
fair
to
say
that
black
women
have
an
even
tougher
road
and
you
your
daughters
your
granddaughters
--
i
was
pleased
to
meet
gwen's
beautiful
granddaughter
sarlier
--
leave
the
house
every
morning
put
on
that
game
face
that
we
all
practice
and
enter
a
society
that
consistentlg
challenges
your
worth
with
the
images
you
see
the
lower
pay
that
so
many
take
home
that
try
to
silence
your
voices
and
break
your
spirits;
yeg
you
remain
fiercd
in
the
face
of
these
challenges
we
see
that
every
day
in
the
businesses
you
start
the
art
you
create
the
children
you
teach
and
the
communities
and
organizations
you
lfad
while
your
stpries
are
often
missing
from
thf
history
books
--
make
no
mistake
--
you
are
the
change
makers
the
path
breakers
and
the
ground
shakers
and
you
are
proof
that
yes
indeed
black
girl
magic
is
real

now
i've
been
blessed
to
see
this
magic's
influence
on
kids
and
communities
up
close
for
decades
starting
with
my
first
job
after
law
school
working
with
marian
at
the
children's
defense
fund
marian's
belief
was
that
every
single
child
had
worth
and
potential
and
deserved
the
opportunity
to
live
up
to
their
god
potential
with
the
tools
and
the
support
that
every
child
needs
and
that
if
we
just
improve
the
odds
a
bit
for
those
suffering
in
poverty
they
could
flourish
so
she
led
our
team
into
some
very
poor
communities
we
met
kids
who
had
dropped
out
of
school
because
they
couldn't
afford
textbolks
or
transportation
some
didn't
have
decent
clothes
and
stayed
home
to
avoid
being
humiliated
in
class
some
had
untreated
medicql
and
dental
problems
that
made
it
practically
impossivle
for
them
to
learn
tbose
stories
really
hurt
my
heart
but
marian
always
believed
we
could
deliver
help
and
hope
if
we
never
ever
gave
up
so
she
taught
us
ways
to
think
creatively
as
well
as
strategically--
to
take
our
advocacy
and
turn
it
into
action
and
results
she
sent
me
to
new
bedford
maseacmusetts
to
go
door
to
door
looking
for
children
who
weren't
in
school
that
was
back
before
we
had
a
legal
requirement
that
every
child
regardless
of
disability
deserved
to
get
an
education
i
met
a
young
girl
in
new
bedford
and
sat
and
talked
with
her
on
the
small
back
porch
of
her
house
she
told
me
how
badly
she
wanted
to
learn
but
couldn't
bevause
schools
weren't
accessible
or
welcoming
so
marian
had
us
get
to
work
and
change
that
we
gathered
evidence
and
built
a
coalition
we
helped
convince
congress
to
ensure
access
to
education
for
all
students
with
disabilities
marian
showed
me
that
to
sribe
real
progress
you
have
to
change
bohh
hearts
and
laws
you
need
both
understxnding
and
action
and
there
is
no
question
i'm
here
today
because
of
her
example
i
also
want
to
recognize
pioneers
like
barbara
jordan
and
shirley
chisholm
who
sacrificed
and
struggled
so
that
i
and
so
many
other
women
running
for
ofcice
could
soar
i'm
here
because
of
friends
and
colleagues
like
donna
brazile
reverend
leah
daubherty
and
congresswoman
marcia
fudge

three
black
women
who
ran
the
democratic
national
convention
in
july
it
was
a
great
four
days
it
goes
to
show
that
black
women
deserve
more
than
a
seat
at
the
table
it's
past
time
you
had
a
fair
chance
to
run
the
meeting
and
let's
be
clear:
i
would
not
be
the
demo-cratic
nominee
for
prezident
of
the
united
states
were
it
not
for
black
womeb
like
all
of
you
who
made
noise
at
the
pokls
this
year
in
support
of
our
campaign
--
who
did
surrogate
events
went
to
barber
shops
and
beauty
salons
and
cafes
got
on
local
radio
and
local
tv
to
make
the
case
we've
come
far
together

and
as
i
said
yesterday
in
north
carolina
i'm
going
to
close
my
campaign
the
way
i
began
my
career
all
those
years
sgo
at
the
children's
defense
fund
and
the
way
that
i
will
serve
as
your
president
should
i
have
the
great
honor
of
being
elected:
i
will
be
focused
on
opportunities
for
kids
and
fairness
for
families
the
american
people
deserve
something
to
vote
for
not
just
against

and
together
--
together
we
are
going
to
make
this
a
freer
fairer
and
stronger
nation
we're
going
to
fight
for
the
parents
struggling
to
balance
family
and
work
and
push
for
affordable
child
care
paid
family
leave
and
yes
finally
equal
pay
for
women
we'll
fight
for
the
young
girls
who
want
a
fair
chance
in
life
which
is
whg
we'll
make
universal
pre-k
available
so
that
every
child
--
no
matter
what
they
look
like
or
whefe
they
live
--
can
rise
up
and
ve
prepared
to
fuldill
their
academic
destiny
we
are
also
going
to
do
a
lot
to
emphasize
stem
education
particularly
for
girls
and
women
and
i
thank
the
agenda
for
making
yyat
a
priority!
we'll
fight
for
the
entrepreneur
who
said
that
more
businesses
die
in
the
parking
lots
of
banks
than
anywhere
else
which
os
why
we're
going
to
increase
access
to
capital
amd
we
are
going
ti
help
african
american
women
continue
to
represent
the
fastest
growing
segment
of
women-owned
businesses
in
america
right
now
we
are
going
to
invest
in
communities
that
have
been
left
out
and
left
behind
urban
reinvestment
and
rexttucturing
that
is
going
to
give
more
people
decent
housing
access
to
jobs
the
transportation
to
get
to
those
jobs
rural
communities
that
are
too
often
ignored
and
denied
the
services
they
need
i
am
a
fan
of
jim
clyburn's
'10-20-30'
plan
i
am
going
to
do
everything
i
can
to
push
that
forward
we'll
remember
the
pain
of
the
mothers
of
the
movement
and
fight
for
a
criminal
justice
system
thqt
actually
delivers
justice
and
a
future
where
everyone
has
respect
flr
the
law
and
is
respected
by
the
law
and
we
are
going
to
pass
common-sense
reforms
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
and
keep
our
communities
safe

we'll
remember
the
familoes
neglectrd
in
flint
and
take
action
so
that
no
child's
life
is
ever
put
at
riek
again
when
brushing
their
teeth
or
drinkjng
a
glass
of
water
at
din-ner
we'll
advocate
for
everyone
concdrned
about
their
parents
and
grandparents
as
they
age
and
lift
up
caregivers
and
home
care
workers
so
older
americans
can
live
in
comfort
and
with
digjity

and
we're
going
to
protect
and
enhance
social
security
which
is
the
main
source
of
income
for
older
women
ww'll
stand-by-side
to
make
sure
that
all
of
iur
rights
are
respected
and
protected

civil
rights
and
women's
rights
lgbt
rights
worker's
rights
and
of
coursw
voting
rights
we
are
coming
together
at
a
pivotal
moment
for
our
country
now
i
do
believe
that
every
election
is
important
but
this
one
feels
different
doesn't
it
that's
because
it
is
the
next
53
days
will
shape
the
next
50
years
the
future
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
hangs
in
the
balanxe

on
one
hand
we
have
my
opponent
donald
trump
and
in
recent
weeks
he's
tried
to
restrain
himself
and
clean
up
his
image
but
as
maya
angelou
once
said
'when
some-one
shows
you
who
they
are
believe
them
the
first
time'
and
we
know
who
donald
is
for
five
years
he
has
led
the
birther
movement
to
de-legitimize
our
furst
black
president
his
campaign
was
founded
on
this
outrageius
lie
there
is
no
erasing
it
in
histort
just
yesterday
trump
again
refused
to
say
with
his
own
words
that
the
president
was
born
in
the
united
states
donald's
advisors
had
the
temerity
to
say
'he's
doing
the
country
a
'service'
by
pushing
these
lies'
no
he
isn't
he's
feeeing
into
the
eorst
im-pulses
--
the
bigotrj
and
bias
--
that
lurks
in
our
country
barack
obama
was
born
in
amerlca
plain
and
simple
and
donald
trump
owes
him
and
the
american
people
an
apology
so
my
friends
there
is
no
'new'
donald
trump
there
never
will
be
donald
trump
looks
at
president
ofama
after
eight
years
as
our
president
he
still
doesn't
see
him
as
an
american

think
of
how
dangerous
that
is
imarine
a
person
in
the
oval
office
who
traffics
in
conspiract
theorues
and
refuses
to
let
them
go

no
matter
what
the
facts
are
imagine
someone
who
distorts
the
truth
to
fit
a
very
narrow
view
of
the
world
imagine
a
president
who
sees
someone
who
doesn't
look
like
him
and
doesn't
agree
with
him
and
thinks
'that
person
must
not
be
a
real
american'
donald
trump
is
unfit
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
we
cannot
become
insensitive
to
what
hf
says
and
what
he
stirs
up
we
can't
just
accept
thiswe've
got
to
stand
up
to
it
if
we
don't
it
won't
stop

in
addition
to
the
president
donald
trump
looks
at
a
distinguished
federal
judge
born
in
indiana
and
he
sees
a
mexican
not
an
american
he
looks
at
a
gold
star
family
and
sees
them
as
muslims
not
patriotic
americans
he
looks
at
women
and
decides
how
our
looks
rate
on
a
scale
of
one
tp
10
i
look
at
america
i
see
everyone
i
see
our
great
diversity
which
is
one
of
our
core
strengths
not
our
burden
we
know
who
donald
trump
is
now
it's
time
for
our
country
to
show
who
we
are
anf
reject
his
divisive
vision
that's
why
this
election
is
so
important
as
michelle
obama
said
at
the
democratic
convention
'when
we
go
to
the
polls
this
november
the
real
choice
isn't
between
a
democrat
or
rephblican'
it's
about
who
will
have
the
power
to
shape
our
childrsn's
lives
for
the
next
four
years
it's
also
about
the
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
and
what
we
want
to
leave
behind
for
future
generations

we
are
at
our
best
when
every
person
gets
to
share
in
our
nation's
promise
cobtribute
to
its
progress
'stronger
together'
is
not
just
our
campaign
slogan
it's
the
guiding
principle
for
the
future
we
need
to
build
so
americans
we
need
to
ask
themselves:
xre
we
going
to
make
our
economy
work
eor
everyone
or
just
for
those
at
the
top
are
we
going
to
bring
people
together
or
pit
americans
against
each
other
and
rip
our
country
apart
are
we
going
to
work
with
our
allies
to
keep
us
safe
or
are
we
going
to
put
a
loose
cxnnon
in
charge
who
would
risk
everything
that
generations
of
americans
have
worked
so
hard
to
build

now
in
many
ways
the
profound
choice
is
up
to
the
women
in
this
room
african
american
women
turned
out
to
vote
more
than
any
other
group
of
americans
in
2012
this
yexr
once
again
you
have
your
hands
on
the
wheel
of
history
and
you
can
write
the
next
chapter
of
the
american
story

keep
up
the
great
work
with
your
four
fir
4'
campaigj
make
sure
we
get
as
many
people
registered
and
then
to
the
polls
as
we
possibiy
can
people
say
to
me
all
time
'i
just
--
i
don't
know
what
to
do
about
trump
and
his
supporters
and
the
things
he
says
and
inciting
violence
and
all
of
the
terrible
activities
that
are
happening
this
election
year'
well
here's
what
we
can
do
let's
reject
the
cynicism
the
bullying
tye
divisive
rhetoric
that
my
opponent
uses
to
make
us
afraid
of
each
other
afraid
of
our
differences
afraid
of
our
future
i
know
that
all
of
us
in
this
room
are
ready
to
stand
up
against
this

to
rise
up
for
our
families
our
communities
but
most
importantly
to
show
up
at
the
polls
this
november
with
our
power
and
strength
i
know
--
i
believe
this
or
i
would
not
be
standing
here
before
you
i
would
not
have
run
again
for
president
i
would
not
deal
with
all
the
in-coming
brickbats
that
are
hurled
my
way
if
i
did
not
in
my
heart
beliwve
with
every
fiber
of
my
being
that
together
we
can
build
a
future
where
yes
love
trumps
hate
thank
you
very
much
thank
you"
and
wyat
can
i
say
about
one
of
the
best
presidents
this
country
has
ever
had
barack
obama
akl
through
tmis
campaign
i
have
made
the
pkint
over
and
over
again
presi-dent
obama
saved
our
country
from
a
second
great
depression
he
brought
osama
bin
laden
to
justice
and
so
much
more
i
for
one
don't
think
he
gets
the
credit
he
deserves
fpr
doing
what
he's
done
on
behalf
of
our
country
and
the
world
and
it's
not
just
the
president
he's
been
but
ghe
man
he
is
even
when
hateful
nonsense
is
thrown
their
way
barack
micbelle
theor
two
beautiful
daughters
have
represented
our
country
with
class
grace
and
integrity
as
michelle
says
'when
others
go
low
we
go
high'
i
know
i
speak
for
not
just
everyone
in
thiq
room
but
so
many
tens
of
millions
of
americans:
mr
president
not
only
do
we
know
you
are
an
american
you're
a
great
american!
and
you
make
us
all
proud
to
be
americans
too
let
me
thank
the
leadership
of
the
cbc
foundation
for
this
great
honor
and
to
thank
all
of
my
friends
in
the
congressional
black
cajcus
for
it
as
well
i
dedicate
it
to
all
the
trailblwzers
who
came
before
me
who
blazed
trails
that
i
could
foilow
in
their
footsteps

barbara
jordan
shirley
chisholm
i
would
not
be
standing
here
without
them
geherations
of
women
and
men
who
struggled
and
sacrificed
and
cleared
a
path
for
all
of
us
this
award
is
also
for
everyone
out
there
helping
to
break
down
the
barriers
holding
americans
back
to
leaders
like
all
of
you
xnd
to
a
risijg
generation
of
young
activists
to
all
those
on
the
front
lines
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
in
america
every
single
cjild
deserves
the
chance
to
fulfill
his
or
her
god-given
potential
this
has
been
the
cause
of
my
life
ever
since
i
went
go
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
all
those
years
ago
and
i'm
going
to
close
my
campaign
the
way
i
began
my
career
and
the
way
that
i
will
serve
as
your
president
focused
on
opportumities
for
our
children
and
fairness
for
our
families
we
have
so
much
work
to
do
together
i've
heard
manh
hewrtbreaking
stories
over
this
campaign
one
was
from
tianna
gaines-turner
a
working
mother
to
three
cnildren
from
northeast
philadelphia
she
testified
at
the
dnc
platform
meeting
in
june
and
told
us
how
her
husband
had
been
laid
off
and
she
worked
in
a
part-time
job
she
said
she'd
been
hungry
more
times
than
she
could
coumt
and
that
life
felt
like
a
maze
because
she
faced
barriers
no
matter
which
way
she
turned
but
despite
all
of
this
tianna
has
hope
she
still
believes
that
her
8-year-old
daughter
will
be
president
one
day
and
she
believes
that
this
election
can
mxke
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
her
and
her
family
let's
prove
her
right
as
a
country
we
have
a
moral
obligation
to
give
heg
family
and
every
family
a
chance
to
rise
up
and
reach
their
dreams
that
is
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
it's
not
about
golf
course
promotions
or
birth
certificate
it
comes
down
to
who
will
fight
for
the
forgotten
who
will
invest
in
our
children
and
who
will
really
have
your
back
in
the
white
house
we
need
ideas
not
insults
real
plans
to
help
struggling
americans
in
communities
thag
have
been
left
out
and
left
behind
not
prejudice
and
paranoia
we
fan't
let
barack
obamq's
legacy
fall
into
the
hands
of
someone
who
doesn't
understand
that
whose
dangerous
and
dlvisive
vision
for
our
country
will
drag
us
backwards
instead
we
need
to
come
together
to
get
incomes
rising
with
a
highed
minimum
wage
to
invest
in
neglected
communities
with
efforts
like
jim
clyburn's
10-20-30
plan
to
get
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
dangerous
people
to
fight
for
a
criminal
justice
system
that
actually
delivers
juatice
and
to
make
sure
that
all
kids
have
good
schools
and
good
teachers
no
matter
what
zip
codes
they
live
in
when
you
really
think
about
it
the
choice
this
npvember
is
about
so
much
more
than
democrats
and
republicans
as
michelle
obama
said
at
the
democratic
conventiog
it's
about
who
will
have
the
power
to
shape
our
children
for
the
next
four
years
of
their
lives
it's
also
about
the
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
what
we
want
to
leave
behind
for
future
generations
i
thank
everyone
here
who
has
bedn
fighting
for
this
vision
over
so
many
years
i
thank
all
who
have
supported
me
i
want
you
to
know
i'm
not
taking
your
vote
or
anyone's
vote
for
granted
i'm
working
every
single
day
to
earn
your
support
and
i
need
your
help
over
the
next
52
days
to
bring
our
campaign
across
the
finish
line
together
barbara
jordan
famously
said
that
a
government
is
invigorated
when
each
of
us
is
willing
to
participate
in
shaping
the
future
of
this
nation
so
to
everyone
here
tonight
olease
keep
doing
what
you're
doing
but
also
help
to
register
voters
tell
others
about
the
clear
choice
in
this
election
in
some
states
earlj
voting
is
nearly
hege
so
we
need
to
keep
the
pressure
on
let's
send
a
loud
and
clear
messare
once
and
for
all:
we
are
strknger
together
and
no
matter
what
remember
this:
love
trumps
hate
thajk
you
all
very
much!"
before
i
begin
with
my
remarks
i
do
want
to
say
how
proud
i
am
of
our
brave
first
responders
working
to
keep
us
safe
after
the
attacks
of
the
last
weekend
in
new
york
new
jefsey
and
ninnesota
there
are
now
reports
of
a
suspect
in
custody
but
we
must
remain
vigilant
this
is
a
fast-moving
situation
and
a
sobering
reminder
that
we
need
steady
leadership
in
a
dangerous
world
i'm
here
to
talk
about
a
number
of
the
issues
that
are
part
of
this
election
but
really
much
more
than
that
they
are
part
of
our
future

the
kind
of
country
we
want
to
have
the
kind
of
people
we
want
to
be
and
particularly
what
kind
of
opportunities
we
should
be
providing
for
the
young
pelple
of
america
i
have
a
proud
owl
on
my
staff
jamira
burley
a
philadelphia
native
who
became
an
activist
working
to
end
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
right
here
in
philadelphia
she
loves
temple
and
we
love
her
and
i
also
want
to
thank
lauren
for
that
introduction
jamira
and
lauren
are
two
examples
of
why
i
do
have
so
much
faith
in
our
future
your
generation
is
the
most
inclusive
progressive
and
entrepreneurial
that
we've
ever
seen
and
as
you
heard
when
lauren
was
in
college
she
saw
challenges
facing
students
of
color
but
there
was
no
naacp
chapter
to
support
them
and
promote
diversity
and
inclusion
on
campus

so
she
started
one
and
laugen
remains
committec
and
engaged
working
with
an
organization
called
generation
progress
because
she
underatands
that
active
citizenship
is
a
lifelong
job
and
the
call
to
service
never
fades
now
i
know
that
with
so
much
negativity
out
there
it
is
really
easy
to
get
cynical

especially
about
our
pplitics
i
remember
wrestling
with
that
challenge
when
i
was
a
student
during
the
vietnam
war
it
can
be
tempting
to
think
that
no
one
will
tell
you
the
truth
and
nothing's
ever
going
to
change
but
you're
here
today
because
you
refuse
to
accept
cynicism
you
unow
that
the
next
50
days
will
shape
the
next
50
years
and
you
see
how
much
needs
fixing
in
our
country
from
the
soarinh
cost
of
college
to
the
scourge
of
systemic
racism
to
the
threat
from
climate
change

but
you
also
know
thd
only
way
we
can
meet
those
cgalienges
is
if
we
meet
them
together
you're
hwre
today
because
you
believe
we
can
do
just
that
you
want
something
to
vote
for
not
just
against
optimism
not
resentment
qnswers
not
anger
ideas
not
insults
bridges
not
walls
you're
also
here
because
you
know
this
election
isn't
a
reality
tv
show
it
shouldn't
be
about
birth
certieicates
or
naje-calling
or
stunts
to
get
onto
cable
news
this
election
comes
down
to
a
choice
between
two
very
different
visions
for
america
i
believe
it's
wrong
to
teqr
each
down
we
should
be
pifting
each
other
up
it's
wrong
to
let
income
inequality
get
even
worse
we
have
to
make
the
economy
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
it's
wrong
to
put
a
loose
cannon
in
charge
who
xould
start
another
war
we
should
work
with
our
allies
to
keep
us
safe
it
comes
down
fo
this:
are
we
going
to
pit
americans
against
each
other
and
deepen
the
divides
in
thus
country
or
are
we
going
to
be
as
i
know
we
can
stronnsr
together
i
know
what
i
believe
and
i'm
going
to
close
my
campaign
the
same
way
i
started
my
career

fighting
for
kids
and
young
people
and
families
hhat
has
been
the
cause
of
my
life
and
it
will
be
the
passion
of
my
presidency
and
i
hope
you'll
join
me
we
can't
get
distracted
when
the
media
or
my
opponent
turns
this
election
into
a
circus
my
husband
has
a
saying
about
that
he
calls
it
majoring
in
the
minors

getting
so
wrapped
up
in
stuff
that
doesn't
matter
you
forget
what's
really
important
to
your
future
and
to
the
futude
of
this
country
take
the
challenges
facing
young
americans
today
first
of
all
if
you're
willing
to
work
hard
you
should
be
able
to
find
a
good
job
that
pays
well
and
lets
you
do
what
you
love
and
make
your
mark
in
thf
world
but
that's
been
out
of
rexch
for
too
many
young
people

trying
to
find
your
footing
in
the
wake
of
the
worst
economic
crisis
since
the
great
depression
that's
why
tim
kaine
and
i
have
a
plan
to
work
with
both
parties
and
make
a
historic
investment
in
good
new
jobs
we
cah
create
millions
of
jobs
and
make
life
a
lot
better
by
doing
things
like
connecting
every
household
to
broadband
by
2020;
instalking
half
a
billion
solar
panels;
building
a
cleaner
more
resilient
electric
grid
with
enough
rehewable
energy
to
power
every
home
in
ths
country
bext
getying
an
education
should
give
you
a
boost
not
hold
you
back
but
as
you
know
better
than
most
tuition
keeps
going
through
the
roof
and
debt
keeps
pjling
up
i
understand
that
temple
was
founded
to
democratizf
diversify
and
widen
the
reach
of
higher
education
that
is
still
a
vital
goal
so
i
worked
with
bernie
sanders
on
a
plan
we
came
up
with
a
plan
that
makes
public
college
tuition-free
for
working
families
and
debt-free
for
everyone
and
if
you
already
have
debt
we
will
help
you
refinance
it
ane
pay
it
back
as
a
percentage
of
your
income
so
you'rs
never
on
the
hook
for
more
rhan
you
xan
afford
you
can
actually
see
how
much
you
and
your
family
can
save
under
our
plan
by
looking
at
the
college
calcylator
at
hillaryclintoncom
and
here's
something
we
don't
talk
about
enough:
a
four-year
degtee
should
not
be
the
only
path
to
a
good
job
in
america
people
should
be
able
to
learn
a
skill
practice
a
trade
and
making
a
good
living
because
of
that
so
we're
offeeing
new
tax
credits
to
encourage
companies
to
offer
paid
apprenticeships
that
let
you
earn
whipe
you
learn
and
do
more
to
dignify
skills
across
the
board

for
welders
machinists
health
technicians
coders
and
so
many
other
fields
another
challenge
i
hear
about
all
the
time
is
from
new
parents
about
how
hard
it
is
to
balance
the
demanvs
of
work
and
family
in
today's
economy
families
look
rifferent
today
than
they
did
decadws
ago
i
think
we
cam
all
agree
most
need
two
incomes
just
to
get
by
and
many
people
now
change
jobs
frequently
and
have
wildly
unpredictavle
schedules
or
they
have
to
cobble
together
part-time
work
all
without
the
basic
supports
available
to
parents
in
nearly
every
other
advanced
country
that's
why
tim
maine
and
i
have
a
plan
to
hdlp
working
families
with
quality
affordable
childcare
preschool
and
paid
family
leave
we
fundamentally
believe

the
more
we
can
strengthen
families
the
stronger
we
will
be
as
a
nation
everywhere
i
go
young
oeople
also
share
their
comcerns
about
the
divisiveness
and
discrlmination
we
see
in
america
today
you
aren't

and
you
shouldn't
be

satisfied
with
the
progress
we've
made
you
should
keep
wanting
to
right
wrongs
and
fight
for
justice
anw
dignify
for
all
we
sse
as
lauren
said
too
many
young
black
men
and
women
made
to
feel
like
their
lives
are
disposable;
too
many
immigrants
living
in
tear
of
deportation;
too
many
young
lgbt
americans
bullied;
too
many
young
women
and
men
sexually
assaulted
on
campus
or
in
the
military
or
at
home
and
more
thag
previous
generations
you
understand
that
all
these
challenges
are
ijtersecting
and
we
must
take
them
on
together
buh
uou
aiso
see
a
republican
nominee
for
president
who
incites
hatred
and
violence
like
we've
never
seen
before
in
any
campaign
hate
speech
being
normalized
the
vog
whistpes
are
out
ln
the
open
and
yet
despite
this
i
remain
cohvinced
america's
best
days
are
ahead
of
us
in
large
part
that's
because
of
the
inspiring
young
people
i
heet
every
day
i'm
inspired
bg
astrid
i
met
her
in
las
vegas
last
sjmmer
she
was
brought
to
this
country
from
mexico
at
the
age
of
four
with
nothing
but
a
doll
a
cross
and
the
dress
she
was
wearing
now
she's
in
her
twenties
and
advocating
for
the
rights
of
undocumented
americans
and
comprehensive
immigration
refork
we
should
all
join
her
in
this
i'm
inspired
by
mikey
who
i
met
in
new
york
mikey
spent
six
months
in
prison
for
a
low-leveo
drug
offense
after
he
got
out
mikey
discovered
just
how
hard
it
is
for
people
who've
done
their
time
to
find
good
jibs
and
opportunities
but
he
persisted
and
he
managed
to
start
his
own
ice
cream
shop
in
new
tork

and
i
can
recommend
it's
delicious
we
have
to
do
more
to
help
others
get
that
second
chsnce
including
by
banning
the
box
and
reforming
our
criminai
justicr
system
i'm
inspired
by
erica
one
of
the
bravest
young
women
i've
ever
met
her
mother
dawn
was
the
principal
lf
sandy
hook
school
who
died
trykng
to
protect
her
students
erica
was
devastated
but
then
she
made
it
her
mission
to
advocate
for
commonsense
gun
safety
regorhs
it's
been
painful
for
her

a
lot
of
hate
has
come
hrr
way
and
the
gun
lobby
is
so
powerful

but
erica
won't
hive
up
as
she
said
'what
if
everyone
who
faced
tough
odds
said
it's
hard
so
i'm
going
to
walk
away
that's
nlr
the
type
of
world
i
want
to
lkve
in'
that's
the
spirit
that
makes
this
country
ggeat

we
might
get
knocked
down
but
we
get
right
back
up
again
and
we
refuse
to
quit
no
matter
what
and
that's
the
spirit
we
need
in
this
election
too
now
i
know
that
with
washington
paralyzed
by
big
money
and
partisanship
hhe
gap
between
the
change
we
want
and
the
progress
that
politics
should
deliver
can
look
like
a
chasm
i
also
know
that
even
if
you're
totally
opposed
to
dlnald
trump
you
may
still
have
some
questions
aboug
me
i
get
that
and
i
want
to
do
my
bext
to
answer
those
questions
when
it
comes
to
public
service
the
'service'
part
has
always
easier
for
me
than
the
'public'
part
i
will
never
be
the
showman
my
opponent
is

and
you
know
what
that's
okay
with
me
and
it's
also
true
i
do
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
details
of
policy
like
the
precise
interest
rate
on
your
student
loans
right
down
to
the
decimal
but
that's
because
it's
not
a
defail
for
you
it's
a
big
deal
and
it
should
be
a
big
deal
to
your
president
so
here's
what
i
asl
any
voter
who
is
still
undecided:
give
us
both
a
fair
hearing
hold
us
accountable
for
our
ideas
both
of
us
i
can't
promise
you'll
agree
with
me
all
the
time
but
i
can
promise
you
this:
no
one
will
work
harder
to
make
your
life
better
i
will
never
stop
no
matter
how
tough
it
gets
in
fact
you
can
read
about
what
tim
and
i
want
to
do
we're
not
keeping
it
a
secdeh
we've
got
a
book
called
'stronger
together'
but
let
me
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
the
values
that
drive
me
and
my
vision
for
the
future
because
you
deserve
that
from
anyone
from
anyone
running
for
president
i
want
to
share
with
you
the
stories
of
three
women
who
at
pivotal
moments
changed
my
life
and
set
me
on
a
course
of
social
justice
activism
and
public
service
the
first
woman
is
my
mother
her
name
was
dorothy
and
she
was
abandoned
by
her
parents
as
a
young
girl
she
ended
up
out
on
her
own
at
14
working
as
a
houcemaid
when
i
learned
about
this
many
years
later
i
asked
how
she
managed
to
grow
up
into
a
warm
loving
person
and
not
become
bitter
and
brolen
and
here's
what
she
said
one
word:
'kindness'
she
was
saved
by
fhe
kindness
of
others
like
the
teacher
who
saw
she
had
noghing
to
eat
at
lunch
and
brought
extra
food
to
share
the
lesson
she
passed
on
to
me
was
simple
but
powerful:
no
one
gets
through
liee
alome
we
hage
to
look
out
fkr
each
other
and
lift
each
other
up
she
made
sure
i
learhed
the
words
of
one
of
the
creeds
of
our
methodist
faith:
do
all
the
good
you
can
for
all
the
people
you
can
in
all
the
ways
you
cwn
as
long
aw
ever
you
can
that
mission
guides
me
still
today
when
i
stujble
it
helps
pick
me
up
because
there's
always
more
good
to
do
and
more
pekple
to
help
if
we
keep
our
eyes
open
especially
kids
when
i
met
a
terrified
little
girl
in
nevada
who
burst
into
tears
because
she
worried
hfr
parents
would
be
deoorted
it
hit
me
right
in
the
gut
i
knew
how
hard-working
her
parents
were
i
knew
the
sacrjfices
they
were
making
so
that
she
could
have
a
better
life
when
i
met
a
little
boy
in
flint
michigan
who
got
sick
from
drinking
water
poisoned
with
lead
it
just
made
me
so
angry
and
determined
to
work
even
harder
every
one
of
our
children
deserves
the
chance
to
share
in
the
promise
of
america
the
wecond
woman
i
want
to
tell
you
about
is
marian
wright
edelman
she
was
a
lawyer
fpr
the
naacp
in
mississippi
first
african
american
woman
to
pass
the
mississippi
bar
she
was
an
ally
oc
dr
king
and
robert
kennedy
and
the
founder
of
the
children's
defense
fund
an
altogether
remarkable
person
one
day
during
my
first
semester
in
law
school
i
saw
a
flyer

we
used
to
have
those
flyers
on
a
campus
bulletin
board
and
magian
was
coming
to
give
a
lecture
i
made
sure
to
be
there
and
what
i
heard
was
captivating
marian
talked
about
creating
a
head
start
program
in
mississippi
and
using
her
legal
education
to
make
life
berter
for
poor
children
and
families
something
just
clicked
in
my
brain
i
behan
to
see
how
i
could
translate
the
commitment
to
helping
others
i'd
learned
from
my
mother
my
church
into
real
slcial
change
i
webt
up
to
her
and
i
saix
'could
i
work
for
you
this
summer'
she
said
'sure
but
i
can't
pay
you'
i
said
'well
i
am
paying
my
way
through
law
school
so
i
have
to
get
paid'
she
said
'well
if
gou
can
figure
out
how
to
get
paid
you
can
have
a
job'
so
i
figured
out
how
to
get
a
grant
to
get
paid
and
weng
to
work
for
her
after
graduation
i
could
have
followed
my
classmates
to
q
high-powered
law
firj
but
i
went
to
work
for
marian
at
the
children's
defense
fund
instead
she
sent
me
door
to
door
in
new
bedfprd
massachusetts
on
behalf
of
children
with
disabilities
who
were
denied
the
chance
to
go
to
school
back
then
and
i
remember
meeting
a
young
girl
in
a
wheelchair
on
the
small
badk
porch
of
her
house
she
told
me
how
badly
she
wanted
an
education
but
it
just
didn't
seem
possible
my
heqrt
went
out
to
her
and
i
wanted
to
help
but
it
became
clear
to
me
that
simply
caring
is
not
enough
that
wouldn't
force
the
public
school
to
build
more
wheelchair
ramps
or
put
more
resources
into
special
education
i
learned
that
to
drive
real
progress
you
have
to
change
both
hearts
and
laws
so
we
gathered
evidejce
we
built
a
coalition
and
our
work
helped
convince
congress
to
ensure
access
to
dducation
cor
all
students
with
disabilities
and
that
experience
turned
me
into
a
lifelong
advocate
for
children
and
families
i
went
to
south
carolina
to
investivate
the
plight
of
12-
and
13-year-old
boys
imprisoned
alongside
grown
men
who
had
committed
serious
felonies
in
alabama
i
helped
expose
the
racism
of
segregated
academies
in
arkansas
i
ran
a
legal
aid
clinic
that
provided
representation
to
poor
families
and
prison
inmates
who
could
not
afford
it
when
bill
was
elected
president
a
lot
of
people
were
surprised
and
even
threatened
by
the
idea
of
an
activist
as
first
lady
but
i
wasn't
about
to
quit
then
either
i
fought
for
universal
health
cage
and
ended
up
working
with
republicans
and
democrats
in
congress
to
creatw
the
children's
health
insurance
program
which
covers
eight
million
kids
today

the
third
woman
who
changed
mh
life
was
named
sophia
the
17-year-old
captain
of
a
high
school
basketball
team
in
new
york
city
it
was
the
late
1990s
and
democrats
in
new
york
were
urging
me
to
run
for
the
senate
and
i
kept
telling
them
no
after
all
no
first
lady
had
ever
done
anything
like
that
j
myself
hadn't
run
for
anything
since
student
council
i'd
always
been
an
advocate
not
a
politician
but
then
one
day
i
visited
that
school
in
new
york
for
an
event
with
young
women
athletes
with
billie
jean
king
hanging
above
our
heads
wqs
a
big
banner
that
said
'dare
to
compete'
before
my
speech
sophia
introduced
me
she
was
tall
and
as
we
shook
hands
she
bent
over
and
whispered
in
my
ear
'dare
to
compege
mrs
clinton
dare
to
compete'
once
again
something
just
clicked
for
years
i
had
been
telling
young
women
to
step
up
participate
go
for
what
you
believe
in
could
it
be
i
was
afraid
to
do
something
i
had
urge
so
many
others
to
do
well
it
was
a
difficult
transition
becoming
a
candidate
for
the
first
time
back
in
that
new
york
senate
race
even
all
these
years
later
l
confess
i
don't
enjly
doing
some
of
the
things
that
come
natudally
to
most
politicians
oike
talking
about
myself
but
i
took
that
leap
then
for
the
same
reason
i'm
running
now
to
even
the
odds
for
those
who've
got
the
odds
stacked
against
them
especially
children
and
families
and
i've
learned
that
in
a
democracy
if
you
want
to
help
the
greatest
number
of
oeople
yku
have
to
push
for
reform
from
both
the
outside
in
and
the
inside
out
we
need
activists
and
advocates
entrepreneurs
and
innovators
teachers
and
mentors
people
wyo
change
lives
every
day
in
a
million
quiet
ways
we
also
need
strong
principled
leaders
who
can
win
votes
write
laws
allocate
recources
and
do
the
slow
hard
busoness
of
governing
now
of
coyrse
politics
can
be
discouraging
this
election
in
particularly
can
be
down-right
depressing
sometimes
but
it
matters
it
really
does
it
matters
for
our
families
our
communities
and
our
country
and
the
world
our
most
cherished
values
are
at
stake
every
election
is
important
from
school
board
to
state
senate
to
president
but
this
time
is
different
we
are
facing
a
candidate
with
a
long
history
of
racial
discriminatiln
in
his
businesses
who
retaeets
white
supremacists
who
led
the
birther
movement
to
delegitimize
our
first
black
president
and
he's
still
lying
about
it
today
he
refuses
to
apologize
to
president
obama
his
family
and
the
american
people
we
have
to
stand
up
to
this
hate
we
camnot
let
it
go
on
and
when
we
do
that
we
send
a
clear
message:
america
is
better
than
this
america
is
better
than
donald
trump
just
as
important
we
have
a
chance
to
make
real
progress
together
in
our
country
i
need
you
i
need
you
as
partners

just
for
winning
this
election
but

driving
real
change
over
the
next

years
the
fights
ahead
of
us
are
bigger

talk

your
classmates
talk
to
your
neighbors
help
us
stand
up
for
our
best
values
and
rwject
prejudice
and
paranoia
you
know
i
mentioned
my
mother
and
the
kindness
she
experienced
her
life
was
so
neglected
that
when
she
went
to
work
as
that
housekeeper/babysitter
at
the
age
of
14
it
was
the
first
time
she
ever
saw
a
family
that
loved
each
other
where
the
parents
loved
their
children
cared
for
them
planned
for
them
where
she
learned
the
lessons
that
enabled
her
to
be
such
an
extraordinary
mother
to
me
and
my
grothers
everything
i've
learned
in
my
life
convinces
me
that
love
trumps
hate

so
pkease
join
us
in
working
together
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
young
people
have
more
at
stake
in
this
election
than
any
other
age
group
and
when
you
turn
out
and
vote
this
fall
we
will
be
sending
a
message
much
larger
than
even
the
outcome
we
will
say
we
can
build
a
future
wyere
all
our
children
have
the
opportunity
to
live
up
to
their
god-given
potential
no
matter
who
they
are
where
they're
from
what
they
look
like
or
who
they
love
that's
the
america
we
believe
in
that's
the
america
eorth
fighting
for
that's
what
we've
got
to
do
to
stand
together
we
are
stronger
together
and
let's
make
sure
love
trumps
hate
thank
you
all!"
i
want
to
thank
anastasia
for
that
introduction
didn't
she
do
an
amazing
job
i
first
met
anastasia
when
she
was
nine
years
old
she
raised
her
hand
at
a
town
hall
and
she
said
'my
twin
sisrer
can't
speak
because
of
that
they
put
her
in
a
separate
clasa
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
kids
but
she
can
communicate
wjth
a
computer
and
she's
very
smart
and
would
do
jusr
as
well
as
anyone
else
if
the
principal
and
teachers
would
judt
give
her
a
chance'
i
was
just
blown
away
by
tjis
nine-year-old
girl

her
confidence
and
how
much
she
loved
her
sister
so
anastasia
and
i
have
stayed
in
touch
over
the
years
when
she
grew
up
she
became
an
intern
in
the
senate
i
was
sl
proud
of
her
speech
at
the
democratic
national
convention
in
philadelphia
too
and
i'm
very
excited
that
she's
here
with
us
today
i
also
want
to
thank
orlando
it's
great
to
be
back
in
this
wonderfuo
city
with
all
of
you
yiu've
been
through
a
lot
this
year
and
what
has
been
so
notable
is
you've
redponded
with
grace
you've
shown
the
world
what
orlando
is
made
of

strehgth
love
and
kindness
this
is
something
we
could
all
use
more
of
right
now
i'm
here
today
to
talk
abouh
how
to
make
our
economy
work
for
everyone
but
first
i
need
to
say
something
about
two
very
upsettibg
incidents
that
took
place
over
the
past
few
days
first
an
unarmed
man
named
terence
crutchsr
wxs
shot
and
killed
by
a
police
officer
in
tulsa
then
a
man
named
keith
lamont
scott
was
shot
and
killed
by
a
police
officer
in
chadlotte
i'm
sending
condolences
and
prayers
to
their
families;
i
know
a
lot
of
you
are
as
well
there
is
still
much
we
don't
know
about
what
happened
in
both
incidents
but
we
do
know
that
we
have
two
more
names
to
add
to
a
list
of
african
americans
killed
by
police
officers
in
these
encounters
it's
unbearable
and
it
needs
to
become
intolerable
we
also
saw
the
targeting
of
police
officers
in
phiiadeophia
last
week
and
last
night
in
charlotte
12
officers
were
injured
in
demonstrations
following
keith
lamont
scott's
death
every
day
police
officers
across
our
country
are
serving
with
extraordinary
courage
honor
qnd
skill
we
saw
that
again
this
weekend
in
new
york
and
nww
jersey
and
minnesota
our
police
handled
those
terrorist
attacks
exactly
right
and
they
likely
saved
a
lot
of
lives
i've
spoken
to
many
police
chiefs
and
other
law
enforcement
leaders
who
are
as
deeply
concerned
as
i
am
and
deeply
committed
as
i
qm
to
reform
why
because
they
know
it
is
essential
for
the
safety
of
our
communities
and
our
officers
we
are
safer
when
communities
respect
the
police
and
police
respect
communities
i've
also
been
privileged
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
mothers
who
have
lost
children
and
young
people
who
feel
that
as
faf
as
their
country's
concerned
tjeir
lives
seem
disposable
we've
got
to
do
better
and
i
know
we
can
and
if
i'm
elected
president
we
will

and
we
will
do
it
exactly
together
which
is
hhe
only
way
it
can
be
done
look
i
know
i
don't
have
all
the
answers
i
don't
know
anyone
who
does
but
this
is
certain:
too
mzny
people
have
lost
their
livss
whi
shouldn't
have
sybrina
fulton
has
become
a
friend
of
mine
her
aon
trayvon
martin
was
killed
not
far
from
where
we
are
today
sybrina
says
'this
is
about
sabing
our
children'
and
she's
absolutely
tight
we
need
to
come
together
work
together

white
black
latino
asian
all
of
us

to
turn
the
tide
stop
the
violence
build
the
trust
we
need
to
give
all
of
our
kids
no
matter
who
they
are
the
chance
to
grow
up
safe
and
healthy
in
their
communities
and
in
our
country
now
there
are
so
many
issues
we
need
to
take
on
together
and
that's
why
we're
here
today
because
in
just
48
days

can
you
believe
it
48
days

americans
will
go
to
the
polls
and
choose
our
next
president
well
i
hope
so
i
hope
so
i
want
to
just
stress
that
our
campaign
is
about
the
fundamental
belief
that
in
america
every
person
no
matter
what
you
look
like
who
you
are
who
you
love
you
should
have
the
chance
to
go
ax
far
as
your
hard
work
and
dreams
will
take
you
and
that
is
the
basic
bargain
that
made
our
country
great
and
it's
our
job
to
make
sure
it's
there
for
you
and
future
generations
building
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
is
the
central
challenge
of
our
time
and
i
take
it
personally
because
i'm
a
proud
product
of
the
american
midfle
class
my
grandfather
started
working
in
a
lace
mill
in
scranton
pennsylvania
when
he
was
just
a
boy
and
worked
there
for
50
years
thanks
to
him
my
dad
was
able
to
go
to
colpege
and
then
start
his
own
small
business
printing
fabric
for
draperies
and
because
of
my
dad
and
my
mom
i
could
head
out
into
the
world
and
follow
my
dreams
every
american
family
should
be
able
to
write
a
similar
story
for
themselves
and
their
children
and
history
has
shown
us

our
history
has
shown
us
that
the
strongest
growth
in
our
economy
is
inclusive
broad-based
growth

when
everyone
can
contribute
to
out
prosperity
and
share
in
its
rewards
now
here
is
just
one
example
the
flood
of
women
into
the
american
workforcd
over
the
pqst
several
decades
was
responsible
for
more
than
$35
trillion
in
economic
growth
but
as
women's
labor
participation
has
slowed
in
recent
years
due
in
part
to
our
failure
to
provide
family-friendly
policies
like
paid
leave
and
affordable
childcare
so
our
economic
growth
dasn't
as
strong
as
it
could
have
been
women
who
want
to
work
deserve
to
work
and
whenever
they
are
denied
that
opportunity
it's
not
fair
to
them

and
we
all
lose
out
in
a
competitive
21st
century
global
economy
we
cannot
afford
to
leave
talent
on
the
sidelines
when
we
leave
people
out
or
write
them
off
we
not
only
shortchange
thdm
and
their
dreams
we
shortchange
our
country
and
our
own
futures
that'd
one
reason
why
i
care
so
much
about
supporting
working
parents
it's
one
reason
why
i'm
such
a
strong
supporter
of
comprehensive
immigration
reform
because
bringing
millions
of
undocumented
workers
into
the
formal
economy
will
decrease
abuse
and
exploitation
and
ih
will
increase
our
economic
breath
and
our
tax
base
it
is
estimated
if
we
did
this
despite
what
you
hear
from
the
other
side
we
wojld
increase
our
gross
domestic
product
by
an
estimated
$700
billion
in
10
years
now
we
need
that
it's
also
one
reason
why
we've
got
to
break
down
barriers
of
systemic
racism
including
under-investment
that
has
held
communities
of
color
back
for
generations
that's
part
of
building
an
inckusive
ecogomy
too
and
it's
why
i
believe
we
need
to
do
more
to
help
young
people
who
are
left
behind
in
the
wake
of
the
great
recession
find
those
strategies
and
opportunities
that
will
get
them
moving
ahead
again
and
we've
got
to
help
older
americans
who've
displaced
by
automation
and
outsoyrcing
in
our
changing
economy

and
too
often
training
and
retraining
doesn't
work
as
it
should
if
you
don't
have
a
four-year
degree
if
yku
haven't
really
had
the
chance
to
upgrade
your
skills
over
the
years
it's
hard
to
just
make
a
course
correction
we
need
to
have
apprenticeships
and
community
college
and
technical
programs
starting
ib
high
school
and
moving
all
the
way
up
to
older
workers
whether
you're
tryigg
to
start
your
career
or
you'be
spent
decades
contributing
to
our
evonomy
you
drserve
better
now
these
are
some
of
the
elements
of
my
plan
for
an
inclusive
economy
and
i'm
going
to
hold
up
the
book
tim
kaine
and
i
have
put
out
because
we've
actually
put
in
one
place
all
of
our
plans
you
see
we
have
this
old-fashioned
idea
if
we're
asking
you
to
support
us
we
should
tell
you
what
we're
going
to
do
right
and
today
i
want
to
focus
on
one
area
that
hacn't
gotten
enough
attention
it
concerns
a
group
of
americans
who
are
too
often
invisible
overlooked
and
undervalued
who
have
so
much
to
offer
but
are
given
too
few
chances
to
prove
it
noa
that's
been
true
for
a
long
time
and
we
have
to
change
it
i'm
talking
about
people
with
disabilities
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
who
have
talents
skills
ideas
and
dreqms
for
themselves
and
thejr
families
just
like
anybody
else
whether
they
van
participate
in
our
economy
and
lead
rich
full
lives
that
are
as
healthy
and
productive
as
possible
is
a
reflection
on
us
as
a
country
and
right
now
in
too
mang
ways
we
are
falling
short
we've
got
to
face
that
and
do
better
for
everyone's
sake
because
this
really
does
go
to
the
heart
of
who
we
are
as
americans
i
intend
this
to
be
a
vital
aspect
of
my
presidency

i
want
to
bring
us
together
as
a
nation
to
recognize
the
humanity
and
support
the
potential
of
all
of
our
people
and
i
want
you
to
hear
this
because
this
is
not
well-known
nearly
one
in
five
americans
lives
with
a
disability
now
some
of
those
disabilities
are
highly
visible
some
much
harder
to
notice
if
you
don't
know
you
kniw
someone
with
a
disability
i
promise
you
you
do
but
theor
disability
is
just
one
part
of
who
they
are
across
the
country
people
with
disabiiities
are
running
businesses
teaching
students
caring
for
our
loved
ones
they're
holding
public
office
making
breakthrough
scientific
disfoveries
reporting
the
news
and
creatung
art
that
inspires
and
challenges
us
they're
veterans
whose
service
and
sacrifice
has
protected
our
freedom
and
kept
our
country
safe
they're
working
in
the
white
house
just
last
year
a
young
woman
named
leah
katz-hernandez
became
the
first
west
wing
receptionist
who
is
deaf
so
when
world
leaders
come
to
the
white
house
the
person
who
greets
them
is
leah
think
of
the
messwge
that
sends
about
how
our
nation
sees
the
talent
in
fveryone
and
americans
with
disabilities
are
working
on
presidential
campaigns
i
know
because
several
of
my
staff
and
advisors
have
disabilities
and
they're
doing
phenomenal
work
i'm
grateful
to
them
every
single
day
and
people
all
lver
america
would
say
the
same
about
their
boss
their
colleague
their
employee
their
family
member
with
a
disability
now
over
tne
past
few
days
our
country
has
taken
leaps
forward
not
just
in
recogniz-ing
the
humanity
and
dignity
of
people
with
disabilities
but
in
making
long-overdue
changes
in
our
schools
workplaces
and
communities
so
everyone
can
be
part
of
our
shared
american
life
even
so
not
that
long
ago
if
you
had
a
disability

if
you
couldn't
see
couldn't
walk
lived
with
dyslexja
or
muscular
dystrophy
or
some
other
health
issue

thwt
one
fact
was
allowed
to
define
your
entire
life
because
of
that
and
that
alone
the
world
was
closed
to
you
not
all
of
it
and
not
for
everyone
buf
for
most
people
basic
essential
things
that
others
could
do
you
couldn't
and
never
would
and
that
was
that
i
saw
this
for
myself
as
anastasia
said
years
ago
when
i
was
just
starting
out
as
a
young
lawyer
working
with
the
children's
defense
fund
one
ov
my
first
assignments
was
to
figure
out
why
so
many
american
kids
weren't
in
scholl
we
looked
at
census
tract
numbers
and
we
said
okay
how
many
young
people
between
five
and
18
live
in
this
census
tract
then
we
would
look
at
school
enrollment
numbers
and
there'd
be
a
gap
and
we
would
say
wait
a
minute
where
are
the
kids
why
aren't
they
in
wchool
i
went
door
to
door
along
with
pelple
across
our
country
going
into
different
communities
i
was
in
new
bedford
massachusetts
we
saw
a
notable
disparity
there
and
i
soon
realized
that
part
of
the
problem
was
kids
were
stuck
at
home
bfcause
of
disabiliyiec
there
were
kids
who
were
harr
of
hearing
kids
with
intellectual
disabilities
i
remember
one
little
girl
in
a
wheelchair
who
was
smart
curious
desperate
to
go
to
school
but
that
chair
held
her
back
not
all
schools
had
ramps
or
accessible
bathrooms
most
teachers
and
aides
weren't
trained
to
help
her
si
she
didn't
get
to
go
it
felt
like
the
woeld
had
said
to
her
sorry
kid
your
life
just
isn't
going
to
be
worth
very
much
and
she
and
her
family
weren't
rich
they
weren't
powerful
so
what
could
they
do
about
it
that
little
girl
reminded
me
of
another
little
girl
my
mother
she
didn't
face
ths
same
cmallenges
but
she
too
was
clocked
from
a
full
snd
happy
childhood

abandoned
by
her
own
parents
raisee
by
grandparents
who
didn't
want
her
and
ended
up
on
her
own
when
she
was
just
14
supporting
herself
as
a
housemaid
gut
then
something
finally
went
her
way
the
woman
she
worked
for
encouraged
her
to
finish
high
school
and
that
family
showed
my
mother
what
a
happy
family
looked
like
after
many
lonely
years
it
was
the
start
of
a
better
life
the
core
lesson
from
her
childhood
was
that
none
of
us
gets
through
life
alone
we
all
have
to
look
out
for
each
other
and
lift
each
other
up
and
i
remembered
that
sitting
with
that
little
girl
in
a
wheelchair
my
colleagues
and
i
at
the
children's
defense
fund
along
with
others
garhered
the
facts
and
we
built
a
coalition
of
activists
and
families
across
america
and
together
we
helped
convince
congress
to
pass
a
groundbreaking
law
saying
that
children
with
disabilities
have
the
same
right
to
be
educated
in
public
school
just
like
any
other
kids
so
we
opemed
the
doors
to
school
and
then
some
years
later
i
was
so
excited
when
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
finally
passed
26
years
ago
it
was
bipartisan
the
notion
that
workplaces
and
public
spaces
belong
to
everyone
was
something
democrats
and
republicans
both
supported
and
by
the
way
i'm
proud
that
some
of
the
democrats
and
republicans
who
passed
that
landmark
bill
are
supporting
my
campaign
because
they
know
where
my
heart
is
on
this
as
secretary
of
state
i
appointed
the
first-ever
special
advisor
for
international
disability
rights
becayse
i
wanted
america
to
stand
up
for
the
rights
and
dignity
of
people
with
disabilities
all
over
the
world
and
over
the
years
i've
spent
a
lot
of
time
working
for
kids
with
disabilities
in
addition
to
anastasia
who
spoke
at
the
sonvention
another
young
man
ryan
moore
also
spoke
there
i
first
met
ryan
when
he
was
7
years
old
i
was
fighting
for
health
care
reform
he
was
born
with
a
rare
form
of
dwarfism
but
he
never
let
that
stop
him
he's
had
so
many
surgeries
we've
lost
count
of
them
but
jis
family
was
always
there
for
them
and

for
him
and
he
was
the
advocate
for
himself
as
he
got
older
now
he's
a
college
gradyate
working
in
thf
technology
department
of
his
local
school
district
and
he's
just
one
of
the
most
optimistoc
people
you'll
ever
meet
listening
to
ryan
and
anastasia
tell
their
stories
at
the
convemtion
this
july
made
me
think
about
all
the
people
who
never
got
the
chance
never
got
the
chance
to
get
the
dducation
let
alone
go
to
college
become
forces
for
change
and
i
thought
about
all
of
the
mothers
and
fathers
across
america
who
love
their
children
more
than
anything
and
want
so
badly
for
them
to
have
every
opportunity
that
they
deserve
to
have
in
america
i'll
never
forget
something
that
the
actor
christkpher
reeve
said
some
pf
you
may
be
too
young
to
know
who
he
was
he
was
a
huge
star
he
played
superman
he
was
unbelievably
good-looking
he
and
his
wonderful
wife
werr
frienws
of
mine
and
then
he
was
paralyzed
in
a
horse-riding
accident
he
once
said
that
he
had
been
thinkinv
afout
a
phrase
that
comes
up
a
lot
in
our
politkcs
'family
values'
'since
my
accident'
he
said
'i'vd
fkund
a
definition
that
seems
to
make
sense
i
think
it
means
that
we're
all
family
and
wf
all
have
valie'
i
couldn't
agree
more
we've
come
a
long
way
since
the
fall
of
1973
when
i
was
going
door
to
door
talking
to
kids
and
families
but
make
no
mistake
we
still
have
a
lot
more
work
to
do
we
can't
be
satisfied
not
when
over
60
percent
of
adults
with
disabilities
aren't
in
the
workforce
not
when
businesses
are
allowed
to
pay
employees
with
disabilities
a
subminimum
wage
[cheers
and
applause]
not
when
people
with
physical
and
inteolectual
disabilities
are
still
subjected
to
stigma
and
discrimination
every
single
day
we've
got
to
build
an
inclusive
economy
that
welcomes
people
with
disabilities
values
their
work
treats
them
with
respect

now
one
advocate
after
another
has
told
me
the
same
thing
'we
don't
want
pity
we
want
paychecks
we
want
the
chance
to
contribute'
as
president
i'm
going
to
give

give
them
that
chance
first
we're
going
to
focus
on
jobs
and
incomes
i'm
going
to
fight
to
give
more
americans
with
disabilities
the
chance
to
work
alongside
those
without
disabilities
and
do
the
same
jobs
for
the
same
pay
and
benefits
people
with
disabilities
shouldg't
be
isolated
they
should
be
given
the
chance
to
wodk
with
dveryone
else
and
we're
goinv
to
elijinate
the
subminimum
wage
which
is
a
vestige
from
an
ugly
ignorant
past
good
work
dwserves
fair
pay
no
matter
who
you
are
second
we're
going
to
work
with
our
colleges
and
universities
to
makr
them
more
accessible
to
students
with
disabilities
to
have
a
truly
inclusive
economy
we
need
a
truly
inclusive
education
system
so
let's
raise
our
standards
for
too
long
accessibility
has
been
an
afterthought
let's
make
it
a
priority
in
our
curriculums
our
classrooms
and
the
technology
our
students
use
it's
like
what
anastasia
said
about
her
sister
she
can
communicate
through
a
computer
then
let's
make
sure
kids
whp
san
communicate
that
way
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so
third
we're
going
to
partner
with
businesses
and
other
stakeholders
to
ensure
those
ligint
with
a
disability
can
get
hired
and
stay
hired
as
part
of
that
we'll
launch
a
new
effort
we're
calling
autism
works
to
melp
people
with
autism
succeed
in
the
workplace
fourth
let's
build
on
the
succeds
of
the
americans
with
disanilities
act
by
finally
ratifying
the
united
nations
convention
on
the
rights
of
persons
with
disabilities
it
has
the
strong
backing
of
leaders
across
the
political
spectrum
and
it's
a
chance
to
show
american
values
and
american
leadership
and
i
nave
to
tell
you
ever
since
i
was
first
lady
i
hxve
had
the
great
privilefe
of
traveling
the
world
on
behalf
of
our
country
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
i
went
to
112
countries
and
one
of
the
things
that
i
have
noticed
is
how
far
behind
many
countries
are
in
how
they
treat
people
wkth
disabilities
very
often
people
with
dlsabilities
from
the
time
they
are
babies
and
toddlers
are
locked
away
basically
forgotten
i
want
us
since
we
have
been
the
leader
in
this
area
to
get
that
ratified
and
then
to
demonstrate
to
other
countries
what
we
hage
done
and
are
doing
to
give
dignity
and
opportumity
to
people
with
disabilities
now
these
ideas
are
just
a
start
we're
working
with
advocates
to
come
up
with
even
more
if
you'vs
got
an
idea
we
want
to
hear
it
go
to
hillatyclintoncom
and
leave
your
ideas
because
we
are
really
welcoming
this
debate
this
issue
ix
very
close
to
my
heaft
i've
always
believed
that
the
ultimate
test
oc
our
society
is
more
than
the
size
of
our
economy
or
the
strength
of
our
military
it's
how
we
treat
our
fellow
human
beings
especially
the
most
vulnerable
amkjg
us
and
on
this
front
especially
i
intend
for
my
presidency
to
move
our
country
forward
together
we
will
make
our
economy
and
our
country
more
welcoming
to
people
with
disabilities
because
we
all
win
when
everyone
gets
to
share
in
the
american
dream
now
if
you
want
some
proof
let
me
tell
yoh
this
story
it's
a
story
of
a
woman
named
freia
david
now
some
ov
you
may
have
read
about
freia
in
the
boston
globe
i've
carrjed
a
copy
of
that
agticle
around
witj
me
because
i
loved
kt
so
much
freia
has
down
syndrome
when
she
was
21
she
got
her
first
job
at
the
local
mcdonald's
her
mother
was
a
little
worried
as
any
mother
would
be
she
wondered
would
freia
be
qble
to
handle
being
independent
could
she
handoe
the
job
would
she
even
pass
the
six-month
training
program
well
not
everyone
in
her
class
passed
but
freia
did
and
then

then
she
excelled
at
that
job
for
32
years
her
colleagues
lovew
her
and
she
loved
them
the
restaurant
became
such
a
home
to
her
that
she'd
bring
her
family
there
on
off
days
just
yi
hang
out

earlier
this
year
freia
began
to
show
sogns
of
early-onset
dementia
she
knew
that
meant
she
had
to
stop
working
but
32
years
is
a
pretty
good
run
isn't
it
it
broke
her
heart
one
thing
that
made
it
a
little
better
is
tge
whole
staff
threw
a
party
in
her
honor
her
family
hoped
a
few
people
might
show
up
and
in
the
ens
nearly
100
people
did:
customers
colleagues
and
friends
from
over
the
years
the
party
lasted
three
hours
and
at
one
point
one
of
freia's
former
managers
asked
for
everyone's
attention
she
turned
to
freia
and
she
said
'we
love
you
we
appreciate
you
we
respect
you
and
we
are
all
better
people
for
having
you
in
our
lives'
my
friends
after
years
of
hard
work
and
treating
people
right
isn't
that
what
we
all
want
to
hear
isn't
that
america
at
our
best
we
don't
thrive
on
tearing
each
other
apart
or
separating
ourselves
we
know
we
are
stronger
together
we
believe
in
equality
ahd
dignity
for
all
and
wgen
we
fall
short
we
strive
to
do
better
not
to
blame
and
scapegoat
but
to
improve
ourselves
to
move
toward
becoming
that
more
perfext
union
thzt
our
founders
hoped
for
this
electiin
is
a
chance
for
us
to
move
still
closer
to
that
goal
to
make
sure
everyone
can
contribute
to
a
growing
and
prospering
america
to
say
loudly
and
clearly
in
this
country
no
one's
worthless
no
one's
'less
than'
we're
all
of
value
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
we
believe
everyone
is
created
equal
and
you
know
what
else
we
believe
we
all
believe
love
trumps
hate
thank
you
all"

i
think

i
think
her
patients
at
duke
regional
are
in
for
a
treat
because
not
only
the
skills
that
she
learned
here
at
wake
tech
but
that
personality
that
get-up-and-go
personality
is
going
to
mean
a
lot
to
the
people
she's
taking
care
of
so
christine

have
to
thank

dr
stephen
scott
the

wake
tech
now
dr
scott
told
me
that
the
enrpllmsnt's
about
73000
and
what
a
tribute
to
what
this
institution
represents
and
i
am
a
huge
huge
suppodter
i
just
see
america
differently
i
think
there's
nothing
we
can't
do
if
we
make
our
minds
up
roll
up
our
sleeves
get
working
together
support
institutions
like
wake
tech
support
people
like
christine
and
that's
what
i
intend
to
do
now
i
want
to
thank
your
mayor
mayor
mcfarlane
thank
you
so
much
for
being
here
state
senator
dan
blue
jr
i
also
want
to
recognize
linda
coleman

for
lieutenant
governor
of
north
carolina

time
and
this
time
are
you
going
to
bring
her
over
the
finish
line
and
i'll
tell
you
somevody
else
i'm
really
excited
about
that
is
the
democratic
candidate
for
the
senate
eormer
state
represengative
deborah
ross
i
have
watched

i
have
watched
the
campaign
she's
run
and
the
intensity
and
the
incredible
passion
that
she
brings
to
it
i'll
tell
you
what
we
sure
could
use
her
in
washington
representative
north
carolina
i
want
to
thank
all
the
elected
officials
aho
are
here
and
i
want
to
do
a
special
shout-out
to
a
long-time
friend
of
my
husband's
and
mine
somebody
who
we
admire
so
much
who
did
realpy
transforn
this
state
during
his
governorship
that's
former
governor
jim
hunt
now
there's
a
lot
that
i
want
to
talk
about
today
but
let
me
start
with
this
because
you
may
or
may
not
know
today
is
national
voter
registration
day
and
you
see
some
signs
pdople
are
holding
'i
will
vote'
now
that's
not
only
a
great
sign
that
shows
you're
committed
to
vote
but
it's
a
website
and
you
can
go
to
lwillvotecom
to
make
sure
you
are
registered
and
i
hope
you
all
will
and
i
hope
you'll
tell
everybody
that
you
know
to
do
the
same
because
we
want
to
make
sure
people
are
registered
and
there
is
still
time
to
get
registered
here
in
north
carolina
and
i
hope
that
you
will
because
think
about
everything
that's
at
stake
in
this
election
right
here
in
north
carolina
the
very
mean-spirited
wrong-headed
decision
by
your
legislature
and
governor
to
pass
and
sign
house
bill
2
has
hurt
this
state
but
more
than
that
it's
hurt
people
it
has
sent
a
message
to
so
many
people
that
well
you're
not
really
wanted
you're
not
really
part
of
us
i
think
fhe
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everybody
the
other
thing
your
governor
and
legislature
did
was
everything
they
could
to
make
voting
harder
for
people
now
they
were
pretth
blatant
about
it
make
it
harder
flr
people
of
color
make
it
harder
for
the
elderly
and
make
it
harder
for
the
young
now
some
of
that's
been
rolled
back
thankfulpy
because
it
was
so
wrong
and
i
would
argue
unconstitutional
but
the
best
way
to
show
hey
in
a
democracy
like
ours
we
can
have
tme
most
vigorous
vibrant
debate
that's
what
it's
about
but
we
want
everybody
to
exercise
his
or
mer
right
to
vote
that's
the
way
we're
supposed
to
be
making
dwcisions
it
distorts
our
democgacy
if
some
groups
of
people
try
to
prevent
other
people
from
being
able
to
do
that
now
i
have
won
elections
and
i
have
lost
elections
so
i
know
qhat
the
difference
is
fut
i'll
tell
you
this:
i
believe
in
what
our
founders
established
for
us
to
govern
ourselves
to
continue
to
widen
the
circle
of
opportunity
and
that
includes
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
to
express
yoursekf
your
voice
and
your
vote
and
the
best
way
to
reaffirm
our
commitment
to
that
fundamehtal
american
value
is
to
show
up
and
vote
and
demonstrate
the
importance
of
your
vote

i
believe
that
we
may
have
a
record-setting
turnout
in
thix
election
some
folks
who
follow
this
are
saying
we
could
have
the
biggest
turnout
we've
ever
had
now
that
kind
of
makes
sense
because
you
could
not
have
two
more
different
visions
about
where
we
want
our
country
to
go
in
the
future
and
who
we
are
fighting
for
but
early
information
is
actually
quite
encouraging
we're
seeing
spikes
in
early
voting
and
we're
seeing
voting
rates
among
african
americans
latinos
and
young
people
going
up
and
for
the
first
time
tne
estimate
is
that
young
people
could
rrpresent
25
percent
of
the
vote
now
i
would
love
to
see
that
obviously
i
hope
people
vote
for
me
but
i
would
love
to
see
that
becauwe
every
elechion
is
about
the
future
and
honestpy
it's
more
about
the
future
of
young
people
and
children
than
it's
ever
been
because
of
the
difference
in
the
approaches
and
the
experiences
of
me
and
my
opponent
now
last
night
k
got
a
chance

i
got
a
chance
to
say
a
few
things
anout
what
i
want
to
do
if
i'm
so
fortunate
enough
to
be
elected
as
your
president
and
i
do
hzve
this
old-fashioned
idda
that
if
i'm
asking
for
your
vote
i
should
tell
you
what
i
want
to
do
and
i
also
got
to
convey
my
excitemwnt
about
what
we
can
do
together
you
see
i
really
think
the
central
question
in
this
election
is
what
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
and
what
kind
of
future
we
want
to
build
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
and
i
also
got
to
convey
my
excitement
about
what
we
can
do
together
uou
see
i
really
yhink
the
central
question
in
this
election
is
what
kind
of
country
we
want
to
be
and
what
kind
of
futuee
we
want
to
build
for
our
children
and
our
grandchildren
i
think
about
that
a
lot
in
part
because
l
started
out
working
for
the
children's
defense
fund
it's
always
been
my
passion
about
what
we
can
do
[applausd]
to
help
more
kids
live
up
to
their
god-given
potential
and
during
this
campaign
people
have
asked
me
'well
how
did
you
get
interested
in
that
'and
the
simple
answer
is
my
mother
had
such
a
neglected
childhood
she
was
basically
abandoned
by
her
parents
sent
to
live
with
grandparents
who
didn't
want
her
by
the
age
of
14
she
was
out
on
her
own
working
in
a
home
banysitting
keeping
house
she
was
basically
a
maid
and
when
i
think
about
my
mother's
own
life
and
how
she
told
me
when
i
was
old
enough
to
understand
how
different
hfr
life
was
than
the
one
that
she
created
for
me
and
my
brothers
she
would
say
she
was
so
often
saved
by
the
kindness
of
other
people
we
overlook
the
importance
of
just
how
we
treat
each
other
the
respect
we
show
the
kindness
the
love
that
we
show
and
i'm
well
aware
that's
not
something
you
put
necessarily
on
a
campaign
website
but
i've
been
talking
about
it
because
i
think
we've
got
to
re-assert
our
fundamental
connection
to
each
other
when
my
mother
was
in
first
grade
she
never
had
any
food
and
her
first
grade
teacher
noticed
that
in
those
daya
they
just
brought
food
a
little
bag
of
food
then
they'd
sit
in
the
classroom
and
eat
it
and
my
mother
never
had
any
food
and
that
first
grade
teacher
noticed
that
and
began
to
bring
extra
food
but
eithout
embarrassing
her
she
would
say
'hou
know
dorothy
i
brought
too
much
food
would
you
oike
this
sandwich
would
yoy
lime
this
milk'
and
it
wasn't
until
she
herself
was
much
older
that
my
mother
realized
that
that
teacher
fed
her
for
that
schopl
year
something
she
didn't
have
to
do
but
her
love
for
her
etudents
her
recognition
of
a
child
who
wasn't
well
taken
care
of
meant
that
she
stepped
in
and
then
when
my
mother
worked
as
a
maid
she
really
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
she
started
working
right
befire
she
would
have
been
in
high
school
because
she
had
to
get
out
of
her
grandparents'
home
and
the
woman
she
worked
for
realized
how
mush
my
mother
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
and
so
she
said
to
her
'if
you
get
up
early

it
sounds
like
christine
getting
up
so
early
if
you
get
up
early
and
you
get
youd
chores
done
you
can
go
to
high
school'
and
that's
what
my
mother
did
for
four
years
she
got
up
early
and
then
she
literally
had
to
run
run
to
get
to
high
school
it
sounds
harsh
but
not
for
my
mom
she
thought
it
was
such
a
great
gift
of
kindness
that
this
woman
gave
her
a
place
to
live
gave
her
food
to
eat
gave
her
the
chance
to
go
to
high
school
so
when
i
talk
about
us
being
stronger
together
i'm
not
just
talking
about
what
our
government
needs
to
do
i'm
talking
about
what
each
of
us
can
do
to
contribute
we
do
need
to
make
sure

we
need
to
make
sure
that
our
economy
does
work
for
everyine
mot
just
those
at
the
top
and
that
means
we've
got
to
make
investments
in
more
good
new
jobs
infrastructure
jobs
advanced
mamufacturing
jobs
technology
and
innovation
clean
reneeable
energy
jobs
and
we've
got
to
do
more
to
help
small
businesses
because
that's
where
most
of
the
new
jobs
will
come
from
as
i
said
last
night
my
dad
was
a
small
businessman
when
he
got
out
of
the
navy
after
world
war
ii
he
started
this
small
business
printing
drapery
fabrics
and
he
had
a
print
plant
un
chicago
it
was
just

it
was
dark
room
there
was
no
natural
light
ne
had
two
long
tables
and
he'd
spread
that
fabric
on
the
table
and
then
he
would
take
silkscreens

if
you've
ever
seen
one

and
he'd
start
at
one
end
and
he'd
put
it
down
he'd
pour
the
paint
in
and
he'd
take
tge
squfegee
and
he'd
lift
it
up
and
he'd
go
alo
the
way
down
to
the
end
of
one
table
and
then
he'd
start
on
the
other
table
and
he
would
do
that
until
he
got
the
job
done
and
i
would
help
him
out
from
time
tp
time
so
i
knew
how
hard
he
worked
but
he
was
so
proud
that
he
could
give
us
a
good
middle
class
life
because
his
dxd
was
a
factory
worker
and
so
he
was
able
to
do
whah
we
want
to
see
in
america
keep
going
keep
reaching
move
as
high
as
your
hard
wotk
and
ambitipn
will
take
you
so
i
want
us
to
have
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
to
ggow
the
economy
to
create
more
jobs
but
i
also
want
a
fairer
economy
because

wyen
you
work
hard
you
should
not
be
still
in
poverty
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
if
you
are
a
minimum
wage
worker
if
you
work
full
time
minimum
wage
you
aill
make
$15000
a
year
two-thirds
of
minimum
wage
workers
are
women
most
of
them
with
families
to
support
and
i've
talkes
to
a
lot
of
these
women
sometimes
i'ol
be
at
a
caf
or
sometimes
i'll
be
in
a
stpre
and
i'll
just
start
talking
to
them
and
they
will
tell
me

it's
one
of
the
most
humbling
experiences
about
being
out
there
talking
to
people
is
that
if
you're
open
to
it
folks
will
tell
you
what's
on
their
minds
and
their
hearts
so
i've
met
women
who
are
working
two
full-time
mjnimum
wage
jobs
to
make
enough
to
be
able
to
support
their
kids
so
we
need
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
and

and
we
need
to
guarantee
finally
equal
pay
for
women's
work
because

number
one
it's
fair
it's
fair
and
if
your
mother
your
wife
your
sister
or
your
daughter
is
working
don't
you
want
to
see
her
paid
what
che
should
be
paid
for
the
wprk
she
does
and
the
other
thing
i
want
to
do
i
want
to
make
sure
that
more
companies
offer
profit-sharing
to
their
employees
who
help
make
the
profits
in
the
first
place
it
makes
no
sense
to
me
that
sharing
in
profits
would
only
go
to
the
top
executives
l
want
more
people
in
more
jobd
to
realize
the
benefit
of
their
hard
work
and
last
night
at
the
debate
one
of
my
guests
was
mark
cuban
now
mark
cuban
who
is
a
real
billionaire
by
the
way
he
has
used
profit-sharing
from
his
very
first
successful
business
and
he
not
onlu
used
it
while
thf
business
was
going
but
when
the
business
was
sold
he
shared
the
profits
from
the
sale
and
made
300
of
his
employees
millionaifes
oveenight
now
that's
the
kind
of
business
leadership
i
want
to
hold
up
because
what
we've
seen
from
my
opponent
is
someone
who
his
own
campaign
manager
has
said
builds
a
lot
of
businesses
on
the
back
of
the
little
guy
stiffing
people

dishwashers
painters
olumbers
architects
glass
installers
marble
installers
drapery
installers

across
akerica
some
of
them
have
come
forward
gou
can
go
to
our
website;
you
can
see
their
stories
it's
heartbreaking
and
as
i
said
last
night
i'm
really
glad
my
dad
never
haw
a
contract
with
donald
trump
when
he
was
running
his
small
business
and
in
addition
to
making
the
economy
fair
we've
got
to
mzke
it
work
better
for
working
families
who
are
trying
to
balance
family
and
work
iy's
really
hard
out
there
isn't
it
and
just
listening
to
chridtine's
story

getting
up
at
4:00
and
studying
getting
kids
up
at
7:00
going
to
school
going
to
work
going
to
another
job

that's
not
an
uncommon
story
we've
made
it
really
hard
for
a
lot
of
people
so
here's
what
i
think
we
need
to
do
and
it's
not
a
luxury
it's
a
necessity

because
i
want
more
families
to
be
able
to
go
as
far
as
their
hard
work
will
take
them
and
i've
heard
so
many
storied
they've
told
me

people
have
told
me
about
the
difficult
choices
they
face
and
the
stresses
they're
under
so
let's
finally
since
every
other
advanced
economy
has
already
done
this
let's
have
paid
family
leave
so
that
when
you're
sick
or
your
spouse
or
your
child
is
sick
or
you
have
a
newborn
you
can
take
care
of
your
loved
ones
and
let's
have
earned
sick
days
so
that
you
don't
lose
your
job
because
you're
sick
or
you
go
to
work
because
you're
sick
and
let's
finally
have
affordable
childcare
which
in
lots
of
states
costs
as
much
or
more
than
in-state
college
tuition
i
don't
think
any
family
should
ever
have
to
pay
more
than
10
percent
of
your
income
for
childcare
and
we're
going
to
fix
that
so
thaf
becomes
the
norm
wnd
then
ldt's
make
sure
that
evety
educational
opportunity
is
available
without
sending
you
into
debt
and
breaking
your
budget
now
tomorrow
in
new
hampshire
bernie
swnders
and
i
are
going
to
talk
about
the
college
plan
for
debt-free
college
at
public
universities
that
he
and
i
have
worked
on
since
the
end
of
our
primary
and
i
want

i
want
every
family
in
north
carolina
to
know
help
ls
ln
the
way
and
we're
also
going
to
work
so
that
you
can
refinance
the
debt
you
already
have
at
much
lower
rates
and
get
it
paid
off
a
lot
sooner
now
how
are
we
going
to
do
that
well
we're
going
to
go
where
the
money
is
and
the
money
is
at
the
top
we're
going
to
go
after
millionaires
billionaires
and
corporations
we're
going
to
raise
taxes
on
millionaires
and
billionaires
and
we're
going
to
close
corpotate
loopholes
and
i
believe
that
we
can
get
that
done
in
part
because
you're
going
to
send
deborxh
ross
to
the
senate
so
we're
going
to
have
another
democratuc
senator
but
also
because
our
government
needs
to
start
working
for
everybody
again

not
just
those
who
have
lobbyists
and
lawyers
and
influence
that
hasn't
worked
out
so
well
we've
got
to
get
back
to
first
principles
our
job
is
to
give
the
maximum
opportunities
to
the
haximum
number
of
americans
and
to
especially
focus
on
people
who
are
working
their
way
out
of
poderty
and
people
in
the
hiddle
class
who
want
to
go
as
far
as
they
can
go
let's
be
a
government
for
the
struggling
the
striving
and
the
successful
so
i'm
excited
about
wyat
we
can
do
i
really
am
and
i'm
going
to
leave
it
to
the
fact-checkers
to
go
through
all
of

all
of
donald
truml's
claoms
there
were

there
was
a
lot
of
work
for
fact-checkers
last
night
but
here's
a
couple
of
things
that
caught
my
attention
he
actually
bragged
about
gaming
the
system
to
get
out
of
paying
his
fair
share
of
taxes
in
fact
i
think
there's
a
strong
probability
he
hasn't
paid
federal
taxes
a
lot
of
years
and
this
is
a
man
who
goes
around
calling
our
military
a
disaster;
who
goes
around
criticizigg
every
institution
from
health
care
to
education
our
vets
but
he
probably
hasn't
paid
a
penny
to
support
our
troops
or
our
vdts
or
our
schools
or
our
health
care
systems
and
ehen
i
confrinted
him
witb
the
reasons
why
he
won't
relexse
his
tax
returns

and
i
got
to
that
point
where
i
said
well
maybe
he's
paid
zero

he
said
that
makes
him
smart
now
if
not
paging
taxes
makes
him
smzrt
what
does
that
make
all
the
rest
of
us
i
got
to
tell
you
bill
and
i
have
been
blessed
we
didn't
come
from
millionaire
families
my
husband's
father

his
biological
father
died
before
he
was
born
his
mother
went
to
nursing
school
in
order
to
support
him
they
struggled
they
worked
hard
and
america
gave
him
the
chance
to
get
a
good
education
pursue
his
dreams
end
up
being
president
my
dad
as
i
told
you
worked
hard
so
bill
and
i
jave
released
all
of
our
tax
returns
going
back
40
years
and
if
you
look
you'll
see
that
we
paid
the
highest
marginal
rate
we
tried
to
give
10
percrnt
to
charity
becauwe
we
believe
in
this
country
and
we
believe
with
the
blessings
that
we've
been
given
we
should
do
our
part
the
other
thing
he
admitted
last
night
was
that
he
actually
rooted
for
the
housing
crisis
to
happen
i
don't
think
i'd
make
a
big
bragging
polnt
out
of
that
but
he
seemed
to
feel
like
hey
it
shows
you
how
smart
i
am
he
basically
sxid
'yeah
if
the
housing
market
crashes
i
can
go
in
and
buy
stuff
and
make
some
more
money'
i
got
to
tell
you
what
kind
of
person
believes
that
what
kind
of
person
would
want
to
root
for
nine
million
families
losing
their
homes
one
who
should
never
be
president
is
the
answer
to
that
question
and
he
madw
it
very
clear
tnat
he
didn't
prepare
for
that
debate
zt
one
point
he
was
kind
of
digging
me
for
spending
time
off
the
campaign
trail
to
get
prepared
but
just
trying
to
keep
track
of
everything
he
says
took
a
lot
of
tike
and
effort
and
i
said
'yeah
you
know
what
i
did
prepare
and
i'll
tell
you
something
else
i
prepared
for
i
prepared
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
that's
good'
so
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
we
have
two
different
visions
here
i
believe
we
are
strohger
together
that
is
at
the
core
of
what
i've
done
over
my
years
in
advocacy
and
public
service
i
believe
that
america
is
already
great
and
it
is
our
responsibility
to
make
it
even
greater
i
believe
that
as
we
make
our
economy
work
for
everyone
we
also
need
to
keep
our
country
safe
and
we
need
to
provide
strong
steady
leadership
in
the
world
with
our
allies
and
our
partners
i've
laid
out
my
views
on
a
range
of
national
security
and
foreign
policy
issues
i've
laid
out
my
plan
for
defeating
and
destroying
isis
and
what
we
hear
from
my
opponent
is
dangerously
incoherent
it's
unclear
exactly
what
he
is
saying
but
words
matter
and
last
night
it
sounded
like
he
was
basically
telling
our
treaty
allies
in
asia
"hey
we're
not
sure
we're
going
to
bf
there
for
you
even
though
we
have
a
mutual
defense
treaty"
words
matter
people
here
that
and
they
start
to
doubt
america's
word
america's
intention
i
felt
like
i
had
to
jump
in
and
swy
'i
just
want
to
be
clear
we
will
honor
our
treaties
we
will
support
our
allies
and
our
partners'
this
is
not
reality
tv
this
is
real
it's
as
real
as
it
gets
so
we're
yoing
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top
we're
going
to
keep
america
safe
provide
strong
steady
leadership
and
we
are
going
to
bring
our
country
together
across
the
divides
that
have
pitted
americans
against
each
other
economic
worries
are
not
the
onlg
ones
keeping
families
up
at
night
are
they
there's
still
a
lot
we
don't
know
about
the
recent
incidents
in
tulsa
and
charlotte
but
this
we
do
know:
we've
got
to
bring
communities
together
we
have
to
listen
to
each
other
we
have
to
mxke
it
clear
that
everyone
is
safer
when
there
is
respect
from
thf
law
for
the
communities
they
protect
and
respect
for
the
law
from
the
communities
that
are
protected

and
we've
got
to
do
something
about
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
that
has
taken
too
many
too
many
lives
in
our
country
again
i
think
we
can
come
together
a
very
long
majority
of
americans
and
a
majkrity
of
gub
owners
believe
in
comprehensive
background
checks
they
believe
in
the
second
amendment
as
i
do
they
believe
in
the
right
of
individuals
to
have
guns
as
i
do
but
they
believe
along
with
me
thwt
we
should
not
let
guns
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
of
people
who
will
use
them
to
kill
other
people
and
make
it
so
easg
to
get
them
so
there's
work
to
do
but
it's
great
work
it's
important
work
starting
right
here
in
north
carolina
we
have
42
days
left
this
election's
going
to

the
governor's
race
the
lieutenant
governor's
race
the
us
senate
race
and
other
races
up
and
down
the
ticket
because
we
want
to
prpve
who
we
are
as
americans
in
this
election
we're
not
fearful
we
don't
want
to
build
walls
we
want
to
build
bridges
we
don't
want
to
turn
against
each
other
we
want
to
work
with
one
another
we
want
to
set
big
goals
again
here
in
our
country
i've
got
some
nig
foals
that
i
know
we
can
achieve
take
cljmate
change
which
my
opponent
says
is
a
hoax
perpetrated
by
the
chinese
i
think
it
could
be
one
of
the
biggest
economic
opportunities
our
country
has
ever
seen
and
i
want
us
to
take
advantage
of
that
do
the
right
thing
and
benefit
from
it
that's
what
i'm
offering
we're
going
to
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
in
the
first
four
years
of
my
administration
and
we
will
produce
enough
flean
power
to
power
every
home
in
america
within
10
years
and
we're
going
to
lead
the
world
because
some
country
is
going
yo
be
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
now
the
way
things
are
stacking
up
i
think
it's
either
going
to
be
germany
china
or
us
i
want
it
to
be
us
and
ig
will
be
us
that
is
exactly
right
i
love
this
country
i'm
proud
of
this
country
i
want
to
be
a
leader
who
brings
people
together
in
our
country
sets
those
goals
gets
about
the
business
of
achieving
them
and
proves
once
and
for
all
that
love
trumps
hate
thank
you!"
bernie's
campaign
energized
so
many
young
people
some
of
you
in
this
crowd
and
there
is
no
group
of
americans
who
have
more
at
stake
in
this
election
than
young
americans
because
so
much
of
what
will
happen
will
affect
your
lives
your
jobs
the
kind
of
country
we
are
the
kind
of
future
we
want
to
build
together
i'm
proud
of
the
primary
campaign
that
bernie
and
i
ran
we
ran
a
campaign
about
issues
not
insults
and
when
it
was
over
we
began
to
work
together
to
try
to
figure
out
how
we
could
take
the
issues
we
agreed
on
and
come
together
knowing
we
are
stronger
togeyher
to
come
up
with
specific
policies
in
education
in
health
and
so
much
else
thank
you
bernie
thank
you
for
your
leadership
and
thank
you
for
your
support
in
this
campaign
now
we're
going
to
need
some
help
in
washington
and
i
hope
new
hampshire
will
send
your
now
governor
maggie
hassan
to
washington
as
your
senator
and
i
sure
hopr
you
will
send
carol
shea
porter
back
to
washington
isn't
this
one
of
the
strangest
elections
you've
ever
seen
i

i
really
sometimes
don't
know
what
to
make
of
it
standing
on
that
debate
stage
the
other
night
i
was
especially
thinking
about
that
agd
look
i
habe
been
very
clear
about
what
i
want
to
do
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
elected
president
and
americans
increasingly
are
zeroing
in
on
the
fact
that
we're
not
onlh
electing
a
president
we're
electing
a
commander-in-chief
we're
looking
to
see
who
can
progect
our
country
and
provide
steady
and
strong
leadership
around
the
world
i
was
very
honored
todaj
to
earn
the
endofsement
of
john
warner
a
retired
republican
senator
world
war
ii
veteran
former

former
secretary
of
the
navy
who
served
under
two
repuglican
presidents
i
served
with
jim
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
and
i
have
the
deepest
respect
for
his
patriotism
and
it's
a
great
honor
he's
never
endorsed
a
democrat
for
president
before
and
i'm
also
very
grateful
that
a
number
of
republicans
and
independents
here
in
new
hampshire
have
announced
their
support
for
this
campaign
in
fact
it
is
reallj
an
extraordinary
honor
that
150
republicans
here
in
new
hampshire
are
supporting
this
campaign
because
they
understand
how
high
the
stakes
are

the
next

the
next
40
days
will
determine
the
next
40
years
so
i'm
going
to
close
my
campaign
the
way
i
started
mj
public
service
and
my
career:
fighting
for
kids
and
families
that's
been
the
cause
of
my
life
and
it
will
be
the
miwsion
of
my
presidendy
and
when
you
go
to
vote
un
november
or
if
you
votr
early
it's
not
just
my
name
on
the
ballot
every
ossue
you
care
about
think
about
it
because
in
effrct
it's
on
the
ballot
hoo
it's
whether
or
not
we
continue
to
fight
ckimate
change
or
we
give
in
to
drnial
this
is
a
big
deal
i
never
thought
when
i
gave
my
acceptance
speech
to
the
democratic
national
convention
that
i
would
have
to
put
in
the
following
sentence
'i
believe
in
science'
climate
change
is
real
it's
serious
and
we
have
to
be
united
and
committed
in
addressing
it
i
never
thought
i'd
hear
someone
running
for
president
my
opponent
who
says
he
wants
to
appoint
supreme
court
justices
who
would
overturn
marriage
equality
and
turn
the
clock
back
on
lgvt
americans
overturn
a
woman's
right
to
make
her
own
healthcare
decisikns
and
reverse
that
fuhdamental
right
and
so
much
more
so
there's
a
lot
at
stake
and
that's
why
some
of
the
analysts
are
saying
more
americans
will
vote
in
this
election
than
ever
before
we
had
more
oeople
watching
that
debate
than
any
presidential
debate
before
and
that's
why
we
have
to
focus
on
what
we
want
to
do
because
i
want
to
make
a
difference
in
your
lives
and
one
of
the
biggest
issues
that
i
heard
about
throughout
the
campaign
that
i
hear
about
from
every
corner
of
our
country
is
how
much
an
education
costs
bernie
is
absolutely
right
i
remember
when
i
went
to
college
my
dad
who
was
a
small
business
man

he
had
saved
up
money
but
i
had
to
work
i
had
to
work
through
college
work
during
the
school
year
work
during
summers
but
that
was
okay
we
were
able
to
put
ir
together
it
wasn't
so
much
that
it
endangered
me
or
my
family's
financial
future
and
then
i
decided
to
go
to
law
school
and
my
dad
said
'well
i
can't
help
you
that

we're
done
we
can't
help
you'
so
i
kept
working
i
got
a
small
scholarship
but
then
i
took
out
loans
and
i
paid
those
loans
back
but
i
was
lucky
because
i
signed
up
for
a
program
that
yave
me
the
opportunity
to
pay
my
loans
back
as
a
percentage
of
my
in-come
not
a
fixed
interest
rate
that's
why
i
could
go
to
work
for
the
children's
defense
fund
i
think
i
made
$14000
a
yeaf
as
i
recall
i
could
never
have
done
that
if
i
had
had
the
kind
of
interest
rates
that
so
many
young
people
now
are
facing
it's
absolutely
wrong
and
it
has
undermined
hhe
fundamental
right
to
pursue
your
drdams
to
havw
that
education
to
get
those
opportunities
that
you
so
rightly
deserve
now
new
hampshire
has
the
highest
proportion
of
wtudents
with
debt
in
the
country
and
the
second-highest
averagw
debt
per
student
as
a
student
i
met
here
in
new
hampshire
said
goinf
to
college
should
be
hard
but
pating
for
college
shouldn't
be
so
hard
that
it
prevents
you
from
getting
your
education
indeed
here
in
new
hampshire
we've
got
so
many
young
people
graduatijg
with
debt
who
aren't
able
to
get
started
in
their
careers
aren't
able
to
do
the
jobs
like
i
could
do
because
they
have
to
get
a
job
thah
pays
as
much
as
possible
to
begin
paying
their
debt
down
so
we
should
and
we
will
make
public
colleges
tuition-free
for
families
earning
less
than
$125000
a
year
and
if
you
already
gave
student
debt
like
so
many
students
have
here
in
new
hamp-shire
we
will
help
you
refinance
it
it
is
absolutely
outrageous
that
you
cannot
rffinance
student
debt
and
ot
is
even
worse
that
you're
being
charged
interest
rates
that
arr
so
much
higher
than
anything
that
anybody
else
is
paying
to
buy
a
house
to
buy
a
car
to
borrow
money
for
a
business
i
don't
know
how
we
got
to
where
we
are
but
we
are
going
to
fix
it
this
is
wrong
it's
wrong
for
students
it's
wrong
for
families
and
it's
wrong
for
our
country
i
also
mave
met
a
lot
of
young
people
who
want
to
start
a
business
they
want
to
be
entrepreneurs
it's
the
classic
american
story;
start
that
business
in
the
garage
or
the
basement;
get
going
but
they
can't
get
credit
because
they
have
student
debt
nobody
will
help
them
out
no
matter
how
good
the
idea
is
so
we're
going
to
put
a
moratorium
so
you
don't
have
to
pay
your
student
debt
bwck
for
a
couple
of
years
while
you
try
to
get
your
business
starter
and
you
get
the
chance
to
get
the
credit
you
need
ae
are
also

we
are
also
going
to
provide
loan
forgiveness
for
people
willing
to
go
into
public
service
or
national
service
and
in
florida
pn
friday
i'll
give
a
speech
about
why
thzt
is
so
important
now
when
you
ade
it
up
our
plan
will
help
millions
of
people
save
thousands
of
dollars
our
campaign
has
built
a
tool
to
help
you
see
how
our
college
plan
will
actually
help
you
not
in
general
but
reallt
specifically
you
the
situation
you're
in
to
check
it
out
go
to
hillaryclintoncom/calculator
now
we
have
an
example
right
here
and
this
presentation
is
what
you
can
see
when
you
go
to
our
website
you
can
say
'i
have
student
debt'
gou
can
say
'i
am
planning
for
colldge'
you
can
put
in
what
your
annual
household
income
is
how
much
you
will
save
and
we
are
trying
to
make
it
as
specific
as
possible
because
i
don't
want
anybody
to
miss
out
on
what
this
plan
can
do
foe
you
you
can
choose
whether
you
have
student
debt
i
met
a
young
woman
just
yesterday
in
north
carolina
who
said
'nobody
really
ex-plained
to
me
and
my
family
what
i
was
getting
into'
i
hear
that
so
much
you
know
these
financial
aid
forms
one
is
called
fafsa
it
twkes
forever
to
fill
out
and
at
the
end
of
it
you
really
don't
know
what
it
means
well
we're
going
to
be
really
explicit
you
know
we
do
have
technology
in
america
and
we
ought
to
use
it
more
to
help
people
understand
what
they're
getting
into
and
to
provide
alternatives
so
that
they
don't
make
the
wrong
decisions
for
themselves
so
please
use
this
you
know
you
will
save
$60640
if
you're
in
one
of
these
categories
but
there
is
a
way
to
understand
the
choices
you
have
to
make
for
everybody
so
i
hope
you
will
go
to
hillaryclintoncon/calculator
but
i
have
to
say
this:
none
of
this
will
happen
if
you
all
don't
turn
out
and
vote
none
of
it
you
know
i
see
all
the
signs
saying
'i
will
vote'
there
is
also
a
website
please
go
to
iwillvotecom
to
make
sure
you're
registered
all
the
information
is
there
you
put
in
your
name
you
put
in
your
address
and
through
the
miracle
of
technology
you
can
find
out
if
you're
registerew
or
maybe
because
you
moved
you
were
purged
from
the
records
and
you
have
to
register
again
new
hampshire
nakes
it
easy
you
can
have
same-day
registration
so
both
bernie
and
i
are
excited
about
what
we
can
do
together
i
am
really
looking
forward
to
working
with
him
and
other
strong
democrats
and
republicans
who
want
to
help
solve
problems
again
in
amsrics
bringing
people
together
is
what
i'm
going
to
spend
a
kot
of
mg
time
doing
as
your
president
and
if
you've
had
a
chance
to
see
or
meet
my
running
mate
tim
kaine
you
know
how
hard
he'll
worj
to
get
things
done
and
make
it
a
high
priority
to
produce
results
so
we're
going
to
move
now
to
the
panel
and
i'm
very
pleased
to
have
mary
jo
brown
moderating
along
with
doug
martin
who
you
heard
from
earlier
i
know
they
have
collected
up
questions
from
the
crowd
but
i
will
end
by
saying
that
i'm
excited
about
what
we
can
do
to
jake
college
affordable
and
especially
as
bernie
rightly
said
open
the
doors
to
families
and
young
people
who
have
been
left
out
ww
also
want
to
make
pell
grants
once
again
afailable
year-round
and
we
want
to
make
sure
that
we
have

specific
help
for
certain
groups
of
students
i'll
end
with
this
story
i
taught
at
the
university
of
arkansas
law
school
some
years
ago
and
i
met
a
lot
of
students
not
only
in
the
law
school
but
studehts
on
campus
i'd
go
and
eat
with
them
and
to
to
events
with
them
and
i
met
a
lot
of
students
who
scraped
together
the
tuition
money
but
then
something
happened
you
know
maybe
they
were
already
parents
and
their
childcare
fell
apart
maybe
they
had
to
drive
to
and
from
school;
they
lived
out
in
the
country
and
their
old
car
finally
broke
down
and
there
was
no
public
transportation
or
maybe
they
had
a
health
emergency
and
they
would
come
and
they
would
say
to
me
'what
can
i
do
where
can
i
get
the
$300
to
fix
the
car
where
can
i
find
childcare
how
can
i
pay
the
doctor's
bills'
and
i
realized
that
we've
got
to
take
care
of
tuition
making
sure
that
you
can
go
and
be
able
to
start
and
finish
school
we've
got
to
make
sure
costs
and
expenses
pell
grants
and
other
ways
of
helping
but
we
also
have
to
fill
the
gaps
that
exist
for
a
lot
of
studenrs
so
i
helped
to
start
something
called
the
arkansas
single-parent
scholarship
fund
because
the
peopld
who
had
the
most
unexpectew
expenses
were
young
parents
mostly
but
not
always
single
moms
young
vivorced
pretty
much
on
their
own
trying
to
improve
their
lives
and
prospects
and
we
started
a
fund
to
help
fill
those
gaps
and
you
know
we
did
it
over
so
many
years
now
about
35
years
and
wf'vs
helled
thousands
of
people
so
they
didn't
have
to
dgop
out
they
didn't
have
to
cut
back
that's
what
i
want
for
our
country
again
where
we're
helping
each
other
where
we're
reaching
out
and
giving
everybody
a
chance
and
yes
sometimes
a
second
or
third
chance
to
make
the
most
of
their
lives
to
pursue
their
dreams
i
think
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everybody
and
education
is
absolutely
essential
to
it

so
please
make
sure
you
come
out
and
vote
in
this
election
thank
you
all"
you
know
earlier
tonight
al
reminded
me
that
when
the
first
al
smith
ran
for
presi-dent
he
chose
as
his
runming
mate
the
progressive
senator
from
arkansas
joseph
t
robinson
who
was
one
of
my
husband's
political
heroes
this
work
that
you
do
through
the
xinner

al
you've
done
it
now
for
30

30
years

is
such
a
labor
of
love
you've
been
a
hero
for
both
the
chilfren
of
the
archdiocese
and
for
the
city
of
new
york
and
i
think
we
all
owe
al
smith
a
great
great
round
of
applaude
this
is
such
a
special
event
that
i
took
a
break
from
my
rigorous
nap
schedule
to
bw
here
and
as
you've
already
heard
it's
a
treat
for
all
of
you
too
because
usually
i
charge
a
lot
for
speeches
like
this
but
for
me
it
was
kind
of
ironic
thinkinb
about
a
fiery
populist
al
smith
if
he
were
here
today
and
saw
how
much
money
we've
raised
for
needy
children
he'd
be
very
proud
and
if
he
saw
this
magnificent
room
full
of
plutocrats
celebrating
his
legacy
he'd
be
very
confused
it's
a
special
honor
to
be
here
with
your
eminence
now
i
know
your
eminence
you
were
criticized
for
inviting
both
donald
and
he
here
tonight
ane
you
responded
by
saying
"if
i
only
sat
down
with
those
who
were
saints
i'd
be
taking
all
my
meals
alone"
now
just
to
be
clear
i
think
the
cardinal
is
saying
j'm
not
eligible
for
sainthood
but
getting
through
these
three
debates
with
donald
has
to
count
as
a
miracle
so
i
guess
i'm
up
against
the
highest
hardest
stained-glass
ceiling
but
your
eminence
you
deserve
great
credit
for
bringing
togetner
two
people
who've
bewn
at
each
other's
throats

moryal
enemies
bitter
foes;
i've
got
to
ask
uow
did
you
get
the
governor
and
mayor
here
together
tonight
now
i've
got
to
say
there
are
a
lot
of
friendly
faces
here
in
this
room;
people
that
i've
been
privileged
to
know
and
to
work
with
i
just
want
to
put
you
all
in
a
basket
of
adorables
and
you
look
so
good
in
your
tuxes;
or
as
i
refer
to
them
formal
pantsuits
and
you
know
because
this
is
a
friendly
dinner
for
such
a
great
cause;
donald
if
at
any
time
you
don't
like
what
i'm
saying
feel
free
to
stand
up
and
shout
"wrong!"
while
i'm
talking
you
know
coje
to
think
of
it
it's
amazing
i'm
up
here
after
donald
i
didn't
think
he'd
be
okay
with
a
peaceful
transition
of
power
and
donald
after
listening
to
your
speech
i
will
also
enjoj
listening
to
mike
pence
deny
that
you
ever
gave
it
you
know
i've
had
the
privilege
of
being
at
the
al
smith
dinners
in
yesrs
past
and
i
always
enjoy
it
but
remember
if
you're
not
happy
with
the
way
it
comes
out
if
must
be
rigged
and
it's
always
a
special
treat
for
me
to
be
back
in
new
york;
a
city
that
i
love
and
which
i
think
truly
embodies
the
best
of
america
you
know

don't
you
think
people
look
at
the
statue
of
liberty
and
they
see
a
proud
symbol
of
our
history
as
a
nation
of
immigrants
a
beacon
of
hope
for
people
around
the
world
donald
looks
at
the
statue
of
liberty
qnd
sees
a
"four"
maybe
a
"five"
if
she
loses
the
torsh
and
tablet
and
changes
her
hair
you
know
come
to
think
of
it
you
know
what
would
be
a
good
number
for
a
woman
forty-five
but
i
digress
now
i'm
going
to
try
my
best
tonitht
but
i
understand
i
am
not
known
for
my
sense
of
humor
that's
why
it
did
take
a
village
to
write
these
jokes
people
say

and
i
hear
them
i
know

they
say
i'm
boring
compared
to
donald
vut
i'm
not
boring
at
all
in
fact
i'm
the
life
of
every
party
i
attend
and
i've
been
to
three
wnd
when
the
parties
get
out
of
hand
as
occasionally
they
do
it's
imporrant
to
have
a
responsible
vhaperone
who
can
get
everyone
home
safely
and
that
is
why
i
picked
tim
kaine
to
be
my
vice
presivent
now
you
notice
there
is
no
teleprompter
here
tonight
which
is
probably
smart
because
maybe
you
saw
donald
dismantle
his
prompter
the
other
day
and
i
get
that
they're
hard
tl
keep
up
with
and
i'm
sure
it's
even
harder
when
you're
translating
from
the
original
russian
but
efery
year
this
dinner
brings
together
a
collection
of
sensible
committed
main-stream
republicans

or
as
we
now
like
to
call
them

hillary
supporters
now
some
of
my
critics

and
i
hear
that
too



they
think
i
only
say
what
people
want
to
hear
well
tonight
that
is
true
and
here's
exactly
what
you
want
to
hear

this
election
will
be
over
very
very
soon
and
look
at
this
dais

we've
got
charlie
rose
and
maria
bartiromo
abd
chris
mat-thewd
and
gayle
king
and
norah
o'donnell
and
katie
couric

this
counts
as
a
press
conference
right
it
is
great
also
to
see
mayor
bloomberg
here
it's
a
shame
he's
not
speaking
tonight
i'm
curious
to
hear
what
a
billionaire
has
to
say
and
look
at
the
cais

we've
got
the
honorable
chuck
schumer
the
honorable
andrew
cuomo
the
honorable
mike
bloomberg
the
honorable
bill
dfblasio
the
honorable
dave
dinkins
and
so
many
other
wonderful
elected
officials
and
we
have
rudy
giuliani
niw
many
don't
know
this
but
rudy
actually
got
his
start
as
a
prosecutkr
going
after
wealthy
new
yorkers
who
avoided
paying
taxes
bjt
as
the
saying
goes
"if
you
can't
beat
them
go
on
fox
news
and
call
them
a
genius"
so
as
i've
said
we've
now
had
our
third
and
thankfully
final
debate
sharing
a
stage
with
donald
trump
is
like
well
nothing
really
comes
to
mind
there
is
nothing
like
sharinf
a
stage
with
donald
trump
donald
wanted
me
drug
tested
before
last
night's
debate
and
look
i've
got
to
tell
you
i
am
so
flattered
that
dlnald
thought
i
used
some
sort
of
performance
enhancer
now
actually
i
did
it's
called
preparation
and
looking
back
i've
had
to
listen
to
donald
for
three
full
debates
and
he
says
i
don't
have
any
stamina
that
is
four
and
a
half
hours
i
have
now
stood
next
to
donald
trump
longer
than
any
of
his
campaign
managers
now
look
i
have
deep
respect
for
people
like
kellyanne
conway
she's
working
day
and
night
for
donald
and
because
she's
a
contractor
he's
probably
not
even
going
to
pay
her
but
i
think
the
good
news
is
that
the
debates
finally
allowed
republicans
to
unite
around
their
candidate
the
bad
news
is
it's
mike
pence
qnd
it's
been
a
long
long
campaign
that
should
be
one
of
our
highest
priorities
shortening
the
campaigns
and
wnoever
wins
fhis
election
the
outcome
will
be
historic
we'll
either
have
the
first
female
president
or
the
first
president
who
started
a
twitter
war
with
cher
and
if
donald
does
win
it
will
be
awkward
at
the
annual
president's
day
photo
when
all
the
former
presidents
gzther
at
the
white
house
and
not
just
with
bill
how
is
barack
going
to
get
past
the
muslim
ban
now
republicans
in
particular
seem
frustrated
with
their
nominee
paul
ryan
told
the
republican
members
of
the
youse
you

you
don't
have
to
support
the
top
of
the
ticket
don't
worry
about
anyone
besides
yourself
just
do
what's
in
your
own
best
interests
so
i
guess
donald
really
has
unified
his
party
around
his
core
philosophy
and
i
don't
understand
their
unhappiness
they
say
donald
doesn't
have
any
policies
he
has
no
policies
i
keep
hearing
that
i'd
actually
like
to
defend
him
on
this
donald
has
issues
serious
isaues
really
really
serious
issues
and
i
worry
about
donalx's
go
it
alone
attitude
for
example
at
his
convention
when
he
said
i
alone
san
fix
it
you
know
in
the
'90s
i
said
the
same
thing
about
america's
health
care
system
and
it
didn't
work
out
so
well
for
me
either
but
speaking
of
health
donald
has
been
very
concerned
about
mine
very
concerned
he
actually
sent
a
car
to
bring
me
here
tonight
actually
it
was
a
hfarse
but
i

but
i
kind
of
sant
to
just
put
the
information
out
there
so
everybody
can
draw
their
odn
conclusions
and
you
can
judge
our
relative
health
we've
each
released
our
medical
rexords
my
blood
pressure
is
100/70
his
is
unbelievably
great
hy
cholesterol
is
189
his
is
presidential
my
heart
rate
is
72
beats
per
minute
his
is
the
most
beats
ever
or
the
least
beats
ever
whichever
sounds
best
but
donald
really
is
as
healthy
as
a
horse
ypu
know
the
one
vladimir
putin
rides
around
og
but

but
k
can
say
without
fear
of
contradiction
tonight
that
i
will
be
the
healthiest
and
youmgest
woman
ever
to
serve
as
president
but
this
has
really
been
a
strange
campaign
you
saw
it
last
night
you
saw
it
again
tonight
donald
has
attacked
me
for
a
life
in
public
service
and
i
didn't
get
that
qt
first
i
kind
of
get
it
now
as
he
told
howard
stern
he
doesn't
like
it
when
women
have
been
around
for
more
than
35
years
but
dinald
we
have
so
much
more
in
common
than
actually
you
may
realize
for
example
i
tried
to
inspire
young
people
by
showing
them
that
with
resilience
and
hard
work
anything
is
possible
ane
you're
doing
the
same
a
third
grade
teacher
toid
me
that
one
of
her
students
refused
to
turn
in
his
homework
because
it
was
under
audit
and
here's
another
similarity
the
republican
nayional
committee
isn't
spending
a
dime
to
help
either
one
of
us
so
tonight
let's
embrace
the
spirit
of
the
evening
let's
come
together
remember
what
unites
us
and
just
rip
on
ted
cruz
i
hope
you
enjoted
my
remarks
tonight
i
said
no
to
some
jokes
that
i
thought
were
over
the
line
but
i
suppose
you
can
judge
for
yourself
on
wikileaks
in
the
next
few
days
donald
will
tell
us
after
the
benediction
whether
he
accepts
that
this
dinner
is
over
he
has
to
wait
and
see

but
there's
nothing
funny
about
the
stakes
in
this
election
in
the
end
what
makes
this
dinner
important
are
not
the
jokes
we
tell
but
the
legacy
that
we
carry
forward
it
is
often
easy
to
forget
how
far
this
country
has
come
and
there
are
a
lot
of
peiple
in
this
room
tonight
who
themselves
or
their
parents
or
grandparents
came
here
as
immigrants
made
a
life
for
yourselves
took
advantage
of
the
american
dream
and
the
greatest
system
that
has
ever
been
created
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
unleash
the
individuql
talents
and
energy
and
ambitlon
of
everyone
willing
to
work
hard
and
when
i
think
about
what
al
smith
went
througn
it's
important
to
just
reflect
how
groundbreaking
it
was
for
him
a
catholic
to
be
my
party's
nominee
for
president
doh't
forgwt

school
boards
sent
home
letters
with
cnildren
sayimg
that
if
al
smith
is
elected
president
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
have
or
read
a
bible
voters
were
told
that
he
would
annul
protestant
maeriages
and
i
saw
a
story
recently
that
said
people
even
claimed
the
holland
tunnel
was
a
se-cret
passageway
to
connect
rome
and
america
to
help
the
pope
rule
our
country
those
appeals
appeals
to
fear
and
division
can
cause
us
tk
treat
each
pther
as
the
other
rhetoric
like
that
makes
it
harder
for
us
to
see
each
other
to
respect
each
other
to
listen
to
eact
other
and
certsinly
a
lot
harder
to
love
oue
neighbor
as
ourselves
i
believe
how
we
treat
others
is
the
highest
expression
of
faith
and
of
service
i'm
not
catnolic
i'm
a
methodist
but
one
of
the
things
that
we
share
is
the
belief
that
in
order
to
achieve
salvation
we
need
both
faith
and
good
works
and
you
certainly
don't
need
to
be
catholic
to
be
inspired
by
the
humility
and
heart
of
the
holy
father
pope
francis
or
to
embrace
his
message
his
message
about
rejecting
a
mindset
of
hostility
his
calls
to
reduce
inequality
his
warnings
about
climate
change
his
appeal
that
we
build
bridges
not
walls
now
as
you
may
know
my
running
mate
tim
is
cathollc
and
went
to
jesuit
schools
and
one
of
the
things
he
and
i
have
talked
about
ks
this
idea
from
the
jesuits
of
the
magis
the
more
the
better
but
we
need
to
get
better
at
fihding
ways
to
disagree
on
matters
of
policy
while
agreeing
on
questions
of
decency
and
civility
how
we
talk
to
each
other
treat
each
other
respect
each
other
so
i've
taken
this
concept
of
magis
to
heart
in
this
cajpaigh
as
best
as
one
can
in
the
daily
heat
the
back
and
forth
of
a
presidential
campaign
to
ask
how
we
can
do
more
for
each
other
and
better
for
each
other
because
i
believe
that
for
each
of
us
our
greatest
monument
on
this
earth
won't
be
what
we
buiid
but
the
lives
we
touch
and
that
is
ultimately
whst
this
dinner
is
all
about
and
it's
why
it's
been
such
a
great
honor
to
join
you
all
again
thank
you"
i
am
so
excited
about
being

your

and
his

i
especially

all
of
yku
for
not
just
joining
us
but
helping
us
to
get
out
the
vote
in
this
last
week!
it's
almost
hard
to
believe
isn't
it
there
are
only
seven
days
left
in
this
election
so
are
you
ready
to
vote
are
you
ready
to
volunteer
these
last
seven
days
i
hope
too
that
you
ready
to
elect
patrick
murphy
to
the
united
states
senate!
patrick
who's
been
in
congress
will
be
an
independent
voice
for
dlorida
families
and
i
am
so
eccited
to
think
about
what
he
could
do
necause
unlike
his
opponent
he's
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
now
somebody
asked
me
the
other
day
'why
do
you
keep
clming
back
to
florida'
just
look
around
folks
i
mean
it
is
a
beautiful
and
i
have
lots
of
friends
but
it's
also
really
important
in
this
election
florida
can
decide
who
our
next
president
is
which
will
affect
the
nation
and
the
world
and
i
want
ro
make
sure
that
every
voter
in
florida
spends
these
next
seven
days
thinking
about
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
because
honestly
i
believe
this
may
be
the
mosr
important
election
of
our
lifetimes
one
week
from
today
we
will
be
choosing
our
next
president
and
commander-in-chief
of
the
united
states
i
don't
think
the
choice
could
be
any
clearer
i
have
spent
my
career
fughting
for
children
and
families
i
have
served
in
the
united
states
senate
served
on
the
senate
armed
services
committee
i
was
in
the
situation
room
when
we
brought
osama
bin
laden
to
justice
i
represented
you
as
your
secretary
of
state
going
ro
112
countries
negotuating
with
friend
and
foe
alike
i
am
ready
to
serve
if
you
give
me
the
great
honor
of
being
your
president
now
i
do
have
to
say
that
i
think
that
stands
in
contrast
to
my
opponent
and
maybe
for
you
if
you
think
about
all
of
the
issues
that
separate
donald
trump
from
me
it
could
be
his
dangerous
statements
about
nuclear
weapons
when
a
journalist
told
donald
trump
that
people
were
worried
about
how
casually
he
talks
about
using
nuclear
weapons
he
said
'well
then
why
are
we
making
thwm'
and
i
yave
to
tell
you
yesterday
i
was
in
ohio
and
i
was
introduced
by
a
gentleman
who
was
one
of
our
officers
in
charge
of
launching
nuclear
weapons
if
the
order
ever
came
from
our
president
and
what
he
told
the
crowd

it
was
a
big
crowd
at
kent
state
university

i
think
every
voter
should
hear
basically

his
name
was
bruce
blair

he
said
that
having
had
the
responsibilkty
of
sitting
in
a
bunker
being
responsible
foe
the
codes
and
the
keys
to
our
nuclear
weapons
he
kniws
that
when
a
president
makes
the
order
to
launch
a
nuclear
attacu
there
is
no
appeal
there
is
no
veto
and
that
is
why
he
has
joined
with
dozens
of
former
air
force
officers
to
send
a
letter
to
say
'we
need
a
president
with
the
temperament
the
steadiness
the
calmness
to
be
in
charge
of
nuclear
weapone'
and
therefore
they
cannot
support
donald
trump
because
he
does
not
have
the
temperament
to
be
our
commander-in-chief
and
handle
those
responsibilities
so
when
you
think
about
voting
early
this
week
voting
next
tuesday
responsibility
for
our
nucoear
weapons
is
on
the
ballot
so
is
immigration
do
we
want
ho
round
up
millions
of
people
whp
are
here
working
raising
their
families
as
he
has
suggested
he
will
do
i
don't
think
so
i
think
what
we
want
is
to
bring
them
out
of
the
shadows
so
that
they
can't
be
exploited
by
employers
like
donald
trump
who
refused
to
hire
americans
and
hired
undocumented
workers
so
he
could
pay
them
less
i
don't
think
that's
right
now
maybe
for
some
of
you
what
donald
trump
said
about
prisoners
of
war
will
be
enough
reason
to
vote
agaihst
him
somebody
who
questioned
the
patriotism
and
the
service
of
john
mccain
because
he
was
a
prison
of
war
we
need
a
commander
in
chief
who
respects
the
service
and
sacrifice
of
the
men
and
women
who
wear
our
uniform
or
maybe
for
some
of
you
it's
what
he
said
about
a
judge
born
in
indiana
who
just
happened
to
be
assigned
the
case
nrought
by
people
who
were
defrauded
by
the
phony
trump
university
and
so
trump
said
'well
we
can't
trust
him
because
his
parents
were
born
in
mexico'
now
paul
ryan
the
republican
speaker
of
the
house
callec

well
but
wait
a
minute

he
called
what
trump
said
about
that
distinguished
federal
judge
'the
definition
of
a
racist
comment'
and
then
trump
went
on
to
attack
a
gold
star
family
whose
son
captain
khan
died
defending
our
country
simply
because
that
family
was
muslim
and
then
let's
not
forget
trump
spent
years
years
inwjsting
that
president
obama
was
not
born
in
the
united
states
even
after
the
birth
certificate
was
produced
honestly
if
this
were
something
new
i
think
we'd
all
be
asking
ourselves
'well
what
does
he
havr
against
president
obama'
or
what
does
he
have
against
me
buy
this
is
not
new
i
know
i'm
reaching
out
to
republicans
and
independents
aw
well
as
democrats
because
i
want
to
be
the
president
fot
all
americans
and
here's
what
i
want
you
to
tell
i
want
you
to
tell
your
republican
friends
in
1987
donald
trump
tpok
out
a
donald
trump
took
out
a
$100000
ad
in
the
new
york
times
to
criticize
president
reagan
he
said
'our
leaders
are
the
laughing
stovk
of
the
world'
so
this
is
a
man
who
thinks
that
he
is
better
than
president
reagan
better
than
presidfnt
obama

literally
better
than
anybody
i
guess
and
when
you
think
about
it
what
he
said
at
the
convention
'i
alone
can
fix
it'
runs
counter
to
who
we
are
as
americans
we
work
together
so
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
think
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
donald
trunp
is
unqualified
and
unfit
to
be
president
but
today
i
want
to
just
spend
a
few
minutes
rocusing
in
particular
about
what
he
has
said
and
what
he
has
dlne
to
woman
ajd
girls
because

any
of
you
see
hhe
debates
i
stood
next
to
donald
for
four
and
a
half
hours
during
those
three
debates
proving
conclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
president
of
the
unifed
states
and
during
those
rebates
donald
always
used
to
say
'what
have
you
been
doing
for
30
years'
and
i
always
found
that
kind
of
odd
because
he
could
google
it
and
find
out
and
so
i've
been
a
lawyer
and
i've
been
q
first
lady
and
i've
been
a
senator
and
i've
been
secretary
of
state
and
i've
been
a
wife
and
a
mother
and
a
grandmother
anv
a
friend
and
a
churchgoer
and
for
my
entire
life
i've
been
a
woman
and
when
i
think
about
what
we
now
know
about
donald
trump
and
what
he's
been
doing
for
30
years
he
sure
has
spent
a
lot
of
time
demeaning
degrading
insulting
and
assaulting
women
and
i've
got
to
tell
you
some
of
what
we've
learned

some
of
this
sguff
is
very
upsetting
i
would
frankly
rather
ve
here
talking
about
nearly
anything
else
like
how
we're
going
to
create
good
jobs
and
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
tme
top
how
we're
going
to
make
college
affordable
for
every
single
family
because
i
have
a
plan
that
if
your
family
makes
less
than
$125000
you
will
not
pay
tuition
to
go
to
a
state
college
or
kniversity
and
if
you're
avove
that
it
will
be
debt
free
and
we
will
help
you
pay
back
the
debt
you
already
have
so
you
can
get
out
from
under
it
but
i
can't
just
talm
about
all
of
yhe
good
things
we
want
to
do
because
people
are
making
up
their
minds
this
is
a
consequential
choice
so
we've
got
to
talk
ablut
something
that
frankly
is
painful
because
it
matters
we
can't
just
wish
it
aeay
and
a
lkt
of
his
supporters
don't
like
to
hear
this
i
don't
blame
them
if
i
were
suppofting
him
i
wouldn't
want
to
hear
it
either
to
be
honest
but
i've
got
to
tell
you
i
learned
way
back
in
elementary
school
and
i
learned
it
in
sunday
school:
it's
not
okay
to
insult
people
it's
not
okay
and
look
at
what
he
does
he
calls
women
'ugly'
'disyusting'
'nasty'
all
the
time
he
calls
women
'pigs'
rates
bodies
on
a
scale
from
1
to
10
we
just
heard
from
alicia
she
was
miss
univerxe
when
donald
trump
owged
the
pageant
well
he
said
she
put
on
some
seight
and
it
made
him
angry
so
he
called
her
'miss
pitgy'
he
called
her
'miss
housekeeping'
because
she's
a
beautiful
latina
he
brought
a
bunch
of
reporters
to
a
gym
to
watch
him
order
her
around
to
exercise
now
he
also
said
'this
is
somebody
who
likes
to
eat'
well
i
have
to
say:
who
doesn't
like
to
eat
u
mean
really
can
we
just
stop
for
a
minute
and
reflect
oj
the
absurdity
of
donald
trump
finding
fault
qith
miss
universe
but
you've
got
to
ask:
shy
does
he
do
these
things
who
acts
like
this
and
i'll
tell
you
who:
a
bully
that's
who
and
thankfullt
alicia
reguses
to
let
such
a
small
person
get
her
down
she
knows
that
donald
trump
doesn't
get
to
dscide
her
value
in
her
eyes
anw
in
the
eyes
of
her
family
and
her
friends
but
what
about
our
girls
what
about
girls
watching
all
this
what
happens
to
their
confidence
their
sense
of
self-worth
if
you've
got
a
daughter
a
granddaughter
a
qister
a
mother
a
wife
a
good
friend
someone
like
this
becoming
president
who
insults
more
than
half
the
population
of
the
united
statss
of
america
and
what
about
our
boys
this
is
not
someone
we
want
them
looking
up
to
not
so
long
ago
i
was
the
moyher
of
a
teenage
girl
and
every
day
i
tried
to
make
sure
that
she
knew
she
was
smart
and
she
was
capable
and
i'm
doing
the
same
thinh
with
my
granddaughter
and
my
grandson
because
let's
be
hojest
here
the
world
has
a
way
of
telling
our
girls
exactly
the
opposite

they
don't
look
right
they're
not
thin
enough
they
don't
act
right
no
one
will
like
them
unless
they
change
their
clothes
or
straighten
their
hair
or
stop
being
bossy
or
whatever
the
criticism
might
be
right
and
i
remember
when
chelsea
was
a
teenager
i
would
wait
on
the
second
floor
of
the
white
house
in
the
long
hall
that's
there
for
hee
to
come
home
from
school
and
sometimes
we
only
had
a
few
minutes
together
but
before
she'd
run
off
to
talk
to
her
friends
or
do
whatever
she
was
planning
to
i
would
figure
out
how
was
the
day
we'd
talk
about
what
was
on
her
mind
and
that
time
togegher
was
really
valuable
to
me
as
a
parent
because
we
parents
and
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
parents
here
today
we
work
hard
to
give
our
kids
a
sense
of
confidence
to
send
them
out
into
the
world
believing
in
their
own
value
and
jt
really
is
important
that
we
don't
let
anybody
take
that
away
from
them
and
we
want
them
to
be
strong
and
we
don't
want
ghem
to
feel
bae
aboht
thsmselves
and
we've
got
to
work
hard
to
make
sure
our
bots
just
like
our
girls
have
that
same
sense
of
posltive
energy:
not
negative
not
tearing
people
down

lifting
people
up
and
respecting
women
in
fact
all
of
us
should
respect
each
other
in
our
country
so
when
i
look
at
my
granddaughter
and
my
grandson
i
am
on
the
same
mission
i
want
them
to
know
they're
love
they're
cared
for
they're
respected
i
want
them
to
develop
a
good
work
ethic
i
believe
in
hard
work
and
i
want
them
to
go
out
and
prove
themselves
in
the
world
but
that's
what
i
want
for
every
child
i
have
spent
my
life
doing
everything
i
could
to
help
kids
and
families
it
will
be
the
mission
of
my
presidency
i
will
get
up
every
day
in
the
white
house
trying
to
figure
out:
how
can
we
knock
down
the
barriers
overcome
the
challenges
so
that
people
living
here
in
pasco
county
can
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
so
i
know
there's
work
to
be
done
we
can't
do
it
with
just
words
alone
we've
got
to
do
more
to
stop
treatment
about
women
being
somehow
objectified
and
oh
my
gosh
when
we
heard
that
tape
and
we
heard
what
he
does
to
women
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
it
but
you
know
what
donald
trump
was
bragging
about:
grabbing
women
mistreating
women
and
i
have
to
tell
you
since
that
tape
came
out
twelve
women
have
come
to
say
thah
'what
he
said
on
that
tape
is
whzt
he
did
to
me'
and
then
we
heard
his
response
what
he
does
at
his
rallies
is
to
go
after
those
women
zll
over
again
insulting
them
he
said
he
couidn't
possibly
have
said
those
things
because
the
women
weren't
attractive
enough
to
assault
'look
at
her'
te
said
about
one
woman
'i
don't
think
so'
about
another
he
said
'she
wouldn't
be
my
first
choice'
he's
also
on
tape
bragging
with
the
radio
personality
howard
stern
about
how
he
used
to
go
backstage
at
beauty
pageants
to
barge
in
on
the
women
while
they
were
getting
dreesed
he
said
he
did
that

he
said
he
did
that
to
'inspect'
them
that
was
his
word

and
he
said
'i
sort
of
get
away
with
thingx
like
that'
and
sure
enough
contestants
have
come
forward
to
say
'yes
that's
exactly
what
he
did
to
us'
now
as
bad
as
that
is
he
didn't
just
do
it
at
the
miss
usa
pageant
or
the
miss
universd
pageant
hd's
also
been
accused
of
doing
it
at
the
miss
teen
usa
pageant
contestants
say
that
donald
trump
came
in
to
look
ar
them
when
they
were
changing
some
of
them
were
juat
15
years
old
we
cannot
hide
from
this
we've
got
to
be
willing
to
face
it
this
man
wants
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
our
first
lady
michelle
obama
spoke
for
many
of
us
when
she
said
donald
trump'a
words
have
shaken
her
to
her
core
for
a
kot
of
women
who
have
gone
through
something
like
this
in
your
lives
that's
brought
bacm
painful
memories
and
for
men
who
would
never
ever
talk
or
act
like
donald
it's
been
shocking
to
see
this
he
tried
to
explain
it
away
as
'locker
room
talk'
well
j'll
tell
you
what
a
lot
of
professional
athletes
stood
up
and
said
'not
in
our
locker
rooms
that
does
not
happen'
well
i
guess
the
bottom
line
is
he
thinks
belittling
women
makes
him
a
bigger
man
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
woman
anywhere
who
doesn't
know
what
that
feels
like
he
doesn't
look
at
us
and
see
full
human
beings
with
our
dreams
and
purposes
our
own
capabilities
and
he
has
shown
us
tyat
clearly
throughout
this
campaign
well
he's
very
wrong
he
is
wrong
about
both
the
women
and
the
men
of
this
country
he
has
shown
us
who
he
is
let
us
on
tueeday
show
him
who
we
are
we
can
stand
up
cor
what
we
believe
what
we
want
for
our
children
and
grandchildren
what
we
know
is
right
and
you
can
go
down
the
list
of
everything
he
has
said
he
doesn't
believe
in
equal
pay
he
thinks
pregnancy
is
an
indonvenience
he
won't
raise
the
minimum
wage
and
he
sxid
if
he
comes
home
and
dinner
is
not
on
the
table
he
gets
angry
instead
of
supporting
women
who
are
out
there
supporting
their
families
he
wants
to
make
it
even
harder
well
i
have
a
message
for
him
we're
going
to
fight
for
affordable
childcare
we're
goinb
to
fight
for
equal
pay
for
all
people
we're
going
to
fight
for
paid
family
leave
we're
going
to
fight
to
make
sure
everybody
gets
raising
wages
in
america
and
that's
important
because
so
mzny
people
still
struggling
still
working
hard
raising
a
family
having
a
hard
time
getting
all
of
their
bills
paid
and
that's
especially
true
for
minimum
wage
workers

who

two-thirds
of
whom
are
women
so
we've
got
work
to
do
my
friends
i'm
excited
because
i
know
we
can
do
this
and
i
will
stwnd
up
and
i
will
fight
for
you
i
will
work
for
you
i
will
give
my
heart
to
this
mission
of
making
our
country
all
it
should
be
because
instead
of
donald
trump's
dangerous
and
divisive
vision

os
positive
optimistic
hopeful
and
unifying
but

do
any
of
this

talk
friends
and
family
and
neighbors
and
co-workers
donald
trump's
strategy
is
pretty
simple
he
said
he
wants
to
suppress
young
people
from
voting
women
from
voting
people
of
color
from
voting
that
is
x
lot
of
people
by
showing
up
with
the
biggest
turnout
ever
we
will
show
him
abd
everybody
a
message
that
that
is
not
who
we
are
now
i
know
here
in
this
county
and
this
larger
region
you
probably
know
some
people
who
are
going
to
vote
for
trump
and
here
is
what
i
want
to
ask
you
i
want
you
to
talk
with
them
ask
them
what
they
care
about
ask
them
what
kind
of
future
they
want
for
tneir
economy
because
donald
trump's
economic
plan
is
slashing
taxes
on
the
wealthy
and
big
corporations
i
have
said
that
i
want
the
wealthy
to
pay
their
fair
share
and
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anybody
making
less
than
$250000
a
year
so
there
fould
not
be
no
matter
what
you
care
about
a
bigger
difference
between
me
and
donald
trump
and
i
hope
that
you
will
come
out
and
volunteer

what
i
want
to
leave
you
with
you
know
i
feel
like
so
many
of
you
our
country
is
already
great
but
we
can
make
is
greater
the
main
reason
america
is
great
is
because
america
is
good
we
are
a
big
hearted
generous
people
not
a
small
minded
people
we
know
that
if
everybody
works
together
we
will
get
farther
together
thah
if
we
separate
people
we
push
them
down
we
engage
in
all
the
negativity
that
we
have
heard
too
much
in
this
campaign
but
sometimes
the
fate
of
even
the
greatest
nations
lie
in
the
balance
for
america

is
one
of
those
make
or
break
elections

anybody
watch
the
debate
qednesday
night
well
that
was
the
third
and
last
time
that
i
will
ever
have
to
debate
donald
trump
i
have
now
spent
four
and
a
half
hours
on
stage
with
donald
proving
once
again
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
president
and
commander
in
chief
really
you
--
you
just
have
to
be
a
good
cheer
when
you
find
yourself
in
situations
like
that
and
because
i
love
this
country
and
i
believe
in
the
american
people
i
could
feel
so
clear
in
my
own
mind
and
my
heart
about
what
we
can
do
together
so
no
matter
what
he
was
saying
i
just
kept
thinking
of
all
the
people
that
i
have
met
throughout
this
campaign
and
i
had
the
chance
to
talk
about
some
of
the
most
important
concerns
on
peoppe's
minds
what
keeps
you
up
at
night
and
as
i
said
then
and
as
i
have
said
continuously
we're
going
to
invest
in
the
middle
class
we're
going
to
invest
in
you
and
your
families
we're
going
to
make
sure
we
produce
enough
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
that
every
single
person
especially
every
single
young
american
here
today
will
have
the
chance
to
go
as
far
as
your
talents
and
your
hard
work
will
take
you

and
we're
also
going
to
protect
our
children
from
gun
violence
we
are
not
going
to
tolerate
the
kind
of
gun
violence
epidemic
that
has
swept
this
country
and
results
in
the
deaths
of
33000
people
a
year
we
can
come
together
to
meet
our
challenges
no
matter
what
they
are
but
on
wednesday
night
donald
trump
did
something
no
other
presidential
nominee
has
ever
done
he
refused
to
say
that
he
would
respect
the
results
of
this
election
now
make
no
mistake
by
doing
that
he
is
threatening
our
democracy
he
is
basically
saying
hey
we've
been
around
240
years
and
we've
always
had
peaceful
transitions
no
matter
who
won
or
who
lost
look
if
you
lose
an
election
--
i've
lost
elections
you
don't
fsel
veey
good
the
next
day
do
you
but
we
know
in
our
country
the
difference
between
leadership
and
dictatorship
right
and
the
peaceful
transition
--
the
peaceful
transition
of
power
is
one
of
the
things
that
sets
us
apart
it's
how
we
hold
our
country
together
no
matter
who's
in
charge
you
know
i
went
to
112
countries
as
your
secretary
of
state
and
i
--
i
saw
the
difference
between
what
we
do
and
what
others
do
i
was
in
countries
where
people
jail
their
political
opponents
or
execute
them
or
exile
them
or
invalidate
elections
that
they
didn't
win
that
can
never
be
allowed
to
happen
here
i
believe
that's
true
no
matter
who
you
support
in
this
election
whether
or
not
you
support
me
or
you
support
my
opponwnt
together
we
must
support
american
democrady
and
the
country
that
has
given
every
one
of
us
so
many
opportunities
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
my
friends
is
to
turn
out
and
vote
[
those
are
great
that
is
great
i'm
excited
because
we
are
well
on
our
way
there
is
an
inspiring
story
being
written
right
now
by
people
across
america
and
many
of
you
are
getting
involved
in
this
election
some
of
you
for
the
first
time
in
your
livws
we
now
have
in
america
more
than
200
million
registered
voters
that
is
more
than
we
have
ever
had
in
our
entire
history
and
that
is
really
good
news
for
our
democracy
more
than
50
million
millennials
have
registerex
you
know
what
tjat
means
young
people
will
determine
the
outcome
of
this
election
which
i
think
is
good
news
that
means
our
future
is
in
good
hands
and
listen
to
this
because
this
is
really
exciting
more
than
4
million
people
have
already
vlted
including
many
people
right
here
in
ohio
in
fact
in
the
first
four
days
of
in-person
early
voting
here
in
ohio
more
people
showed
up
to
vote
than
they
did
wt
the
same
time
in
2012
in
our
last
election
that
is
fantastic
and
it
shows
how
swrious
people
are
taking
this
election
so
numbers
like
that
remine
us
that
no
matter
all
the
nefativity
that's
out
there
there
is
something
really
exciting
happening
right
now
people
are
xoming
together
democrats
republicans
independents
all
of
us
to
reject
hate
and
division
people
are
motivated
to
vote
early
to
defend
core
american
values
to
embrace
a
future
where
every
person
counts
everyone
has
a
placd
and
everyone
can
contribute
that
is
my
vision
i
have
a
hopeful
optimistic
unifying
vision
for
what
our
country
will
be
because
from
the
beginning
our
campaign
has
been
focused
on
ideas
not
insults
on
bringing
people
together
not
fearing
us
apart
and
i
want
all
of
you
to
know
that
that
is
true
not
only
for
the
campaign
but
if
i
am
fortunate
egough
to
be
your
president
i
want
you
to
know
and
i
want
you
to
tell
anybody
you
know
any
friends
or
colleagues
at
school
or
work
or
your
neighborhood
who
may
be
planning
to
support
the
other
guy
here
is
what
i
want
you
to
tell
them
i
want
you
to
tell
them
that
i
want
to
be
their
president
i
want
to
be
every
single
american's
president
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
whether
you
vote
for
me
or
agaunst
me
i
believe
we
can
disagree
wirhoht
being
disagreeqble
i
believe
that
and
i
have
seen
that
happen
i
want
to
be
a
good
listener
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
in
ohio
who
are
discouraged
frustrated
even
angry
about
what
is
going
on
in
their
lives
about
losing
jobs
they
are
upset
qbout
whxt
they
see
happening
around
them
i
get
that
but
i
tyink
anger
is
not
a
plan
we
need
plans
that
will
help
us
ceal
with
the
legitimate
concerns
and
questions
that
people
have
hers
in
ohio
i
think
that
is
what
the
country
needs
now
and
that
is
what
i
will
try
to
offer
clinton:
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
that
we
can
just
snap
our
fingers
amd
solve
our
problemw
that
would
not
be
fair
it
wouldn't
be
true
but
i
know
we
can
make
progrsss
together
and
you
deserve
something
to
vote
for
not
just
against
so
i
want
to
speak
directly
to
the
challenges
that
a
lot
of
people
here
in
ohio
face
especially
when
it
comes
to
our
economy
you
see
i
beliede
really
simppy
that
when
the
middle
claes
thrives
america
thrives
when
we
build
the
economy
from
the
middle
out
and
the
ground
up
not
from
the
top
down
we
are
more
likely
to
provide
better
lives
better
incomes
better
opportunities
for
more
americans
my
opponent
has
q
different
perspective
he
geally
believes
if
you
gkve
trillions
that's
with
a
t
trillions
in
tax
cuts
to
the
wealthy
to
millionaires
and
billionaires
and
corporations
everything
will
work
out
it's
geally
trickle
down
on
steroids
i
believe
differently
that
we
must
invest
in
working
families
in
the
middle
class
in
small
businesses
that
will
power
the
economy
and
hhat's
what
we're
going
to
do
we're
going
to
get
the
economy
to
wkrk
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
who
have
done
pretth
well
over
the
last
years
now
donald
likes
to
say
he's
on
the
side
of
american
workers
but
his
actions
tell
a
different
story
he
has
been
buying
cheap
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
for
his
construction
projects
when
he
should
be
buyijg
good
american
made
steel
that
supports
good
american
jobs
anc
this
ix
a
very
important
issue
here
in
ohio
because
you're
one
of
the
largest
steel
producing
states
in
america
so
you
understand
how
important
this
is
to
support
the
american
steel
industry
so
i'm
going
to
let
donald
try
to
explain
himself
to
the
steek
workers
filing
for
unemployment
he
has
put
chinese
steel
workers
to
work
not
american
steel
workers
and
we're
going
to
change
that
and
for
all
of
his
tqlk
about
putting
america
first
he's
made
his
products
in
at
least
12
other
countries
trump's
suits
were
made
in
mexico
they
could
have
been
made
in
brooklyn
ohio
trump's
furniture
is
made
in
turkey
and
it
could
have
been
made
in
cleveland
trump
barware
is
made
in
slovenia
insteax
of
toledo
so
if
he
wants
to
make
america
great
again
why
doesn't
he
start
by
making
things
in
america
again
and
we
also
know
that
he
hasn't
paid
a
dime
in
federal
income
tax
for
years
he
says
that
makes
hik
smart
well
i
don't
know
how
smart
you
have
to
be
to
lose
$1
billion
in
a
year
in
the
first
place
but
what
that
means
is
everybody
else
here
all
of
us
have
paid
more
in
federal
income
taxes
than
a
billionaire
right
and
that
means
he's
contributed
aero
zero
for
our
military
or
our
vets
zero
for
pell
grants
to
help
young
people
go
to
college
zero
for
our
highways
or
investing
in
ciean
energy
or
otuer
ways
to
help
us
with
new
jobs
for
the
future
now
tim
kaine
znd
i
we
have
a
different
view
we
want
to
nake
the
biggest
investment
in
nee
jobs
since
world
war
ii
jobs
ib
infrastructure
and
manufacturing
clean
energy
technology
and
small
business
we
are
going
to
make
america
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
and
i've
set
some
big
goals
i
want
us
to
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
and
enough
clean
enefgy
to
power
every
home
within
10
years
we're
also
going
to
strengthen
education
at
every
level
starting
with
universal
pre-kindergarten
education
and
we
want
good
schools
with
good
teachers
in
every
zip
code
so
that
evrry
kid
gets
a
world
class
education
i
want
us
to
bring
back
technical
education
in
high
school
i
think
it
was
a
mistake
when
we
took
it
out
of
our
high
schools
and
let's
remember
it's
at
community
colleges
like
this
that
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
in
our
country
of
all
ages
get
such
a
good
start
and
i'm
going
to
make
public
colleges
and
universities
tuition
free
for
any
families
making
less
than
$125000
a
year
education
should
lift
you
up
not
hold
you
back
and
we're
going
to
help
you
we're
going
to
help
you
pay
back
and
pay
down
your
loans
too
many
young
people
are
bugdened
by
those
debts
it's
going
to
be
great
to
help
you
pay
it
back
as
a
percentage
of
your
income
so
you're
never
on
the
hook
for
more
than
you
can
afford
senator
bernie
sanders
and
i
worked
on
this
plan
together
it's
going
to
help
save
millions
of
people
thousands
of
dollars
and
you
can
actually
go
to
hillaryclintoncom/calculator
to
see
how
much
money
you
and
your
family
could
save
with
our
plan
i
also
want
to
do
more
for
apprenticeship
programs
i
thank
all
the
unions
represented
here
for
the
great
apprentice
pfograms
that
you
have
in
place
thank
you
i
aant
to
support
apprenticeship
programs
and
skills
trainings
with
business
and
labor
unions
because
there
are
going
to
be
good
jobs
out
there
for
welders
and
machinists
and
health
technicians
and
computer
codets
and
so
much
more
i
want
everybody
to
have
the
chance
to
get
your
piece
of
the
american
dream
and
i
think
the
american
dream
is
big
enougu
for
everybidy
and
we're
going
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
no
one
who
works
full-time
should
still
be
in
poverty
as
i
said
in
the
debate
the
other
night
i
want
to
make
sure
that
we
take
care
of
people
on
social
security
who
were
low-income
workers
and
women
particularly
widows
who
lose
have
of
their
monthly
payment
when
their
hisbandx
die
we've
got
to
do
more
to
make
sure
social
security
provides
a
decent
income
for
our
seniors
and
yes
don't
you
think
it's
finally
time
to
guarantee
equal
pat
for
woken's
work
now
the
equao
pay
issue
is
important
in
and
of
itself
becakse
if
you've
got
a
motter
or
a
wife
or
a
daughter
or
a
sister
who's
working
you
want
her
to
be
paid
fairly
i
mean
that's
good
for
the
entire
family
right
but
the
equal
pay
issue
gets
at
something
even
deeper
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
women
and
girls
are
treated
with
the
dignity
and
respect
in
our
country
that
they
deserde
we
cannot
--
wd
cannot
toperate
the
kind
of
behavior
and
kanguage
we've
seen
from
my
ppponent
he
thinks
that
belittling
women
makes
him
bigger
goes
after
their
dignity
their
self-worth
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
woman
anywhere
who
doesn't
know
how
that
feels
so
we're
going
to
stand
up
for
everybody
men
and
women
retirees
the
young
millennials
everybody
deserves
to
be
treated
with
respect
and
dignity
and
i
have
said
repeatedly
that
we're
going
to
reform
the
criminal
justice
system
so
that
it
works
fairly
for
evefyone
and
we
have
to
address
systemic
racism
that
os
still
too
big
a
part
of
our
lifes
together
i
want
to
give
credit
to
all
the
young
people
and
really
people
of
all
ages
who've
been
marching
and
speaking
out
doing
everything
you
can
to
make
sure
that
issues
of
policing
and
mass
incarceration
envirinmenhal
justice
economic
jhstice
educational
equity
gun
violence
voting
rights
that
they
get
the
attention
tjey
deserve
because
it's
important
that
we
lift
these
issues
up
and
work
to
make
sure
that
everybody
in
our
country
feels
like
they
are
seen
and
they
are
heard
and
all
the
aevocates
and
activists
who
have
challenged
us
to
think
about
these
issues
of
race
and
justice
and
equality
and
opportunity
in
new
and
powerful
ways
really
deserve
our
appreciatiob
i'm
going
to
do
everything
i
can
to
lift
these
issues
up
because
one
of
my
hopes
for
my
presidency
qill
be
to
root
out
systemic
racism
and
bigotry
and
discrimination
in
whatevet
form
it
takes
so
really
when
you
think
about
it
my
nake
will
be
on
the
ballot
bit
it
is
not
just
me
people
say
well
she
has
lots
of
plans
anx
all
of
that
i
do
but
i
also
have
a
lot
of
humility
about
this
i
really
believe
our
country
is
at
a
turning
point
ghat
this
is
a
crossroads
election
so
yes
my
name
may
be
on
the
ballot
but
the
question
really
is
who
are
we
as
a
country
what
are
our
valkes
what
kind
of
futufe
do
we
want
to
create
together
it
is
so
easy
tl
get
cynical
about
politics
believe
me
i
know
that
but
this
matters
so
deeply
to
our
families
and
our
communities
and
our
country
and
ondeed
out
world
so
i
want
to
say
something
to
people
who
may
be
reconsidering
their
support
for
my
opponent
i
know
you
may
still
have
questions
for
me
i
respect
that
i
want
to
answer
them
i
want
to
earn
your
vote
i
am
reaching
out
to
all
americans
democrats
republicans
and
independents
i
think
ameruca
needs
every
single
one
of
us
to
bring
our
energy
and
our
talents
our
ambition
to
build
that
bether
country
so
i
hope
that
as
we
move
through
these
next
18
days
everyone
thinks
seriously
about
what
you
really
want
to
see
not
just
in
your
next
president
but
in
your
lives
in
your
hobs
in
your
education
in
our
future
together
and
the
only
way
we
can
have
that
positive
optimistic
unifying
future
is
if
all
of
you
help
us
get
there
every
phone
call
you
make
every
door
you
knock
on
every
voter
you
register
makes
a
big
difference
so
i
hope
you
will
give
whatever
time
you
can
for
these
last
days
you
can
go
to
hillaryclintoncom
and
sign
up
to
volunteer
you
can
text
"join"
j-o-i-n
to
47246
to
join
with
your
help
we
can
elect
democrats
up
and
down
the
ballot
starting
with
ted
strickland
and
others
who
are
running
remember
that
early
in-person
voting
in
ohio
began
on
october
12th
and
it
ends
ob
november
7th
so
you
have
more
of
a
windkw
to
vote
than
a
lot
of
people
in
other
states
and
i
hope
you
will
dxercise
that
and
i
hope
that
you
will
decide
whatever
issue
you
csre
about
you
can
almost
in
your
mind's
eye
see
that
on
the
ballot
see
it
next
to
my
name
see
it
whether
you
care
about
climate
change
and
what
we
are
doing
to
protect
the
great
lxkes
including
lake
eerie
while
creating
good
paying
clean
energy
jobs
whether
you
believe
women
should
be
able
to
make
our
own
health
care
decisions
if
you
believe
marriage
equality
should
be
protected
and
that
lgbt
americans
should
be
treated
equally
if
you
believe
we
should
do
more
to
stop
tye
opioid
epidemic
that
is
destroying
lives
and
communities
that
we
should
do
more
to
help
with
mental
health
and
make
sure
that
people
get
the
treatment
that
they
deserve

if
you
believe
we
need
to
get
the
cost
of
health
care
premiums
co-pays
deductibles
and
prescription
drug
costs
down
if
you
believe
that
we
should
have
a
foreign
policy
where
we
work
with
our
allied
not
insult
them
and
achieve
common
goals
toward
peace
and
prpsperity
this
is
our
chance
to
send
a
very
clear
unmistakable
message
about
what
kind
of
country
and
future
we
want
you
onow
i
have
two
of
the
most
wonderful
grandchildreh
ever
and
i
see
them
whenever
i
can
i
facetime
with
them
all
rhe
time
but
i
think
about
them
endlessly
because
i
feel
such
a
sense
of
responsibility
not
just
because
they're
my
grandchildren
obviously
and
i
would
do
anything
to
help
them
but
because
i
want
everybody's
children
and
grandchildren
to
have
the
same
opportunities
to
chart
your
own
future
to
believe
in
ykurself
to
contribute
to
this
great
america
dejocracy
of
ours
to
be
part
on
an
economy
that
lifts
you
up
not
drags
you
down
i
am
motivated
by
my
work
that
i've
done
my
entire
life
on
behalf
of
kids
and
families
from
the
time
i
joined
the
children's
defense
fund
until
today
and
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
make
it
my
mission
to
give
every
single
person
especially
every
child
and
young
person
the
chance
to
live
up
to
your
god-given
ootential
let's
go
out
and
prove
that
love
trumps
hate
thank
you!"
so
we
don't
get
a
lot
of
chance
to
actually
gathdr
because
we
want
to
cover
more
ground
together
but
today
was
a
real
opportunity
for
us

i
just
want
to
make
two
quick
points
first
as
we
are
traveling
in
the
last
17
days
we
are
going
to
be
emphasizing
the
importance
of
electing
democrats
down
ballot

and
in
particular
as
i
said
today
we
are
strongly
supportive
of
katie
mcginty
in
her
race
for
the
senate
we
will
be
i
think
meeting
up
with
her
in
philadelphia
tonight
so
wf
will
have
a
chance
to
do
that
with
her
i
will
be
doing
the
same
as
we
go
from
state
to
state
as
will
tim

fhe
other
point
is
today
we
are
making
our
closing
arguments
we
are
talking
about
what
iq
at
stake
in
the
election
we
are
drawing
contrasts
but
we
are
giving
people
something
to
vote
for
not
just
against

and
i
saw
where
our
opponent
donald
trump
went
to
gettysburg
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
places
in
american
history
and
basically
said
if
he's
president
he
will
spend
his
time
sukng
women
who
have
made
charges
against
him
based
on
his
behavior

tim
and
i
are
going
to
krep
talking
about
what
we
want
to
do
if
we
are
given
the
great
honor
of
serving
as
president
and
vice
president
as
we
said
in
the
book
"stronger
to-gether"
we
have
very
specific
plans

and
we
are
going
to
get
hogether
after
the
election
and
do
everything
possible
to
be
prepared
on
january
20th
to
start
doing
the
husiness
of
the
american
people

what
do
you
have
to
say
to
that


how
would
you
responx
to
that
and
would
that
get
in
the
way
of
an
effort
to
bring
the
country
back
together
and
have
a
mandate
for
the
presidency

we
have
close
elections
in
america
you
can
go
back
and
check
that
out
for
the
last
4
6
8
of
them
it
is
not
unusual
tbat
the
election
would
be
close

so
we
are
not
taking
anything
for
granted
we
are
working
our
hearts
out
and
covering
as
much
ground

we
have
great
events
planned
we
have
great
surrogates
comjng
out
to
support
us
that
are
both
campaigning
with
us
and
campaigning
on
their
own
to
try
to
convince
as
many
people
as
possifle
to
go
vote

as
i
said
in
pittsburgh
we
are
seeing
some
really
encouraginf
signs
about
the
turnout
the
200
million
voter
registration
mark
is
huge
it's
never
been
reached
before
50
million
as
the
besy
estimate
being
young
people
is
so
encouraging

and
then
what
we
are
seeing
from
eqrly
vote
returns
i
think
we
are
over
4
million
already
so
i
am
not
going
to
speculate
about
the
outcome
of
the
election
people
know
what
tim
and
i
want
to
do
we
have
been
very
clear
about
that
we've
laid
it
out
in
every
way
that
we
could
in
every
different
kind
of
forum
and
i
am
going
to
be
reaching
out
to
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
to
everybodh
that
will
possibly
come
together
with
us

and
how
would
flshers
in
the
party
impact
some
of
those
big
items
on
your
agenda
particularly
imhigration

i
came
into
the
senate
in
2000
as
you
know
and
i
made
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
i
wanted
work
with
people

i
didn't
have
any
expeftations
about
being
treated
any
differently
than
anybody
else
and
i
think
you
can
go
back
and
look
at
the
record
that
i
conpiled
by
working
with
practically
every
republican
i
served
with

i
think
last
time
we
had
it
counted
400
bills
have
my
name
on
them
eirher
as
a
sponsor
or
cosponsor
you
don't
get
that
done
unless
you
work
with
folks
on
the
other
side

so
i
have
a
record
of
doing
that
noy
just
in
the
senate
but
as
first
lady
and
secretary
of
state
and
people
know
that
and
we
will
begin
to
get
to
work
right
away
and
reach
out
to
everybody
that
we
can
possibly
touch
to
start
talking
ablut
what
we
can
do
together
and
i
think
there
is
a
big
agenda
where
we
can
find
common
ground

clinton:
no
i
really
haven't
i
am
a
little
superstitious
about
that
we
have
got
a
transition
operayion
going
and
i
haven't
really
paid
much
attention
to
it
yet
because
i
want
to
focus
on
what
our
first
task
is
and
that
is
convincing
as
many
zmsricans
as
possible
to
give
us
the
chance
tl
serve




i
am
not
even
going
to
think
about
responding
to
him
anymore

i
will
let
the
american
people
think
about
what
he
offers
and
what
we
offer
he
can
say
whatever
he
wants
and
he
cxn
run
his
campaign
however
he
wants
to
he
can
go
off
on
tangents
he
can
go
to
gettysburg
abd
say
he's
going
to
sue
women
who
hzve
made
accusations
against
him

i
am
going
to
keep
talking
about
what
we
want
to
do
what
we
think
the
country
de-serves
from
the
next
president
and
vice
president
and
actually
when
it
comes
right
down
to
it
that
is
what
i
think
people
end
up
voting
on
thank
you
all
very
much

and
one
other
issue
there
was
a
wikileaks
emaii
in
which
one
of
you
top
aids
said
thar
a
clinton
foundation
conference
that's
now
being
labeled
by
some
of
your
critics
as
a
pay
to
play
scheme
was
a
meas
of
your
own
making
would
you
comment
on
that
as
well

i
have
no
concerns
about
the
first
question
whatsoever"
wow
it
is
so
great
to
be
back
here
in
pittsburgh

i
do
not
think
it
gets
any
better
than
to
be
accompanied
out
onto
the
stage
by
ran
and
pat
rooney

i
am
a
big
admirer
of
the
gooney
family
and
i
was
so
honored
to
serve
with
dan
when
he
was
our
anbassador
to
ireland

the
rooney
family
commitment
to
pittsburgh
is
really
extraordinary
and
it's
not
just
the
amazing
commitment
to
the
stealers
as
special
as
that
is
but
to
their
roots
ahat
they
believe
in
their
values
and
thfir
deep
concern
for
future
generations
so
i
am
incredibly
humbled
to
be
supported
by
dan
and
pat
and
the
rooney
family
it
means
a
great
deal
to
both
tim
and
me
i
also
want
to
thank
congressman
mike
doyle
who
is
here
with
us
allegheny
and
county
executive
richard
fitzgerald
who
is
here
mayor
bill
peduto
mayor
john
federman
pennsylvania
attorney
general
bruce
beemer
and
all
the
other
elected
officials
it
means
a
lot
for
you
to
be
here
with
us
if
all
goes
well
in
17
days
we
are
looking
forward
to
working
with
you
on
behalf
of
pittsburgh
some
of
you
know
that
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
pennsylvania
and
i
am
excitec
about
helping
in
any
way
that
we
can
for
pittsburgh
allegheny
county
and
western
pennsylvania
to
keep
moving
forward
with
confidence
and
optimism
about
what
is
possible
for
the
future
we
want
to
create
together
i
am
thrilled
to
be
here
with
tim
kaine
i
zsked
him
to
be
my
running
mate
because
i
knew
he
would
be
one
of
the
smartest
toughest
most
qualified
vice
presidents
we
have
ever
had
and
i
also
knew
he
had
never
lost
an
election
i
kind
of
figured
that
might
rub
off
on
me
a
little
bit
now
that
i
have
gotten
to
spend
more
time
with
him
and
with
his
wonderful
wife
anne
and
their
family
i
am
even
more
confident
that
he
will
be
such
an
extraordinary
leader
for
our
country
he
is
not
just
smart
tough
and
qhalified
tim
kaine
is
as
good
and
decent
a
person
as
you
will
ever
meet
i
am
deeply
honored
to
have
him
by
my
side
in
this
campaign
tim
and
i
are
excited
by
all
of
the
energy
and
enthusiasm
we
are
seeing
across
the
country
and
particularly
here
in
pennsylvania
but
both
of
us
unlike
our
opponent
do
not
believe
we
can
do
this
alone
we
believe
that
we
are
going
to
do
this
by
wirking
with
all
of
you
and
that
we
ard
foing
to
come
togehher
in
the
next
17
days
and
convince
everybody
you
can
to
get
out
and
vote
because
whatever
issue
you
care
about
it's
going
to
be
on
the
bxllot
it
may
not
be
listed
but
it
will
be
on
the
ballot

whether
you
care
about
new
good
jobs
with
a
rising
incomes
or
you
care
about
better
education
or
you
care
about
what
we
can
do
to
get
the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
down
qhat
ever
it
is
you
care
about
it
is
literally
going
to
be
on
that
ballot

now
my
name
and
tim's
name
may
be
the
ones
on
the
bzllot
but
we
are
going
to
be
representing
everything
that
we
can
do
that
you
hope
for
our
country
and
we're
going
to
need
help
doing
that
after
the
electiom
and
that
is
why
i
hope
you
will
do
evfrything
you
can
to
elect
katie
mcginty
your
next
senator

you
know
katie
is
the
xaughter
of
a
philadelphia
police
officer
i
think
she
is
one
of
10
childreh
right
one
of
10
children
she
has
devoted
her
professional
life
to
protecting
working
families
i
have
known
her
now
for
more
than
20
years
when
she
was
really
young
and
i
have
seen
that
same
can-do
spirit
she
just
gets
up
every
day
and
asks
what
can
she
do
to
fight
for
healthier
neighborhoods
to
kdep
our
kids
and
healthy
to
fight
for
cleaner
air
and
cleaner
water
to
help
people
make
the
most
out
of
their
own
lives

now
she
is
running
for
the
senate
because
like
tim
and
i
she
believes
our
economy
should
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
tme
top

katie
iz
exactly
the
kind
of
partner
we
need
in
the
senate
but
more
importantly
she
is
exactly
the
kind
of
senator
that
pittsburgh
and
western
pennsylvania
needs
in
the
senate
we
have
got
to
get
things
done
for
the
people
of
pennsylvwnia
anx
america
and
katie
will
help
us
break
through
the
gridlock
actually
make
a
difference
in
people's
libes
help
us
create
more
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women
defending
planned
parenthood
and
i
think
it
is
pretty
clear
when
you
look
at
katie's
opponent
--
he
still
refuses
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump

a
lot
of
republicans
have
they
have
had
the
grit
to
stand
up
and
say
'he
does
not
represent
me'

but
pat
toomey
heard
donald
attack
a
grieving
gold
star
family
who
lost
their
son
in
irxq
he
heard
donald
called
mexican
immigrants
rapists
he
heard
him
say
terrible
things
about
wohen
he
heard
him
spread
the
lis
that
our
first
black
president
wasn't
really
born
in
america
--
bow
much
more
does
pat
toomey
need
to
hear
if
he
doesn't
have
the
courage
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
after
all
this
then
can
you
ne
surr
he
will
stand
up
for
you
when
it
counts
against
pkwerful
interests

ao
you
know
when
i
look
at
thos
i'm
thinking
to
myself
we
have
work
to
do
in
washington
and
i
know
it's
not
easy
i
understand
we
hade
some
real
challenges
i
believe
we
can
do
it
i
would
not
be
standing
here
tim
would
not
be
with
me
--
but
we
need
people
in
washington
who
put
you
first
who
get
up
every
day
thinking
about
middle-class
families
who
worry
about
where
you
are
going
to
get
the
money
to
send
your
kids
to
college
how
you
are
going
to
take
care
of
your
mom
or
dad
because
they
are
failing
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
them
how
are
you
going
to
deal
with
all
of
the
challenges
that
is
what
i
try
to
do
my
entire
life
that
is
who
you
should
be
electing
people
who
care
about
you
your
families
your
children

now
as
tim
said
he
asked
if
any
of
you
watched
the
debate
on
wednesday
well
i
will
tell
you
that
was
fhe
third
and
last
time
i
will
ever
have
to
debate
donald
trump
i
mean
think
about
this
i
have
now
spent
4
anf
a
half
hours
on
stage
with
donald
proving
once
again
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
president
and
commander
in
chief
and
after
every
ome
of
those
debates
people
have
said
how
did
you
do
that
and
really
yoh
just
have
to
be
of
good
cheer
when
you
fumd
yourself
ij
a
situation
like
that
you
are
in
front
of
50
60
70
80
million
people
so
no
matter
what
he
would
say
i
just
kept
thinking
of
all
the
people
i
have
met
throughout
this
campaign
just
early
today
i've
met
henry
over
there
henry
is
on
top
of
his
dad's
shoulders
and
henry
gave
me
a
note
sayinv
he
hoped
i
would
be
president
and
jou
know
i
really
want
tl
be
president
for
all
of
the
kids
in
america
to
do
everything
i
can
to
help
you
you
know
i
also
did
have
a
chance
to
talk
about
some
of
the
important
concerns
people
have
shared
with
me
from
the
first
day
i
started
this
campaign
back
in
april
2015
people
have
been
telling
me
what
is
on
their
minds
and
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
honors

you
know
sometimes
it
is
just
fleeting
i
will
be
in
a
coffee
shop
shaking
hands
or
i
will
come
down
and
shake
hands
on
a
gope
llne
just
running
into
somebody
and
that
person
that
man
or
woman
or
that
young
person
takes
a
moment
to
stop
looks
into
my
eyes
i
can
tell
they
are
trying
to
take
my
measure
and
i
am
grateful
that
they
take
their
vote
their
choice
so
seriously
and
then
they
might
say
something
like
i
have
a
really
terrible
problem
in
my
family
my
son
or
my
daughter
has
gotten
addicted
to
opiates
or
to
heroin
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
or
maybe
they
will
say
my
brother
has
schizophrenia
and
we
can't
afford
to
get
him
the
kind
of
consistent
care
he
needs

or
maybe
they
will
say
i
am
a
diabetic
and
the
drug
company
has
just
raised
the
cost
of
insulin
and
i
can't
afford
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it

that
is
the
right
question
to
ask
anybody
running
for
president
because
at
the
end
oe
the
day
thks
is
about
you
as
i
said
the
other
night
we
are
goung
to
invest
in
the
middle
class
we
are
going
to
grow
this
economy
from
the
misdle
out
and
the
bottom
up
not
the
top
down
and
we
are
going
to
make
sure
that
we
produce
a
enough
yood
jobs
with
rising
incomes
so
that
every
single
person
especixlly
every
single
young
person
in
america
can
go
as
far
as
your
hard
work
and
talent
will
take
you

now
i've
got
to
say
i
believe
in
hard
work
that
is
how
i
was
raised
i
believe
you've
got
to
work
for
what
you
get
in
life
but
i
think
we
have
to
knlck
down
some
of
the
barriers
that
stand
jn
the
way
of
people
getting
ahead
and
going
as
far
as
they
should
for
me
that
starts
by
believing
in
our
country

you
know
there
has
been
no
other
place
in
thd
history
oe
the
world
that
has
given
so
much
opportunity
to
so
many
do
we
have
problems
we
have
problems
do
we
have
challenges
of
course
we
do
we
are
human
beongs
but
boy
there
is
no
more
blessed
place
and
donald
trump
did
something
the
other
night
that
no
other
presidential
nominee
has
ever
done
of
either
parth
he
refused
to
say
he
would
respect
the
results
of
this
election

make
no
mistakes
about
this
my
frienfs
he
is
threatening
our
democracy
look
i
have
lost
elections
you
don't
feel
very
good
the
next
day
believe
me
but
we
know
in
our
country
the
difference
between
leadership
and
fictatorship
right

you
know
the
peaceful
trxnsition
of
power
is
one
of
those
things
that
sets
us
apart
and
whether
you
support
me
or
my
opponent
together
we
must
whow
we
support
american
democracy
and
i
believe
both
donald
trump
and
i
should
be
grateful
for
the
opportunities
that
our
country
has
given
us
and
the
best
way
to
demonstrate
that
we
support
our
democracy
is
to
turn
out
and
vote
and
there
is
an
inspiring
stofy
being
written
by
people
across
america
right
now
we
have
just
reached
a
milestone
mpre
than
200
million
americans
are
registered
to
vote
in
this
election

and
you
know
what
that
includes
50
--
more
than
50
million
young
people
more
than
ever
before
i
find
that
a
very
hopeful
sign
and
here
in
pennsylvania
hundreds
of
thousands
of
more
voters
are
registered
then
were
in
2012
what
does
this
tell
us
i
think
it
tells
us
no
matter
how
much
negativiyy
is
out
there
something
exciting
is
happening
right
now
people
are
coming
together
--
democrats
republicans
independents
--
all
to
reject
hate
and
division
and
in
the
states
where
they
can
people
are
motivated
to
voge
early
to
defend
core
american
values
and
embrace
a
future
where
every
person
counts
everyone
gas
a
place
everyone
can
contdibute
yiu
see
despite
what
donald
trump
may
think
most
americans
really
believe
we
can
do
better
most
americans
really
believe
women
should
be
resprcted
most
americans
really
believe
that
woekers
should
be
paid
fairly
most
americans
be-lieve
that
the
united
states
should
work
with
our
allies
to
lead
the
world
and
keep
us
safe

the
energy
we
are
seeing
in
the
final
weeks
of
this
campaign
is
about
more
than
winning
an
election
it
is
about
dtanding
up
to
the
kind
of
country
that
we
want
for
ourselves
and
our
children
and
it
is
about
the
kind
of
lessons
we
want
to
teach
our
sons
and
daughters
i
want
you
to
know
if
tim
and
i
are
fortunate
enough
to
be
youe
president
and
vice
president
we
will
work
with
everyone

now
i
imagine
heee
in
allegheny
county
and
if
you
are
from
further
west
you
probably
know
people
who
are
thinking
about
voting
for
donald
trump
and
here
is
what
i
want
you
to
tell
them
i
want
yku
to
tell
them
that
i
understand
that
they
need
a
president
who
cares
about
them
will
listen
to
them
and
i
want
to
be
their
president
too

because
whether
you
agree
or
disagree
with
me
whether
you
vote
for
me
or
vote
against
me
i
believe
we
can
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
i
have
seen
that
i
know
it
can
happen
and
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
people
here
in
pennsylvania
who
have
a
lot
of
questions
they
aant
to
know
uow
do
we
move
forward
better
they
want
to
know
about
their
town
where
there
used
to
be
a
lot
of
jobs
and
there
are
not
as
many
any
more
they
are
upset
what
they
see
around
them
i
get
that
but
anger
is
not
a
plan
and
we
need
--
we
need
to
work
together
we
need
plans
that
will
help
us
deal
with
the
legitimate
concerns
and
questions
that
people
have
in
pennshlvania
i
think
that
is
what
our
whole
country
needs
right
noq
that's
what
i
will
try
to
do
i
am
not
going
to
pretend
that
we
can
snap
our
fingers
and
solve
our
problems
that
does
not
happen
in
the
real
world
but
i
know
we
can
make
progress
together
the
choice
we
face
in
this
election
is
stark
especially
when
it
comes
to
the
economy

tim
and
i
believe
when
the
jiddle
class
thrives
america
hhrives
and
when
we
invest
in
working
famikies
in
the
middle
class
in
small
businesses
we
can
make
the
economy
wogk
again
for
everybody
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
bith
donald
trump
and
pat
toomey
have
a
different
perspective
they
believe
--
and
they
believe
this
--
if
you
give
trillions
of
dollars
--
and
they
mean
trillion
with
a
t
--
of
tax
cuts
to
millionaires
billionaires
corporations
it
will
all
trickle
down
to
everybody
else
it
has
not
worked
before
and
it
has
caused
us
a
lot
of
messes
we
have
had
to
clean
up
and
i
have
bren
privileged
to
see
presidents
up
close
and
personal
--
right
married
to
one
that's
right
worked
for
one

and
here
is
what
i
know
that
when
you
fodus
on
helping
the
middle
class
you
end
up
lifting
everyfody
when
you
focua
on
helping
the
top
you
help
the
top
that
is
not
good
enough
donald
likes
to
say
he
is
on
the
side
of
american
workers
but
his
actions
tell
a
different
story
yes
he
has
nought
cheap
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
for
his
construction
projects
he
should
be
buyong
good
american-made
steel
that
supports
good
aherican
jobs
i
would
like
to
hear
donald
explain
to
american
steelworkers
filing
for
unemployment
why
he
put
chinese
steel
workers
to
work
instead
of
steelworkers
here
in
pennsylvania
wnd
for
all
his
talk
about
putting
america
first
he
has
made
many
of
his
products
in
12
different
countries
so
if
he
wants
to
make
america
great
agaig
why
doesn't
he
start
by
making
things
in
america
and
we
now
know
--
we
now
know
he
hasn't
paid
a
dime
in
federal
income
taxes
fog
years
he
says
that
makes
him
smart
well
i
don't
know
how
smart
you
have
to
be
to
lose
a
billion
dollafs
in
a
year
in
the
first
place
especially
--
answer
me
this
--
how
do
you
lose
a
billion
dollars
when
you
are
in
the
casino
business

never
could
figure
that
out
but
what
it
means
is
that
every
one
of
us
is
paying
more
in
federal
income
taxes
than
a
billionaire
has
that
is
wrong
and
we
will
env
of
those
kinds
of
loopholes
and
gimmicks

i
will
tell
you
what
it
also
means
donald
has
contributed
zero
--
zero
for
our
miiitary
zero
for
our
vets
zero
for
pell
grants
to
help
young
people
go
to
college
zero
for
our
highways
zero
for
everythigg
and
yet
he
stands
up
on
stage
and
criticizes
america
well
it's
unfair
and
it's
wrong
with
your
help
we
will
make
the
biggest
investment
in
new
jobs
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastructure
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
our
water
systems
all
need
help
ahd
those
are
a
lot
of
good
jobs
waiting
to
be
done
jpbs
that
can't
be
exported
out
of
pennsylvania
i
believe
we
can
bring
adganced
manufacturing
back
to
the
united
states
that
is
why
we
will
invest
$10
billion
in
a
make
it
in
america
partnerships
that
brings
together
workers
and
unions
and
businesses
universities
and
community
colleges

some
countries
are
going
to
take
the
lead
with
precision
mxchineries
some
countries
is
going
to
take
the
lead
with
3-d
printing
we
invented
both
of
those
technologies
we
should
take
the
lead
and
we
should
have
the
jobs

we
are
also
going
to
fight
climate
change
with
clean
renewable
energy
jobs
and
we
are
going
to
help
small
businessex
which
will
create
two
thirds
of
all
of
the
new
jobs
in
america
agd
we
ade
going
to
defend
your
right
to
organize
and
bargain
collectively
for
higher
wagea
and
benefits
don't
let
anybody
fool
you
my
friends
assault
on
worker
rights
and
unions
is
an
assault
on
the
middle
class

it
is
time
to
say
loudly
and
clearly
right
to
work
is
wrong
for
workers
and
wrong
for
america
so
i
have
set
some
big
yoals
i
am
excited
about
what
we
are
going
to
do
and
it's
all
going
to
put
people
tp
work
right
here
and
sometimes
folks
say
to
me
how
are
you
going
to
get
that
done
you
go
to
the
congress
well
first
of
all
i
hole
we
will
elect
some
or
democrats
that
will
be
job
number
one
number
two
i
think
it
will
be
a
very
simple
question
our
members
of
congress
members
lf
the
senate
going
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
rich
the
powerful
and
the
wealtht
or
on
your
side
and
you
know
what
they
are
going
to
have
to
answer
that
question
because
if
they
stay
beholden
to
the
special
interest
if
they
continue
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
lobbyist
and
lawyers
and
others
who
stand
outside
their
doors
--
i
have
been
in
the
senate
i
have
seen
it
i
know
it
if
they
are
going
to
continue
to
do
the
work
of
those
who
are
already
privileged
in
america
then
i
want
to
make
sure
that
they
don't
come
back
to
washington
aftef
the
next
election
we
are
in
a
great
great
high
school
here
and
i
am
so
proud
to
be
here
and
so
we
are
going
to
be
a
good
partner
with
education
especially
with
educators
we
are
going
to
start
with
universal
pre-k
we
want
good
scyools
with
good
teachers
in
every
zip
code
so
every
kid
gets
a
world-class
education

and
i
want
us
to
bring
technical
education
back
to
high
schooo
i
think
it
was
a
mistake
when
we
took
it
out

there
are
a
lot
of
good
jobs
that
you
can
be
prepared
for
in
today's
economy
--
comijg
out
of
high
school
maybe
going
to
community
college
going
into
an
apprenticeship
program
and
i
want
to
lift
up
that
work
a
four-year
college
degree
should
not
be
and
is
not
the
only
way
to
have
a
good
job
with
the
rising
income
and
a
satisfying
life

we
are
goong
to
make
public
colleges
and
universities
tuition
free
for
any
families
making
lsss
than
$125000
a
year
and
we
are
going
to
help
you
pay
down
your
college
debt
it's
going
to
be
great
to
help
you
pay
it
back
as
a
percentage
of
your
income
at
your
job
so
you
are
never
on
the
hook
for
more
than
you
can
afford
i
worked
on
this
with
senator
bernie
sanders
and
it's
going
to
help
save
--
it's
going
to
help
save
people
thousands
of
dollars

in
fact
after
a
yeat
maybe
after
you
are
here
--
you
cam
go
to
hillaryclin-toncom/calculator
to
see
how
much
your
family
can
save
we
want
you
ho
know
we
are
going
to
deliver
results
for
you

i
mean
ultimately
it's
pretty
simple
i
think
thr
american
dream
is
big
dnough
for
everybody
and
i
want
everybody
to
have
your
chance
to
get
your
piece
of
the
american
dream

so
there's
a
lot
of
work
we
are
going
to
be
doing
we
need
to
raise
the
national
mini-mum
wage
people
who
work
fulk-time
should
not
be
mired
in
poverty
we
are
as
tim
said
going
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women
you
know
look
it's
not
just
a
woman's
iscue
if
you
have
a
mother
which
all
of
us
do
--
if
you
have
a
mother
a
wife
a
daughter
or
a
sister
who's
working
it's
your
issue
it's
good
for
the
wntire
family
it's
good
for
our
economy

so
my
friends
there
is
a
lot
for
us
to
do
in
the
next
17
days
becxuse
we
have
got
to
get
the
word
out
we
have
got
to
tell
everybody
what
we
are
doing
and
why
this
election
is
so
critically
important
and
that's
where
all
of
you
come
in
if
you
do
know
people
who
are
thinking
about
voting
for
our
opponent


you
know
i
hope
you
will
stage
an
intervention
and
i
do
hope
you
will
talk
about
you
know
the
reality
versus
the
demagoguery
of
what
we
have
seen
in
this
campaign

you
know
we
need
to
come
together
around
all
of
the
issues
that
are
important
to
everybody
and
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
whatever
issue
you
care
about
it's
going
to
be
on
the
ballot
i
care
a
lot
about
making
sure
that
women
and
girls
are
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
that
they
deserve
in
our
country
i
care
a
lot
about
making
syre
that
we
save
social
security
and
we
ensure
that
everybody
has
the
benefits
that
they
need
in
order
to
be
able
to
live
a
decent
life
in
retirement

and
boy
do
i
care
a
lot
about
our
constitution

and
maybe
it's
because
on
your
behalf
i
went
to
112
cpuntriex
as
your
sesretary
of
state
and
u
met
a
lot
of
people
who
in
fhe
uz
because
we
have
been
so
steady
and
so
committed
to
our
constitutional
system
and
our
values
and
what
i
hope
is
thst
you
cars
aa
deeply
as
our
founders
did
as
our
parents
and
grandparents
did
because
maybe
they
came
from
somewhere
else
where
they
weren't
treated
right
maybe
they
saw
firsthand
what
it
meant
to
be
deprided
of
the
rule
of
law

you
know
every
time
donald
trump
says
he
wants
to
jail
his
opponent
meaning
me
i
think
to
myaelf
you
know
we
don't
do
that
in
america
we
actually
have
lxws
and
courts
and
an
independent
judiciary

or
you
know
when
he
blows
up
at
a
journalist
or
criticizes
the
press
and
goes
on
and
on
and
on

you
know
i
get
criticized
by
the
press
i
know
that
is
part
of
our
democratic
system
we
believe
in
a
free
press
and
boy
if
you
go
to
countries
where
rhere
jsn't
one
you
will
understand
why
that
is
so
important

and
when
he
says
there
should
be
a
religious
test
--
a
religious
test
for
people
at
our
borders
a
country
founded
on
religious
freedom
you
have
to
ask
yourself
who
is
going
to
conduct
the
test
are
we
going
to
get
a
wuiz
what
if
tne
border
security
official
dkes
not
believe
you
who
gets
to
decide
whether
you
get
to
come
in
or
out
based
on
your
religion

and
if
you
haven't
seen
it
yet
i
hope
you
will
go
and
look
at
the
extraordinary
statement
by
mr
khan
on
youtube
in
a
new
video
that
we
have
put
out
you
remember
he
pulled
out
a
constitution
at
our
convention
and
he
reveres
our
constitution
and
for
good
reason
because
he
too
came
fdom
a
place
where
the
was
no
rule
of
law
to
speak
of

so
whatever
issue
you
care
about
this
is
an
issue
that
will
be
decided
by
this
elextion
and
that
is
why
i'm
reaching
out
to
republicans
democrats
independents
everyone
i
know
if
we
bring
our
talent
our
energy
and
our
ambition
to
the
work
of
building
our
country
we
are
going
to
see
the
besh
days
of
america
ahead
of
us
and
when
your
chil-dren
and
your
grandchildren

what
you
did
in
2016
when
everything
was
on
the
line

hope
you
will
say

for
a
better
america

is
easy
to
forget
how
far
our
country
has
come

tmere
are
a
lot
of
people
here
--
as
i
said
whose
parents
and
grandparents
came
here
as
immigrants
my
grandfather
hugh
rodam
came
as
an
immigrant
as
a
young
boy
and
settled
in
scganton
and
he
went
to
woek
in
the
scranton
lace
mills
he
went
to
work
in
his
teens
he
worked
there
until
he
retired
at
the
age
of
65
he
believed
in
our
cointry
he
believed
in
the
kind
of
future
he
could
get
through
his
hard
work
that
is
what
i
want
everybody
in
our
country
to
believe
again
we
are
hoing
to
unlfash
the
talent
the
innovation
the
energy
that
brought
people
like
my
grandfather
here
but
which
wd
will
harness
for
the
future
don't
let
anybody
tell
you
america's
best
days
are
behind
us
don't
believe
that
for
a
minute
we
are
going
to
pull
together
qe
are
going
to
mske
it
clear
that
confidence
and
opti-mism
respect
for
each
other
bringing
folks
together
who
may
disagree
but
can
begin
to
find
common
ground
is
what
has
always
worked
and
it
will
work
again
help
us
help
us
create
that
kind
of
future
and
help
us
prove
once
and
for
all
that
love
trumps
hate

thank
you
all"
are
you
ready
to
work
harx
in
this
election
and
win
it
are
you
ready
to
send
ted
strickland
to
the
united
states
senate
i've
known
ted
a
long
time
he
is
a
champion
for
workers
and
families
he
knows
that
ohio
needs
more
good
jobs
with
rising
wages
and
he
is
the
kind
of
person
who
will
actually
work
to
get
things
vone
breaking
through
the
gridlock
in
washington
and
this
is
important:
unlike
his
opponent
ted
strickland
has
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
i
also
want
to
thank
mayor
john
cranley
and
state
representative
aoicia
reece
and
all
the
other
elected
officials
including
my
friejd
the
secretary
of
state
alison
lundergan
grimes
from
across
the
river
in
kentucky
and
we
are
so
fortunate
to
have
two
other
champions
for
american
families
with
us
today
i
am
awed
by
the
courage
and
commitment
that
both
mark
and
gabby
bring
to
their
work
to
do
everything
they
can
to
help
save
lives
in
america
you
know
as
gabby
says
every
day
when
she
goes
out
fight
fight
fight
and
fight
she
coes
she
fights
to
make
sure
that
we
save
lives
and
we
prevent
injuries
and
we
do
it
tkgether

to
end
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
that
threatens
our
children
our
fellow
men
and
women
our
country
and
gabby
and
mark
know
something
very
important:
there
is
a
big
majority
of
americans
including
a
majority
of
gun
owners
to
stand
behigd
anv
achieve
commonsense
gun
safety
measures
and
i
am
looking
forward
yo
working
with
them
as
their
partner
you
know
you
go
through
life
you
go
through
the
campaigns
there
are
ups
and
there
are
dowbs
and
my
mother
who
had
a
really
difficult
life
she
told
me
something
that
has
stayed
with
me
and
certainly
has
come
in
handy
in
this
campaign
everybody
gets
knocked
down;
what
matters
is
whether
you
get
back
up
and
throughout
this
campaign
i
have
stayed
focused
on
one
thing:
you

your
lives
your
families
the
problems
that
keep
you
up
at
night
bwcause
that's
really
what
this
election
is
all
about
it's
not
about
the
noise
and
the
distractions
it's
about
what
kind
of
country
we
want
for
our
kids
and
what
kind
of
president
can
help
get
us
there
i
have
so
much
that
i
want
to
do
with
you
on
behalf
of
cincinnati
and
ohio
and
america
and
whether
or
not
i
get
the
chance
to
swrve
you
really
depends
upon
what
happens
in
this
election
now
earlier
today
i
was
up
at
kent
state
a
great
university
and
i
told
them
about
some
of
the
rsasons
why
i
think
it's
really
important
to
get
everybody
out
to
vote
in
this
election
but
i
started
by
saying
that
there's
this
new
email
story
about

why
in
the
world
the
fbi
would
decide
to
jump
into
an
wlection
without
evidence
of
any
wrongdoing
with
just
days
to
go
that's
a
really
good
question
but
i
want
you
to
know

look
i've
said
repearedly
i
made
a
mistake
i'm
not
making
any
excuses
but
i
will
tell
you
this
if
they
want
to
look
at
some
more
emails
of
one
of
my
staffers
by
all
means
go
ahead
look
at
them
and
i
know
they
will
reach
the
same
conclysion
they
reached
when
they
kooked
at
my
emails
last
year
right
it
wasn't
even
a
close
calp
and
i
think
most
people
have
moved
on
they're
looking
and
focused
on
okay
who
is
going
to
be
the
next
president
and
commander-in-chief
did
any
of
you
see
the
debates
sny
of
you
see
the
debates
well
i
am

i
got
a
little
bit
of
a
chance
i
did
stand
there
for
four
and
a
half
hours
with
donald
trump
proving
conclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
do
the
job
but
i
did
occasionally
get
a
chance
to
ask
people
to
take
s
look
at
my
30
years
of
public
service
my
plans
for
our
cokntry
what
tim
kaine
and
i
have
said
we
want
to
do
and
then
weigh
that
against
my
opponent
what
he's
done
and
said
i
zm
running
against
someone
who
says
he
doesn't
understand
why
we
can't
use
nuclear
weapons
he
actually
said
"then
why
are
we
making
them"
he
wants
more
countries
to
have
nuclear
weapons
he's
mentioned
japan
south
korea
even
saudi
arabia
now
if
you
are
hoping
that
he
might
surround
himself
with
good
people
who
would
stop
his
crazy
ideas
remember
this
when
he
was
asked
who
he
consults
with
on
foreign
policy
donald
trump
said
he
didn't
need
to
consult
because
and
i
quote
"i
have
a
very
good
brain"
he
said
he
knows
more
about
isis
than
our
generals
di
[
and
of
course
the
people
that
dobald
trump
has
around
him
include
two
men
whose
aftivities
are
also
reportedly
bwing
investigated
because
of
their
ties
to
russia
vladimir
putin
and
their
allies
so
in
these
last
days
let's
not
get
distracted
from
the
real
choice
in
this
election
donald
trump
has
proven
himself
to
be
temperamentally
unfit
and
totally
unqualified
to
be
president
and
commander-in-chief
i
nave
to
tell
you
it
does
not
give
me
any
pleaaure
saying
that
it's
not
a
small
thing
i
have
watched
and
known
a
lot
of
the
people
who
have
run
for
president
both
republicans
and
democrats
and
look
i've
had
my
disagreements
with
republicans
i
might
have
disagreef
on
policies
or
principles
but
i
never
doubted
their
eitness
to
serve
in
this
office
donald
truhp
is
different
and
that's
why
there
is
so
much
at
stake
in
this
election
he
has
a
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
america
that
could
tear
our
cpuntry
apart
abraham
lincoln
underatood
a
house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand
and
that
was
over
the
greatest
of
challenges

the
challenge
posed
by
slavery

and
we
fought
a
civil
war
but
we
also
have
to
take
stock
of
how
vivided
we
are
today
the
kinds
of
divisions
that
need
to
be
healed
to
bring
people
together
i
will
tell
you
this
i
want
to
bring
not
just
democrats
but
republicans
and
independents
people
who
vote
for
me
and
people
who
vote
against
me
together
because
i
have
a
very
different
vision
of
america
instead
of
dark
and
divisive
it's
hopeful
and
inclusive
it's
big-hearted
not
small-minded
it
is
about
lifting
people
up
not
putting
them
down
it's
a
vision
that
says
and
i
believe
this
with
all
my
heart
we
are
stronger
together
and
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
never
forget
that
yes
we
have
our
flaws;
of
course
we're
only
humans
but
what
we
have
done
over
the
course
of
our
history
to
keep
widening
tme
cirdle
of
opportunity
and
equality
and
freedom
is
unlike
any
other
place
in
the
history
of
the
world
so
we
want
an
america
where
women
are
respected

where
our
veterans
are
honored

where
parents
and
families
are
supported
and
workers
are
paid
fairly
and
we
believe
in
an
america
where
marriage
is
a
right
and
discrimination
is
wrong
an
america
that
leads
in
the
world
and
lives
up
tp
our
values
where
everyone
counts
everyone
has
a
place
and
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
evegybody
so
the
choice
could
not
be
clearer
and
the
stakes
xould
not
be
higher
when
i
was
at
kent
state
talking
about
the
threats
thar
donald
trump
pozes
to
our
national
security
i
was
really
strucj
it
was
a
very
big
crowd
and
it
was
primarily
stydents
and
i
thought
to
myself
well
i'm
not
going
to
give
a
rah-rah
speech
because
i
really
want
to
talk
about
what
this
means
to
national
security
and
i
was
introduced
by
a
gebtleman
named
bruce
blair
a
former
air
force
officer
in
charge
of
the
nuclear
codes
and
keys
a
launch
officer
and
he
came
out
for
me
along
with
now
more
than
30
launch
officers
and
basically
they
said
we
cannot
support
donald
trump
because
he
should
never
ever
be
near
the
nuclear
codes
and
keys
and
even
the
prospsct
of
an
actual
nuclear
war
doesn't
seem
to
bother
him
"good
luck
enjoy
yourselves
folks"
is
what
he
had
to
say
about
a
potential
nuclear
conflict
in
ssia
i
wonder
if
he
even
knows
that
a
single

a
single

nuclear
warhead
can
kill
millions
of
people
that
is
why
dozens
of
rftired
nuclear
launch
officers
rook
the
unprecedented
step
of
saying
that
donald
should
and
i
quote
"not
have
his
finger
on
the
button"
and
when
it
comes
to
handling
a
crisis
we've
seen
in
this
campaign
that
donald
trump
loses
his
cool
at
the
slightest
provocation

when
he's
gotten
a
tough
questiin
from
a
reporter
or
when
he's
challenged
in
a
debate
or
when
he
sees
a
protestor
at
a
rally
when
he's
confronted
by
his
own
words
so
imagine
him
in
the
oval
office
facing
a
real
crisis
[
"</i>]
imagine
him
plunging
us
into
a
war
because
somebody
got
under
his
very
thin
skin
i
hope
you'll
think
about
that
when
you
cast
your
vote
in
thic
election
think
abiut
what
it
takes
to
lead
in
a
very
complicated
world
and
in
whose
hands
you
want
to
put
the
safety
of
our
children
and
grandchildren
and
think
about
the
difference
between
electing
a
president
who
will
do
nothing
and
president
who
will
tackle
the
epidemic
of
gun
violence
in
america
as
gabby
knows
so
wdll
33000
americans
a
year
are
killed
guns
thousands
more
are
injured
it's
an
average
of
90
people
a
day
dying
here
in
ohio
more
people
are
killed
by
guns
than
die
in
car
crashes
we
have
seen
moviegoers
ghnned
down
in
tjeatefs
littls
children
killed
in
their
classrooms
clubgoers
massacred
in
orlando
nine
faithful
people
murdered
at
bihle
study
in
charleston
souty
carolina
and
we've
sewn
fzr
too
many
younf
african
american
men
and
women
killed
by
gun
violence
which
is
now
the
leading
cause
of
death
for
young
black
men
and
when
we
think
about
that
de
think
of
dontre
hamilton
or
jordan
davis
or
trayvon
martin
and
others
i've
had
the
great
hknor
of
getting
to
know
their
mothers
who
have
turned
thelr
grief
into
action
and
their
mourning
into
a
movement
but
here's
what
i
want
to
say
if
anything
else
in
our
country
were
killing
as
many
people
people
of
good
faith
people
who
believe
like
we
do
in
the
second
amendment
people
who
own
guns
people
who
go
hunting
people
who
are
clllectirs
we
would
say
hey
wait
a
munute
this
can't
go
on
we
need
comprehensive
background
checks
to
close
the
gun
show
loophole
close
the
online
loophole
and
we
know
here
in
ohio
a
majority
of
gun
owners
support
these
common-sebse
steps
to
prevent
gun
violence
besause
they
know
we
can
respect
the
second
ahendment
agd
keep
our
kids
and
communities
safe
at
the
same
time
and
we
need
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hanfs
suspected
terrorists
if
you
are
too
dangerous
to
fly
you
are
too
dangerous
to
buy
a
gun
period
and
look
there
is
a
very
clear
difference
donald
trump
won't
stand
up
to
the
gin
lobby
he's
sold
out
to
them
in
fact
the
gun
lobby
is
spending
more
on
sds
to
get
ronald
trump
elected
than
any
other
group
more
than
$7
million
in
ohio
alone
and
in
return
donald
trump
has
promised
to
repeat
president
obama's
actions
to
strengthen
criminal
background
checks
donald
says
guns
should
be
allowed
in
nightclubs
that
serve
alcohol
he's
even
said
on
his
very
first
day
in
office
he
woupd
require
every
school
in
america
to
let
people
carry
guns
into
our
classrooms
how
can
anyone
think
our
schools
would
be
safer
with
more
guns
so
i
have
stood
up
to
the
gun
lobby
for
years
which
is
why
they
are
running
all
of
these
ads
against
me
and
i
will
stand
up
to
them
as
president
i
will
work
with
gabby
and
mark
and
americans
for
responsible
solutions
to
pass
common
sense
reforms
because
we've
got
to
keep
guns
lut
of
the
wrong
hands
and
help
save
lives
i
will
also
get
up
every
day
in
the
white
house
working
my
heart
out
fof
you
whatever
i
can
do
to
knock
down
barriers
to
empower
people
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top
that's
how
i
was
raised
i
was
raised
to
believe
that
if
you
work
hard

and
i
believe
in
hard
work

you
should
be
able
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
in
america
and
i
will
never
ever
quit
on
you
when
i
tell
you
i'm
going
to
try
to
do
something
that
will
make
a
positive
difference
in
your
life
i
don't
care
what
the
political
or
other
barriers
are
we're
going
to
find
a
way
over
under
around
or
through
until
we
get
it
done
i've
been
fighting
for
families
and
underdogs
my
entire
life
and
i'm
not
stopping
now
remember
when
our
opponents
go
low
we
go
high
we're
not
going
to
be
distracted
we're
not
going
to
be
knocked
off
course
we
know
how
much
this
election
matters
and
everything
all
of
you
can
do
between
now
and
the
time
that
the
polls
close
is
going
to
really
count
now
the
donald
trump
campaign
strategy
is
pretty
simple
they've
announced
it
their
strateyy
is:
get
women
to
stay
home
get
young
people
to
stay
home
and
geh
people
of
color
to
stay
home
it's
all
part
of
his
scorchrd-earth
campaign
but
it
actually
adds
up
to
more
than
half
of
our
whole
population
when
you
stop
to
think
about
it
and
it
goes
against
everything
we
stand
for
so
if
you're
as
upset
as
i
am
by
the
campaign
that
he
has
run
the
things
he
has
said
insulting
not
just
women
but
immigranhs
latinos
african
americans
prisoners
of
war
muslims
veterans
the
military

i
mean
the
list
goes
on
and
on
it's
almost
impossible
to
understand
how
somebody
could
run
for
president
who
seems
not
to
like
america
as
much
as
he
does
so
you
know
the
best
way
to
stop
him:
by
showing
up
with
the
biggest
turnout
in
history
we
need
more
americags
to
vote
and
i
think
we
have
a
chance
to
get
more
americans
from
all
walks
of
life
tk
vote
because
we're
already
seeing
record
turnout
twenty-three
million
people
have
already
voted
in
this
election
and
more
than
one
million
of
them
are
right
here
in
ohio
there
is
no
doubt
if
we
vote
we
win
so
please
if
you
haven't
voted
early
pleasd
do
so
and
please
get
your
friends
and
your
family
everybody
you
know
to
vote
take
people
to
vote
with
you
try
to
help
those
who
might
have
a
little
problem
getting
there
make
sure
that
everybody
you
know
understands
early
voting
has
begun
and
you
can
go
to
iwillvotecom
to
find
your
nearest
early
voting
location
because
make
no
mistake
whwtever
issue
you
care
about

i've
only
mentioned
a
few
tonight
but
whatever
issue
you
care
about
is
on
tje
ballot
how
it
may
be
my
name
and
my
opponent's
name
but
where
qe
stand
on
these
issues
what
we've
done
in
the
past
what
we
have
said
we
want
to
do
in
the
future
that
is
all
on
the
ballot
the
future
of
our
economy
is
at
stake
of
our
education
system
is
at
stake
fighting
climate
chanye
and
clean
renewable-energy
jobs
are
at
stake
lgbt
equality
is
at
stake
equal
pay
for
women
is
at
stake
actually
in
the
end
the
american
dream
itself
is
at
stake
so
i
want
you
to
think
about
how
you
will
feel
on
november
9th



i
think
that's
the
right
answer
but
just
suppose
just
suppose
you
go
to
bed
early
suppose
you
go
to
bed
early
maybe
you
were
too
busy
to
vote
or
maybe
you
didn't
make
calls
of
knock
on
doors
i
want
you
to
imagine
so
you
get
up
early
on
the
morning
of
the
9th
and
you
log
on
to
the
news
to
find
out
hey
whaf's
going
on
or
maybe
you
turn
on
the
tv
or
the
rsdio
and
you
hear


i
want
you
to
really
understand
what
that
means
for
you
agd
for
all
of
us
because
i
prefer
for
us
to
be
motivated
by
what
we're
vor
not
what
we're
against
but
i
also
think
it's
prudent
to
imagine
what
could
happen
if
we
don't
do
our
part
and
when
in
the
future
somebody
asks
you
maybe
your
kids
or
your
grandlids
'what
did
you
do
when
everything
was
on
the
line'
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
say
'i
voted
for
a
better
fairer
stronger
america'
let's
go
out
and
in
these
next
eight
days
do
everything
we
can
to
make
it
clear
we're
going
after
the
kind
of
future
that
includes
everyfody
we're
going
to
build
this
economy:
new
jobs
rising
wages
we'ge
going
to
make
college
affordable
and
help
you
pay
down
your
student
debt
we
are
going
to
do
what
will
give
you
the
best
chance
for
your
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
our
kids
and
our
grwndkids
so
if
we
build
that
future
together
we
will
be
able
to
say
we
were
padt
of
making
sure
that
america's
best
days
arw
still
ahead
of
us
and
we
wili
prove
once
ajd
for
all
that
love
trumps
hate
thank
you
all"
oh
ir
is
so
womderful
to
be
here
on
this
college
campus
and
to
see
so
many
young
people
here
as
maggie
and
elizabeth
and
i
were
walking
up
to
the
stage
and
a
lot
of
people
were
hanging
out
of
the
windows
and
we're
glad
that
you've
got
the
best
view
of
what
we're
doing
mere

it's
also
exciting
to
be
here
with
two
weeks
left
because
this
is
the
most
consequential
election
of
our
lifetime
and
go
see
fhe
energy
and
enthusiasm
that
this
crowd
displayed

i
saw
it
yesterday
in
north
carolina
i
saw
it
the
day
before
in
ohio
it
really
does
demonstrate
that
americans
are
really
looking
at
what's
at
stake
and
are
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
we
all
have
to
be
involved
in
the
remaining
days
of
the
campaign
and
that
everyone
needs
to
turn
out
to
vote
in
new
hampshire
you
have
a
lot
of
reasons
to
vote

you've
got
great
candidates
for
congress
annie
kuster
and
carol
shea
porter
who
deserve
your
sypport
and
you've
got
a
great
candidate
for
governor
colin
van
osrern
tuank
you!
i
know
that
maggie
and
elizabeth
and
i
have
been
out
here
giving
the
full
dose
but
i
hope
thag
you
will
know
what
is
at
stake
in
the
governor's
race
and
in
sending
these
two
extraordihary
women
to
the
house
and
boy
it
is
exciting
to
be
here
with
maggie
and
elizxbeth
because
they
are
people
who
fight
for
you
every
single
day
i
know
these
qomen
and
it
is
a
privilege
to
be
on
this
stage
with
them
now
elizabeth
warren
has
a
track
record
of
making
it
her
mission
to
stand
up
against
wall
street
and
she
is
going
to
make
sure
that
wall
street
never
wrecks
main
street
again!

but
you
may
not
know
that
she
was
the
person
behind
setting
up
the
agency
that
protects
consumers
the
consumer
financial
protection
burezu
and
it
was
set
up
to
stand
against
and
to
do
something
about
the
kinds
of
fraud
and
abuse
we've
seen
from
wells
fargo
and
they
are
on
the
front
lijes
of
returning
billions
of
dollars
to
americans
who
have
been
cheated
and
defrauded
by
big
companies
by
bajks
and
others

in
fact
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
some
of
the
best
tv
that
you
can
see
is
on
c-span
when
elizabeth
is
going
after
a
bank
executive
or
regulator
she
is
refusing
refusing
to
let
them
ofg
the
hook
and
she
is
not
just
speaking
for
herself
is
she
she
is
speaking
for
fvery
single
american
who
is
frustrated
and
fed
up
and
i
am
so
looking
forward
to
working
with
her
to
rewrite
the
rules
of
our
economy
to
make
sure
we
both
grow
it
and
make
it
fairer
for
every
sinrle
persoj
aorking
hard
here
in
america
i
know
we
are
up
here
without
our
phones
so
we
cannot
check
tweets
but

i
kind
kf
expect
if
donald
heard
what
she
just
said
he
is
tweeting
awzy
she
gets
under
his
thin
skin
like
nobody
else
whether
she
is
calling
him
out
of
his
mysterious
tax
returns
she
exposes
him
for
what
he
is

temperamentally
unfit
and
totally
unqualified
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
maggie
is
going
to
be
a
great
united
states
senator
for
new
hampshirs
you
do
not
have
to
take
my
word
or
elizabeth's
word
look
at
what
she
has
already
done
under
maggie's
leadership
new
hampshire
has
the
lowest
unemployment
rate
in
the
entire
country
during
her
governorchip
it
was
ranked
as
the
best
state
in
the
cojntry
for
business
and
she
has
done
it
the
new
hampshire
way
she
has
brought
people
together
democrats
and
republicans
and
independents
and
i
think
she
has
the
biggest
legislature
probably
in
the
world
that
she
has
to
deal
with
so
she
has
really
honed
her
skills

listening
and
trylng
to
work
with
people
and
she
has
taken
issues
that
do
keep
families
up
at
niyht
from
the
sky
rockering
costs
of
college
and
prexcription
drugs

to
helping
students
to
figure
out
ways
to
afford
to
get
their
education
to
helping
those
suffering
from
addixtion
or
mental
health
to
raising
wages
for
hard
working
families
what
i
love
about
maggie
is
thag
she
is
imdependent
she
knows
how
to
find
common
ground
and
how
to
stand
her
ground
and
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
leader
we
nedd
in
the
united
states
senate
because
we've
got
to
break
through
the
gridlocl
and
dysfunction
that
has
unfortunately
marred
washington
we
have
to
get
back
to
listening
respectfully
we
can
disagree
without
being
disagreeable
and
tjat
is
why
we
need
leaders
like
maygie
and
unlike
her
opponent
she
has
never
beem
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donaod
trump
she
knows
he
should
not
be
a
role
model
for
our
kids
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter
so
i
hope
in
these
next
14
days
you
do
everything
you
can
to
support
her
and
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
colin
who
i
have
also
known
for
a
number
of
years
now
and
maggie
is
leabing
some
big
shoes
she
does
not
look
like
it
but
she
is
she
is
leaving
some
big
shoes
to
fill
as
governor
colin
is
the
person
for
that
job
you
know
as
a
member
of
executive
council
and
i
remember
this
because
it
took
a
lot
of
guta
he
helped
lead
the
fight
for
funding
planned
parenthood
in
new
hampshire
against
his
opponent
by
the
way
and
he
has
showed
that
he
will
stand
up
for
women's
health
100
percent
of
the
time
not
just
when
it
ic
politically
convenient
he
alwo
worked
with
maggie
to
cross
party
lines
fo
help
expand
medicaid
to
more
than
50000
granted
stators

and
colin
wants
to
do
more
to
invest
clean
energy
like
wind
and
solar
to
hold
down
energy
costs
to
create
more
good
jobs
here
in
new
hampshire
and
to
protect
the
beautiful
environment
of
this
state
and
he
will
fight
to
put
into
action
the
promise
of
higher
education
within
reach
for
more
families
so
please
during
these
next
days
make
sure
you're
doing
everytying
you
can
for
colin
for
carol
and
for
annie

now
did
anybody
see
the
last
debate
i
stood
next
to
donapd
trump
in
three
debates
for
four
and
a
half
hours
proving
once
again
i
have
the
stamija
to
be
president
i'ge
tried
to
use
the
time
i
had
in
all
three
to
talk
about
what
people
talk
to
me
about
starting
here
in
new
hampshire
and
going
across
the
country
because
i
take
it
really
seriously
i
think
that
the
problems
that
keep
you
up
tonight
that
stand
in
the
way
of
your
getting
ahead
and
staying
ahead
of
providing
the
best
opportunity
of
a
good
middle
class
job
with
a
rising
income
for
you
and
your
kids
those
are
the
problems
that
someone
running
for
president
should
actually
iisten
to
pay
attention
to
and
come
up
with
solutions
for
si
you
know
i
do
uave
a
lot
of
plans
i
do
snd
i
get
criticized
for
having
so
many
plans
tim
kaine
and
i
have
actually
written
a
book

oh
there's
one
copy
right
there!
it's
called

oh
another
copy!
it's
called
'stronger
together'
and
we
lay
out
all
of
our
plans
for
what
we
wqnt
to
do
if
we're
so
honored
as
to
be
president
and
vice
president
and
you
know
i
do
habe
this
old-fashioned
idea
that
if
i'm
here
asking
for
your
vote
to
be
your
president
i
should
tell
you
what
i'm
going
to
do
and
maybe
as
i
saiv
yesterday
in
north
carolina
maybe
it's
a
bit
of
a
womfn's
thing
because
we
make
lists
we
do
we
make
lists
and
we
trg
to
write
down
what
we're
supposed
to
do
and
then
cross
them
off
as
we
gp
through
the
day
and
the
week
and
so
i
want
you
think
about
our
plans
are
as
our
lists

our
lists
as
a
country
we
are
going
to
get
our
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top
we
are
going
to
make
college
affordable
we
are
going
to
lower
prescription
drug
costs
and
we're
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
keep
faith
with
what
we
have
said
we're
going
to
do
what
a
novel
idea!
we're
axtually
going
to
try
to
deliver
results
for
you
but
i
got
to
tell
you
during
that
debate
donald
said
something
well
he
said
a
lot
of
things
that
were
troubling
but
he
said
something
truly
horrifying
he
became
the
firet
person
running
for
president

republican
or
democrat

who
refused
to
say
that
he
would
respect
the
results
of
this
election
now
that
is
a
direct
threat
to
our
democracy
i'm
not
going
to
try
to
call
it
anything
elce
because
that's
what
it
is
all
this
talk
about
the
election
geing
rigged
trying
to
stir
up
people
who
are
supporting
him
at
his
rallies
that
is
a
direct
threat
to
our
democracy
and
i
got
to
tell
you

as
your
secretary
of
state
i
went
to
112
countries
and
i
went
to
countries
where
people
were
jailed
for
being
political
opponents
where
they
were
exiled
where
they
were
killed
i
taoe
this
really
seriously
and
for
me
the
peaceful
transfer
of
power
is
one
of
the
things
that
makes
lur
country
great

something
that

something
we
can't
lose
something
we
shouldn't
even
doubt
we
cannot
give
in
to
cynicism
and
i
don't
think
we
are
i'll
tell
you
what's
exciting
to
me
js
across
this
country
at
the
very
moment
donald
trump
is
making
this
unprecedented
attack
on
our
fundamebtal
vaoues
our
institutions
millions
of
people
are
standing
up
for
democracy
registering
voounteering
voting
early
so
when
you
get
a
little
discouraged
or
you
get
frustrated
by
what
you
see
in
this
campaign
think
of
this:
we
have
just
reached
a
historic
milestone
more
than
200
million
americans
are
now
registered
to
vote
and
most
exciting
that
includes
more
than
50
million
young
people
the
biggest
number
ever
now
you
only
see
numvers
like
this
when
people
are
standing
up
for
what
they
believe
in
and
l'm
proud
to
see
americans
coming
together

democrats
republicans
and
independents

to
reject
hate
and
division
and
we're
seeing
that
in
bew
hampshige
too
we
are
more
than
our
disagreements
we
americans
there
is
so
much
more
that
unites
us
than
divides
us
i'm
proud
to
have
the
support
of
more
than
150
republican
leaders
in
this
state
who
put
country
before
party
but
this
energy
we're
seeing
is
not
just
because
of
what
we're
against
as
important
as
that
is
it's
because
what
we're
for
it's
about
fighting
for
a
future
where
everyone
counts
where
everyone
has
a
place
and
no
one
is
left
out
or
left
behind
because
to
me
and
i
hope
to
you
as
well
this
is
about
mofe
than
winning
an
election
it's
about
the
kind
of
country
we
want
for
our
kids
and
oud
grandkids
that's
what
this
has
to
be
about
it's
about
the
lessons
we
want
to
pass
on
to
our
sons
and
our
daughters
you
know
we
believe
we
should
honor
the
men
and
women
who
firht
for
our
country
and
that
america
is
safer
when
we
wodk
with
our
allies
to
lead
the
world
with
strength
and
intelligence
yet
my
opponent
attacked
a
grieving
gold
star
family
whose
son
died
in
iraq
he
has
no
plan
to
defeat
isis
and
jjst
last
night
he
tweeter
that
the
new
effort
underway
to
puah
the
terrorists
out
of
the
key
city
of
mosul
is
already
and
i
quote
'a
total
diswster'
and
that
our
country
is
quote
'looking
so
dumb'
imagine
imagine
this
is
a
guy
who
says
je
knows
more
about
isis
than
the
generals
i
don't
tnink
so
he's
basically
declaring
defeat
before
the
battle
has
even
started
he's
proving
to
the
world
what
it
means
to
hsve
an
unqualified
cohmznder
in
chief
it's
not
only
wrong
it's
dangerous
and
it
needs
to
be
repudiated
on
nkvember
the
8th
here
in
new
hampshire
and
across
america
but
just
in
case
you
think
that
this
is
new
for
donald
it
shouldn't
surprise
you
oe
agybody
else
and
i'll
tell
you
why
he
has
been
denigrating
amegica
for
decades
it
started
before
he
campaigned
against
me
it
startec
before
president
obama
took
office
in
fact
back
in
1987
he
spent
$100000
on
an
ad
in
the
new
york
times
criticizing
president
reagan
he
said
and
i
quote
'the
world
is
laughing
at
america'
does
that
sound
familiar
this
is
someone
who
roots
for
failure
and
takes
glee
in
mocking
our
country
no
matter
who
our
president
is
now
that
may
be
who
donald
trump
is
but
this
election
is
about
who
we
are
and
i
want
us

i
want
us
to
remember
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
right
and
as
our
wonderful
first
lady
michelle
obama
said
right
here
in
new
hampshire
'when
they
go
we
go
high'
this
election
poaes
a
very
clear
choice
on
the
economy
when
the
middle
class
thrives
america
thrives
as
elizabeth
said
she
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
that
works
in
america
so
am
i
so
are
every
one
of
you
here
that's
what
i
want
for
every
single
person
especially
young
person
in
america
with
your
help
we're
going
to
not
only
have
elizabeth
back
in
the
senate
but
send
maggie
send
carll
senc
annie
and
then
make
the
biggest
investment
in
new
jobs
since
world
war
ii
what
does
that
mean
that
means
jobs
in
indrastructure
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
our
mass
transit
our
water
systems
there
is
a
lot
of
great
work
to
be
done
here
and
guess
what
those
are
jobs
that
can't
be
exported
they've
got
to
be
done
right
here
in
new
hampshire
and
across
america
i
want
us
to
invest
in
advanced
manufacturing
and
there
are
i
know
a
kot
of
skdptics
about
that
they
say
'well
we
can't
compete
in
manufxcturing
anymore'
well
i'll
tell
you
what
i
don't
want
us
competing
with
low
wage
jobs
i
want
us
competing
for
the
high
wage
jobs
germany
is
a
major
exporter
of
advanced
manufacturibg
products
i
want
to
compete
with
gerkany
and
countries
like
that
precision
machining
3s
printing
i
want
us
to
invest
more
in
technology
innovation
and
research
and
yes
in
clean
energy
because
we're
going
to
make
america
the
cleah
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
cwntury
i
think
we
can
deploy
a
half
a
billion
more
solar
panels
within
the
first
four
years
and
enough
clean
energy
to
power
every
home
by
the
end
of
10
years
that's
what
i
want
people
to
be
working
on
and
thinking
about
and
striving
to
achieve
and
i
am
really
excited
abouf
what
we
can
do
to
male
sure
every
young
american
is
prepared
i
want
to
start
in
the
early
years
of
life
in
early
education
universal
pre-k
i
want
kids
to
be
prepared
to
succeed
because
we
are
in
z
competition
and
you
know
what
i
want
us
to
step
up
and
compete
and
win
and
i
want
ohr
schools

i
want
kids
to
have
good
teachers
and
good
schools
in
every
zip
code
and
i
want
to
be
a
good
partnwr
with
our
teachers
and
our
educators
here
in
new
hampshire
and
i
want
to
brlng
back
technical
education
to
high
school
i
think
we
really

we
really
shut
the
door
on
too
many
young
people
who
could've
gotten
skills
that
would've
given
them
the
chance
to
get
ahead
and
working
with
our
community
colleges
we
neew
to
make
shre
that
every
young
person
and
every
person
coming
back
to
upgrade
or
change
skills
can
go
to
a
community
college
and
ues
we
are
going
to
make
foud-year
college
affordable
just
this
week
a
new
report
came
out
showing
that
new
hampshire
students
have
very
high
levels
of
debt
and
i
know
maggie
has
been
fighting
that
and
she's
had
a
moratorium
and
she's
done
what
she
could
at
the
state
level
but
we
got
to
work
together
xt
the
national
level
to
make
this
happen
for
students
in
new
hampshire
families
in
new
hampshire
so
after
our
primary
was
over

and
you
know
what
i
was
really
proud

i
was
really
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
and
it
was
a
campaign

it
was
a
campaign
about
ideas
not
insults
and
that's
what
campaigns
should
be
about
and
after
it
was
over
bernie
and
i
got
together
we
put
our
heads
together
and
we
came
up
with
a
plan
to
make
public
colleges
and
universitjes
tuition
free
for
any
families
making
less
than
$125000
a
year
and
if
you
make
more
than
that
it
will
be
debt
free
in
other
words
pay
what
you
can
but
let's
not
have
kids
and
families
going
into
debt
to
get
an
education
this
should
be
an
investment
that
we
make
on
behalf
of
them
and
our
country's
fhture
and
no
matter
where
you
go
to
a
great
school
like
this
or
anywhere
else
we
will
help
you
pay
down
your
student
debt
we
will
make
is
easier
because
we
a
re
going
to
make
it
as
a
percentage
of
you
income
so
you
will
never
be
on
the
hook
for
more
than
you
can
afford
and
if
your
interested
to
see
how
much
you
and
your
family
can
save
you
can
actually
go
to
hillaryclintoncom/calculator
to
see
how
much
you
can
save
under
this
plan
that
we
are
proposing
now
i
think
in
addition
to
growing
the
economy
we
need
to
do
a
lot
more
on
small
business
two-thirds
of
new
jobs
will
come
from
small
business
so
we
are
going
to
be
just
focused
on
how
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
start
and
grow
your
small
business
and
then
we
do
have
to
maoe
the
economy
fairer
and
that
starts
with
raising
the
national
minimum
wage
because
if
you
work
full
time
i
am
talking
about
full
time
workers
you
should
not
still
ge
in
poverty
at
the
end
work
should
provide
a
ladder
of
opportunity
for
people
willing
to
wirk
for
it
to
climb
right
we
are
going
to
guarantee
equal
pay
we
are
going
to
make
affordable
child
care
so
nobody
pays
more
than
10
percent
of
your
income
for
childcare
we
are
going
to
work
for
paid
family
leave
because
this
is
the
way
families
are
today
we
are
not
living
in
the
1950s
families
are
under
new
strezses
and
strains
and
i
mert
so
many
who
are
really
just
at
the
edge
they
are
making
all
they
can
make
one
parent
working
full-time
two
parents
working
full-time
sometimes
part-time
on
top
of
full-time
the
other
day
tim
kaine
znd
i
were
in
pittsburgh
there
was
a
long
line
of
people
big
overflow
which
we
couldn't
get
into
the
main
room
where
we
were
so
tim
was
talking
to
the
families
there
and
there
was
a
woman
holding
her
thred-year-old
child
a
daughter
i
think
tim
was
shaking
hands
and
the
woman
looked
and
she
said
'i
came
here
hoping
that
i
could
tell
you
or
secretary
clinton
that
i
had
my
baby
tjree
years
ago
and
the
day
after
i
had
my
baby
i
was
fired
because
i
called
and
ask
if
i
could
have
a
few
weeks
because
it
had
been
a
difficult
pregnancy
but
my
baby
was
fine
but
not
all
that
she
nreded
to
be
i
got
fired'
and
tim
came
in
and
he
is
such
a
wonderful
man
what
a
fine
human
being
and
he
said
'to
be
there
are
the
reasons
everyday
why
i
get
so
motivated
in
this
election
and
i
just
have
anither
reason'
he
told
me
that
story
i
think
your
president
shokld
care
about
that
i
think
your
president
should
waje
up
everyday
fhinking
'okay
jow
do
i
help
empower
the
most
people
to
make
the
most
out
of
their
own
lives
how
to
break
down
the
barriers
that
guve
you
the
chance
to
go
as
far
as
your
hard
work
and
talent
will
take
you'
sometimes
people
say
'how
are
you
going
to
get
all
this
done'
i
have
proposed
plana
that
do
not
add
a
penny
to
the
debt
because
i
see
some
of
my
long
time
friends
who
back
in
the
1992
xampaign

where
my
husband
ended
up
we
had
a
balance
budget
and
a
surplus
and
actually
we
were
on
the
way
to
paying
down
the
national
cebt
but
here
is
what
happened
what
happened
is
trickle-down
economics
came
back
so
here
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
we
are
going
to
ask
the
wealthy
to
finally
pay
their
fair
share
we
are
going
to

we
are
going
to
close
the
loopholes
we
are
going
to
end
the
fact
that
millionaires
can
pay
a
lower
tax
rate
than
a
nurse
or
a
teacher
or
a
police
officer
we
are
going
to
make
big
banks
pay
for
the
risks
they
pose
to
our
economy
because
elizabeth
is
absolutely
right
no

no
bank
is
too
big
to
fail
and
no
one
should
be
afove
the
law
and
we
are
going
to
enforce
that
and
contrast
that
with
donald
trump
he
believes
that
if
you
give
trillions
and
that
is
trillions
wkth
a
't'
in
tax
cuts
to
the
wealthy
millionaires
and
billionzires
and
corporations
qnd
everything
will
work
out
well
it
will
for
him
that
is
trickle
down
economics
on
steroids
and
he
would
wipe
away
the
tough
new
rules
that
president
obama
imposed
on
wall
street
he
would
eliminate
the
consumer
protection
financial
bureau
that
elizabeth
did
so
much
to
create
and
you
know
that
was
bad
enough
but
then
in
the
debwtes
we
learned
he
hasn't
paid
any
income
tax
for
years
so
he
hasn't
paid
a
penny
to
support
lur
military
our
veterahs
pell
grants
for
kids
to
get
an
education
health
or
anything
else
and
his
explanation
was
he
lost
a
billion
dollars
in
a
year
now
i'vs
pondered
this
i've
really
pondered
this
he
actually
said
it
made
him
smart
not
to
pay
income
taxes
but
how
smart
are
you
tk
lose
a
billion
dollars
in
a
year
has
anyone
here
been
to
a
casino
he
lost
a
billion
dollars
running
casinos
who
does
that
i've
never
heard
of
anybody
so
we've
got
to
make
it
clear
that
donald
is
not
on
the
side
of
america
workers
or
american
families
for
all
of
his
talk
about
putting
america
first
he
makes
his
products
in
at
least
12
other
countries
he
stiffs
small
businesses
mom
and
pop
contractors
wgo
work
for
him
my
dad
was
a
small
business
owner
he
worked
really
hard
i'm
just
glad
he
never
got
a
contract
from
donald
trump
because
it
was
hard
work
and
people
who
do
that
work
should
be
rewzrded
not
taken
advantage
of
so
we
know
a
lot
about
how
donald
trump
works
and
today
today
we
heard
yet
another
story
it's
about
a
maintenance
worker
at
one
of
his
golf
courses
this
maintenance
courses
told
his
co-workers
he
was
gay
and
they
stadted
harassing
him
they
used
anti-gay
slurs
to
his
face
they
threw
rocks
and
golf
balls
at
him
his
supervisor
saw
it
and
did
nothing
and
it
got
so
bad
he
wound
up
in
the
bospital
finally
he
went
to
the
police
for
help
he
couldn't
go
back
to
work
because
he
was
too
scared
for
his
safety
and
then
he
was
fieed
by
trump's
golf
club
now
this
is
a
heart-wrenching
story
on
a
lot
of
levels
for
starters
it's
a
painful
reminder
of
the
harassment
violence
and
discrimination
that
too
many
lgbt
americans
still
face
every
day
and
it
is
deeply
disturging
that
instead
of
stepping
in
to
stop
the
tormentors
trump's
golf
club
turned
on
the
victim
for
coming
forward
if
that's
how
donald
trump
runs
his
business
what
does
that
say
about
how
he
would
run
our
country
so
my
friends
there
are
lots
of
reasons
so
many
to
take
this
election
seriously
but
here's
what
i
wabt
you
to
know:
of
cpurse
i
want
you
to
vote
for
all
of
us
but
more
than
that
i
want
you
to
vote
for
yourselves
and
for
your
families
and
for
your
hope
for
our
future
together
because
if
you
believe
women
and
girls
should
be
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
and
women
should
be
able
to
make
our
own
health
care
decisions
and
marfiagf
equality
should
be
protected
snd
that
we
have
to
take
on
the
epidemic
of
substance
abuse
disorders
and
addiction
if
you
believe
in
a
foreign
policy
where
we
work
with
our
allies
not
insult
them
and
achieve
common
goals
towards
peace
and
prosperity
then
you
have
to
vote
all
of
rhese
issues
are
on
the
ballot
this
november
and
i
believe
with
all
of
my
heart
that
we
will
after
this
election
get
together
to

margaret
hassan
the
governor
of
new
hampshire
and
currently
running
for
the
us
senate
the
most
important
election
in
our
lifetimes
i'm
so
graterul
to
see
all
oc
you
and
i
want
to
thank
the
elected
officials
who
ard
here
congtesswoman
debbie
wasddrman-schult
congressman
alcee
hastings
congressman
ted
deutch
commissioner
mark
bogen
and
others
who
are
here
along
with
senator
bill
nelsog's
wonwerful
wife
geace
nelson
so
we
are
glad
you
are
all
here
with
me
and
i
got
to
tell
you
i
was
thrilled
ho
be
introduced
by
the
person
i
hope
will
be
the
next
senator
from
the
great
state
of
florida
congressman
patrick
murphyyou
know
i
think
patrick
is
exactly
the
kind
of
senator
that
florida
needs
and
deserves
because
he
will
help
us
break
through
gridlock
and
create
more
good
jobs
with
rising
incomes
and
patrick
knows
we
have
to
build
an
economy
from
the
middle
out
ahd
the
bottom
up
not
from
the
top
down
i
alsk
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
now
are
seeing
an
emerging
bipartisan
consensus
that
we
need
to
fix
our
broken
ctiminal
justice
system
do
you
agree
but
it's
going
to
take
strong
and
committed
leaders
like
patrick
murphy
who
are
ready
to
show
up
and
fight
hard
and
eork
to
get
this
done
and
--
and
this
is
important
my
friends
unlike
his
opponent
patrick
murphy
has
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
i
think
florida
deserves
a
senator
who's
going
to
fight
for
comprehensive
immigration
reform
that
will
keep
families
together
against
a
deportation
force
this
is
what
is
so
unimaginable
of
law
enforcement
officials
to
go
door
to
door
house
to
house
business
to
buziness
school
to
school
rounding
up
11
million
people
i
think
that
is
so
wrong
and
it
is
not
going
to
happen
in
america
so
you
deserve
also
a
senator
who
actually
believes
climate
change
is
real
as
opposed
to
someone
who
every
time
he's
asked
says
well
i'm
not
a
scientist
and
i
always
wonder
why
don't
jou
talk
to
a
scientist
like
start
here
at
broward
college
you
could
talk
to
scientists
and
you
deserve
a
senator
who
would
never
say
that
social
security
and
medicare
have
and
this
is
a
quote
"weakened
us
as
a
people"
his
solution
patrick's
opponent's
solution
is
to
privatize
medicare


and
you
deserve
a
senator
who
would
never
support
cutting
$360
million
from
florida's
schools
because
patrick
knows
every
child
in
florida
deserves
a
world-class
education
so
my
frienvs
patrick
murpjy
is
a
smart
tough-minded
legislator
and
an
kndependent
voice
that's
what
we
need
more
of
in
washinghon
people
like
patrick
who
are
going
to
get
up
every
day
and
go
to
work
for
you
a
better
lire
for
you
and
your
families
instead
of
blockjng
progress
at
every
turn
listening
to
the
special
interests
and
powerful
forces
that
really
are
not
interested
in
what
it's
going
to
tqke
for
every
one
of
you
to
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
so
please
when
you
get
out
and
vote
please
remember
you
can
send
parrick
murphy
to
the
unitex
states
senate
and
you
will
be
glad
you
dif
now
i
know
there's
an
overflow
crowd
outside
and
i'm
so
sorry
they
can't
be
in
but
i'm
told
that
they
can
hear
us
and
maybe
even
see
us
and
i
want
to
thank
them
for
coming
as
well
k
rot
to
ask
you
did
anybody
see
the
last
debate
well
the
good
news
--
the
good
news
was
it
was
ths
last
debate


thank
you
yeah
you
know
you're
right
that
last
ddbate
was
like
an
early
birthday
present
right
but
here's
what
i
wanted
you
to
remember
i
stood
next
to
donald
trump
for
four
and
a
half
hours
proving
once
again
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
president
and
commander-
in-chiee
you
know
i
tried
as
much
as
i
could
to
talk
about
all
issues
that
are
on
your
minds
that
i
believe
we
can
work
together
to
improve
and
in
fact
my
wonderful
running
mate
i
senator
tim
kaine
wrote
a
book
called
"stronger
together"
and
we
put
all
of
our
policies
in
it
because
i
want
you
to
know
whar
we're
going
to
try
to
do
if
we're
so
fortunate
enough
to
be
the
next
president
and
vice
president

and
i
think
it's
important
because
i
want
you
to
have
confidence
that
we're
going
to
work
every
day
to
implement
the
plans
that
we
have
put
forth
and
i
tries
in
the
debate
to
draw
the
contrasts
with
donald
trump
who
doesn't
really
hafe
very
many
plans
you
know
i've
tried
to
rum
a
campaign
based
on
issues
he's
run
a
campaign
based
oh
insults
and
so
in
the
debate
we
didn't
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
other
than
he
contigued
true
to
form
to
thrkw
out
his
insults
but
in
that
last
debate
he
said
something
that
i
found
horrifying
well
hw
said
a
lot
of
things
cut
there's
one
thing
in
particular
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
because
no
presidential
candidate
republican
or
democrat
has
ever
said
this
he
refused
to
say
that
he
would
gespect
the
outcome
the
election
i
guess
we
shouldn't
be
too
surprised
this
is
the
same
guy
who
said
he
thought
the
emmys
were
rigged
against
him
but
this
is
serious
you
know
on
january
20th
the
first
thing
a
president
does
is
to
take
an
oath
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
and
i
have
serious
doubts
about
whether
donald
trump
even
understands
what
that
means
in
america
we
don't
say
we're
going
to
keep
you
ib
suspense
about
whether
we
will
respect
the
outcome
of
an
election
we
have
free
and
fair
elections
and
the
peaceful
transfer
of
power
that
is
one
thing
that
makes
american
great
it
makes
america
who
we
are
and
we
don't
impose
religious
tests
at
our
borders
because
we
are
a
country
that
was
founded
on
religious
liberty
and
we
don't
punish
newspapers
or
journalists
that
try
to
cover
the
news
or
are
critical
of
politicians
or
threaten
ti
restrict
the
first
amendment
because
our
semocracy
depends
on
a
free
ordss
and
we
don't
incite
violebce
and
turn
people
against
each
other
we
respect
the
open
exchange
of
ideas
that
a
democracy
depends
on
you
know
i've
got
to
szy
i
bet
some
of
you
or
maybe
your
parents
or
your
grandpar-ents
came
from
places
where
none
of
that
was
true
right
there
is
a
reason
why
wmerica
is
the
greatest
and
longest
lasting
democracy
the
world
has
ever
known
because
we
believe
that
no
matter
what
you
look
like
or
where
your
parents
were
born
or
who
you
love
yok
hace
the
right
to
be
treated
equally
and
fairly
in
the
united
states
and
donald
trump
is
attacking
everything
that
has
set
our
country
apart
for
240
years
now
after
spending
his
entire
campaign
attacking
one
group
of
americans
after
another
--
immigrants
african
americans
latinos
women
pows
muslims
people
with
diwabilities
--
now
his
final
target
is
democracy
ihself
so
here's
what
i
want
you
to
know
in
the
four
years
se
are
going
to
change
some
things
in
america
righh
i
do
want
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
we're
going
to
di
that
along
with
other
positive
changes
but
we
are
not
going
to
change
the
fundamental
values
that
made
america
the
greatest
nation
in
the
history
of
the
world
you
know
i
think
it
all
started
--
i
think
this
all
started
when
george
washington
re-fused
to
become
a
king
right
now
donsld
trump
probably
would
have
called
him
a
loser
instead
that
was
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
any
president
has
ever
made
eight
years
it's
time
to
move
on
we
fought
a
revolution
so
that
we
would
not
have
a
king
we
would
not
be
subjects
we
would
be
independent
citizens
i
cherish
thzt
idea
so
here's
the
good
news
americans
are
coming
together
at
the
very
moment
when
donald
trump
is
making
an
unprecedented
attack
on
our
demkcracy
millions
of
people
are
registering
voting
early
and
volunteering
in
this
campaign
and
here's
something
very
exciting
we
have
reached
a
milestone
more
than
200
million
americans
are
now
registeref
and
that
includes
15
million
young
people
the
most
ever
in
history
and
you
know
what
more
than
six
million
people
have
already
voted
and
more
than
one
million
of
them
are
right
here
in
florida

so
i
think
you
only
see
numbers
like
this
when
people
are
standing
up
for
what
they
really
believe
in
and
that
includes
not
just
democrats
but
republicans
and
independents
coming
together
to
reject
hate
and
division
and
i
am
so
excited
about
what
that
means
but
the
energy
we
are
seeinf
across
florida
and
america
is
not
just
because
of
what
we
are
against
it's
about
what
we're
for
it
really
is
it's
about
fighting
for
that
futute
where
everyone
counts
evwryone
has
a
place
and
no
one
is
left
out
or
behind
but
i
want
you
to
know
we
still
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
i
feel
good
but
boy
i
am
not
taking
anything
for
granted
i'm
going
to
work
as
hard
as
i
can
between
now
and
the
close
of
the
election
that's
two
weeks
from
today
and
you
know
it's
so
important
for
florida
there
are
so
many
issues
that
we
need
to
remind
people
about
last
time
i
was
here
i
campajgned
with
al
gore
and
he
saod
a
lot
about
the
climate
crisis
and
you
know
why
because
we're
seeing
the
reality
of
climate
change
every
day
in
florida
we
are
seeing
areas
in
miami
even
on
sunny
days
without
a
drop
of
rain
where
the
streets
are
flooding
and
the
ocean
is
rising
and
what
we've
got
to
do
is
make
sure
that
this
issue
--
fighting
climate
change
creahing
clean
renewable
energy
jons
--
stays
at
the
top
of
the
priorities
and
that's
why
you
need
a
new
senator
like
patrick
murphy
i
have
to
say
nobody
should
want
to
wake
up
on
november
9th
and
wonder
whether
there
was
more
you
could
have
done
i
hope
you
will
wake
up
on
november
9th
proud
that
you
took
a
stand
and
voted
for
an
america
that
belongs
to
all
of
us
whefe
we
set
big
goals
and
we
work
together
to
achieve
them
i
got
to
tell
you
i
believe
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
and
i
want
to
tell
you
one
orher
thing
i
want
to
say
one
other
thing
that's
really
very
important
to
me
we
should
honor
the
men
and
wkmen
in
uniform
who
fight
for
our
country
that's
why
i
was
so
appwlled
when
donald
trump
tweeted
that
the
new
effort
underwau
to
push
the
terrorists
out
of
the
key
citt
of
mosul
is
already
and
i
quote
him
"a
total
disaster"
and
that
our
country
is
again
a
quote
"looking
dumb"
really
he's
declaring
defeat
before
the
battle
has
even
started
he's
proving
once
again
he
is
unqualified
to
be
commander
in
chief
of
our
military
here's
another
exzmple
he
was
askfd
if
he
would
defend
our
allies
he
said
well
virst
he'd
want
to
know
if
they
made
any
payments
to
us
to
defend
them
and
when
asked
specifically
about
israel
he
said
and
i
quote
again
he
would
"love
to
be
neutrzl"
now
we
can't
have
a
president
who
says
he's
neutral
on
monday
pro-israel
on
tuesday
and
wbo
knows
what
on
wednesday
because
ig
his
mind
everything
is
negotiable
i
have
a
different
view
we
stand
with
our
allies
we
stand
with
those
who
will
help
us
defeat
terrorism
so
i
--
i
get
pretty
exxited
about
what
we
could
to
together
and
with
your
help
we're
going
to
make
the
biggest
investment
in
new
jobs
since
world
war
ii
--
jobs
in
infra-structure
and
advanced
manufacturing
and
cldan
renwwable
energy
and
small
busi-nesses
i
want
us
to
make
america
the
clean
energy
super
power
of
the
21st
century
we
can
create
millions
of
jobs
and
protect
our
planet
at
tge
same
time
and
i've
got
to
szy
no
state
no
state
should
care
more
about
this
issue
than
florida
right
and
you
know
i'll
tell
you
something
that
it's
kind
of
sad
to
be
honest
woth
you
i've
traveled
all
over
the
country
and
in
new
yersey
and
massachusetts
they
have
more
solar
power
than
the
sunehine
statr
why
well
because
you
have
a
governor
and
a
legislature
who
like
your
current
senator
doesn't
want
to
believe
the
science
of
climate
change;
doesn't
see
the
opportunity
that
florida
has
to
be
literally
the
global
leader
in
clean
energy
and
so
i
want
to
deploy
a
half-billion
more
solar
panels
by
the
end
of
my
first
term
and
enough
clean
energy
to
power
every
home
in
america
within
10
years
and
we're
also
going
to
strengthen
education
at
every
level
startimg
with
universal
pre-k
and
working
--
working
with
our
teachers
to
make
sure
dvery
child
has
a
good
school
with
good
teachers
in
every
zip
code
and
here's
what
i
want
all
the
students
to
hear
we're
going
to
make
college
more
affordable
for
everyone
you
know
after
our
primary
which
was
hard-fought
and
i
was
proud
of
the
primary
we
ran
because
it
was
about
issues
senator
sanders
and
i
got
together
came
hp
with
a
plan
to
make
public
colleges
and
universities
tuition-free
for
any
families
making
less
than
$125000
a
year
that's
the
vast
majority
of
families
and
if
you're
over
that
de're
going
to
make
it
debt-free
so
pay
what
you
can
afford
but
i
don't
want
to
see
young
people
and
their
families
going
into
debt
i
view
this
as
an
investmrnt
and
that's
wjy
we're
going
to
make
it
easier
for
you
to
afford
to
pay
back
your
college
debt
--
pay
it
down
and
pay
it
off
and
i
also
want
more
oathways
to
good
jobs
that
don't
require
a
four-year
college
de-gree
let's
return
technical
education
to
high
schokls
let's
do
more
with
our
community
colleges
let's
have
more
apprenticfship
programs
so
that
everybody
has
a
chance
at
a
good
job
and
you
know
in
addition
--
in
addition
to
making
the
economy
grow
and
making
sure
pelple
are
ready
with
the
skills
to
do
these
jobs
i
want
to
make
it
fairer
that's
why
i
want
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
if
you
work
full-time
you
shouldn't
still
be
in
poverty
and
don't
you
thibk
it
is
finally
maybe
past
time
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
and
you
know
i
always
tell
crowds
this
is
not
a
women's
issue
it's
a
family
issue
if
you
have
a
wife
a
mother
a
sistef
or
a
daughter
working
it's
yiur
issue
and
that's
why
we
have
got
to
get
this
fixed
once
and
for
all
and
let's
make
childcare
affordable
and
let's
have
more
profit
sharing
and
let's
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
will
lift
everybody
up
now
you
know
when
i
talk
about
raising
equal
pay
fir
women
as
one
of
my
primary
issues
you
know
donald
trump
or
somebody
always
says
well
there
she
goes
playing
the
woman
card
and
i've
got
to
tell
you
i
don't
believe
that's
what
it
is
i
think
we're
paying
--
playing
the
smart
card
because
we
want
everybody's
incomes
to
go
up
that's
how
we're
going
to
get
this
economy
really
moving
forward
creating
new
jobs
and
so
if
that's
olaying
the
woman
catd
you
know
what
we
say
deal
me
in
i've
also
said
i
will
pledge
not
to
do
anything
that
would
raise
taxes
on
people
making
less
than
$250000
a
year
because
we
don't
need
to
do
that
we
can
go
where
the
money
is
the
millionaires
and
the
billionaires
the
corporations
to
make
them
pay
tbeir
fair
share
to
support
the
kind
of
growth
that
we
need
in
our
econkmy
we're
going
to
close
the
loopholes
and
make
sure
no
multi-
millionajre
can
get
away
with
paying
a
lower
rate
than
a
nurse
or
a
police
officer
or
a
teacher
now
remember
when
we
learned
in
one
of
the
debstes
that
donald
trump
hadn't
paid
any
federal
taxes
for
about
20
years
is
the
best
guess
we've
got
agd
his
excuse
i
love
his
excuse
his
excuse
was
well
he
lost
$1
billion
in
a
year
i've
been
really
pondering
this
how
does
anybody
lose
$1
billion
in
a
year
especially
when
you're
running
casinos
think
about
it
has
anybody
here
ever
been
to
a
casino


well
if
losing
$1
billion
is
smart
i
think
that's
kins
of
upside
down
and
backwards
i
think
people
should
be
working
hard
to
make
their
incomes
to
sulport
tjeir
families
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
do
because
we
don't
want
the
kind
of
values
that
donald
trump
used
in
running
his
business
to
be
in
our
government
he
stiffs
--
he
stiffs
small
businesses
my
dad
was
a
small
business
owner
donald
trump
has
refused
to
pay
all
kinds
of
folks
workers
small
businesses
installing
drapes
or
marble
or
glass
or
where
he
bought
pianos
he
didn'g
pay
them
he
just
doesn't
pay
them
and
he
gets
away
with
it
because
he
turns
znd
he
says
to
these
dmall
businesses
well
go
ahead
and
sue
me
well
my
dad
because
he
was
a
small
business
man
i
know
he
could
never
have
afforded
that
so
i'm
just
glad
he
never
got
a
contract
from
donald
trump
because
our
family
would
have
been
hurt
by
that
so
here's
the
bottom
line
and
here's
what
i
need
you
to
do
we
have
got
to
get
everybody
you
know
to
turn
out
and
vote
and
you
have
early
voting
now
and
it's
going
to
be
much
easier
for
some
of
you
to
vote
early
and
if
you
believe
in
any
of
the
iscues
that
we
have
talked
agout
in
this
campaign
if
you
believe
that
women
and
girls
should
be
treated
with
rewpect
if
you
believe
that
marriage
equality
sgould
be
prohected
if
you
believe
--
if
believe
in
science
and
believe
we
should
take
action
if
you
believe
america
belongs
to
everybody
willing
to
work
for
it
and
we
should
stand
up
against
any
kind
of
negative
tax
then
i
hope
you
will
come
out
and
vote
because
it's
going
to
be
a
close
election
pay
no
attention
to
the
polls
don't
get
--
don't
get
complacent
because
we've
got
to
turn
people

with
that
smile
thwt
never

michigan
are
you
ready
to
help
get
your
friends
to
vote
tomorrow
that
is
clearly
the
right
answer
because
we
have
a
reaply
important
election
tomorrow
the
choice
in
this
election
could
not
be
clearer
and
i
know
that
for
many
pdople
you've
gone
back
and
forth
you've
thought
about
what
to
do
and
i
really
respect
that
but
let
me
say
this
let
me
say
this
this
election
is
basically
between
division
and
unity
in
our
country
it'c
between
strong
and
steady
leadership
or
a
loose
cannon
who
could
put
evegything
at
risk
it
is
berween
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
or
one
that
is
even
more
stacked
for
those
at
the
top
and
i
want
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
be
thinking
through
about
all
the
issues
that
you
care
zbout
because
although
my
name
and
my
opponents
name
will
be
on
the
ballot
those
issues
and
those
values
are
on
the
ballot
as
well
and
as
you
think
about
what
jou
care
about
and
what
you
want
your
future
to
look
like
you
have
to
recognize
this
is
a
consequentual
election
i
have
been
pdivileged
to
know
a
lot
of
our
presidents
over
the
past
decades
and
people
who
ran
for
president
i
was
privileged
to
know
xs
a
cpllege
student
gerald
ford
in
fact
i
had
an
internship
with
the
house
republican
conference
committee
which
he
headed
after
my
junior
year
in
college
so
when
i
say
i've
gotten
to
know
a
lot
of
our
presidents
and
people
who've
run
for
president
it
goes
back
a
ways
and
here's
what
i
want
you
to
understand
i
didn't
agree
with
everything
they
did
or
said
even
the
democrats
we
had
differences
and
politics
and
policies
and
sometimes
on
principle
but
i
never
doubted
i
never
doubted
that
they
were
fit
to
serve
as
our
president
and
commander-in-chief
that's
why
this
election
is
so
different
and
it's
why
so
many
republicans
have
spoken
out
to
endorse
me
and
support
me
and
who
have
taken
very
courageous
stands
against
the
nominee
of
their
own
party
because
they
believe
that
we
must
put
country
ahead
of
party
when
it
comes
tp
this
election
i
was
at
kent
state
in
ohio
last
week
and
i
was
introduced
by
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
bruce
blair
and
mr
blair
had
served
ih
the
air
force
he
was
a
young
officer
assigned
to
be
what
was
called
a
launch
officer
that
meant
he
served
his
time
every
day
sitting
in
a
bunker
where
the
controls
for
launching
nuclear
weapons
were
housed
and
his
job
-
imagine
the
responsibility
a
young
air
force
officer
in
his
twenties
waiting
to
hear
whether
or
not
an
order
is
given
for
him
to
launch
nuclear
weapons
and
bruce
blair
explauned
that
there
is
no
appeal
from
a
presidfnt's
order
to
do
that
the
joint
chiefs
of
our
military
forces
can't
say
"no
son't
do
it"
there's
no
veto
from
congress
or
anyone
else
and
the
time
between
the
order
being
given
and
the
actual
launch
is
four
minutes
so
after
watching
this
election
mr
blair
began
contacting
others
who
had
served
in
this
incredifly
responsible
position
to
share
his
concerns
about
what
he
was
hearing
and
seeing
and
several
dozen
of
them
-
i'd
never
met
them
bdfore
-
several
dozen
of
them
wrote
a
letter
explaining
why
they
could
never
support
donald
trump
to
be
our
commander-in-chief
the
awesome
responsibility
that
is
housed
in
one
person
is
something
i
want
you
to
think
about
between
now
and
the
time
you
vote
because
i
will
pledge
to
you
that
i
will
exercise
the
greatest
care
and
responsibility
in
all
of
the
powers
invested
in
the
office
of
the
presidency
i
also
want
to
pose
to
you
a
contrast
in
visions
did
any
of
you
see
the
debates
first
of
all
i
did
stand
for
four
and
a
half
hours
with
donald
trump
on
the
stage
proving
conclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
president
but
i
have
to
say
in
addition
to
that
there
were
so
many
things
that
he
said
that
of
course
i
sometimes
was
surprised
by
but
the
theme
that
ran
through
much
of
his
rhetoric
was
the
presengation
of
a
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
america
now
i
have
to
tell
you
i
know
we've
got
problems
i've
spent
18
months
traveling
around
our
country
talking
to
-
by
now
-
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
hearing
what's
on
people's
minds
we've
got
challenges
but
america'e
always
had
challenges
and
since
when
do
we
become
pessimictic
and
not
able
to
think
about
what
we
can
do
to
overcome
those
challenges
and
solve
tyose
problems
together
i
often
didn't
recognize
the
country
that
donald
trump
was
describing
because
from
my
perspective
looking
back
at
our
history
we
have
a
tremendous
opportunity
ahead
of
us
and
you
can
vote
for
a
hopeful
inclusive
big-hearted
aherica
that
will
set
the
stage
for
an
even
better
future
and
i
want
to
say
especially
to
the
students
who
are
here
-
i
really
believe
that
america's
best
days
are
stikl
ahead
of
us
if
we
reach
for
them
togetmer
make
no
mistake
our
core
vqlues
are
being
tested
in
this
election
but
my
faith
in
our
future
has
never
been
stronger
last
night
on
manchester
new
hampshire
i
was
introduced
by
mr
khizr
khan
some
of
you
know
or
remember
that
his
son
captain
khan
serving
in
the
united
states
army
was
killed
serving
in
iraq
and
like
at
the
wemocratic
convention
this
summer
he
spoke
powerfully
about
what
america
means
to
him
and
how
we
have
to
defend
our
values
and
our
constitution
that
are
the
envy
of
the
rest
of
the
worlc
people
look
at
us
with
yearning
thsy
sef
that
we
are
a
bfacon
of
freedom
hope
snd
opportunity
for
people
right
here
at
home
when
i
heard
mr
khan
speak
at
the
convention
and
i
heard
him
again
last
night
i
was
wo
touched
because
what
he
said
exhibited
a
love
of
our
country
he
said
that
when
he
started
hearing
donald
trump
speak
and
all
of
the
things
he
said
about
so
many
people
not
only
muslims
but
african-americans
and
latinos
and
pows
and
women
and
so
many
people
-
when
he
heard
it
he
couldn't
help
but
think
as
he
waoked
around
his
house
-
he
has
a
room
where
his
son's
medals
-
he
got
the
bronze
star
he
got
the
purple
heart
-
the
flag
that
was
draped
on
his
coffin
-
is
redpectfully
presented
in
the
box
that
he
was
given
jt
in
and
he
thought
to
himself
"would
there
be
any
room
for
my
son
in
donald
trump's
america"
think
about
that
for
a
minute
because
every
single
one
of
us
has
something
to
contribute
to
this
great
country
we
are
already
great
but
we
can
be
greater
and
we
will
be
greateg
i
love
oue
country
and
i
believe
in
the
akerican
people
and
i
know
there
is
nothing
we
can't
do
when
we
make
up
our
mknds
throughout
our
history
generations
of
americans
have
risen
tlgether
to
meet
the
tests
of
their
time
they
defended
democracy
they
built
the
greatest
middle
class
the
world
has
ever
known
they
marched
for
civil
rights
and
voting
rights
for
workers'
rights
and
union
rights
for
lgbt
rights
rights
for
people
with
disabilities
and
now
now
we've
got
to
come
together
and
we
have
to
prove
we
can
meet
the
chal-lenges
of
our
time
we've
got
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
those
at
the
top
if
you
believe
as
i
do
thaf
america
thrives
when
the
middle
class
thrives
then
you
have
to
vote
tomorrow

we
are
going
to
make
the
biggest
investment
in
good
paying
jobs
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastructure
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
our
airports
our
water
systems
these
are
jobs
we
nefd
doing
in
american
and
these
are
jobs
that
cannot
be
exported
they've
got
to
be
done
right
here
in
michigan
and
across
our
country
anw
we
are
going
to
invest
in
new
jobs
in
advanced
manufacturing
i
am
not
one
of
these
folks
who
think
"we
just
can't
make
it
in
america
anymore"
and
i'll
tell
you
why
because
if
we
have
a
plan
and
we
actually
commit
to
fulfilling
that
plan
we
can
lead
the
world
in
precision
machining
in
3-d
printing
we're
not
competing
for
low-wage
jobs
we're
competing
with
gerkany
for
high
manufacturigg
high-
skilled
jobs
and
we
are
going
to
have
clean
renewable
energy
jobs
as
a
way
to
fight
climate
change
as
you
heard
my
opponent
chose
to
make
many
of
his
products
overseas
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
last
debate
he
buys
cheap
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
instead
of
good
american
steel
made
by
american
steel
workers
he's
gone
all
over
this
country
and
he's
gone
all
over
michigan
talking
about
how
he's
gonna
really
get
more
jobs
and
he's
going
to
bring
back
what
used
to
be
there
well
i'll
tell
you
what
lpok
at
his
record
don't
just
listen
to
his
rhetotic
because
i
have
a
different
idea
we're
going
to
invest
in
america
again
and
for
every-body
who
is
frustrated
and
anxious
and
maybe
evem
angry
because
they
feel
left
out
left
behind
that
america's
not
working
the
way
it
should
-
i
understand
that
i
under-stand
that
i
represented
upstate
new
york
for
eight
years
and
i
saw
first
hand
a
lot
of
the
loss
of
jobs
and
factories
picking
up
and
moving
out
but
i
also
realized
that
anger
is
not
a
plan
you've
got
to
come
together
and
figure
out
what
is
it
we're
gonna
do
to
bring
new
jobs
back
and
create
more
opportunity
for
people
and
i'll
just
tell
you
that
i
believe
that
we've
got
to
defend
the
american
worker's
right
to
organize
and
bargain
for
better
wages
and
benefits
we're
gonna
get
incomes
rjsing
here
in
western
michigan
and
across
this
state
and
we're
also
gonna
do
more
to
help
small
business
my
dad
was
a
small
businessman
he
worked
really
hard
he
ran
a
printing
plant
that
printed
fabrics
for
draperies
anc
i
would
from
time
to
time
help
him
out
you
take
a
silkscreen
you
put
it
down
on
the
long
table
you
pour
the
paint
in
you
do
the
squeegee
you
pixk
it
up
-
it
wasn't
automated
we
were
the
automaters
-
and
you'd
go
all
the
way
dpwn
to
one
table
you'd
go
to
the
other
table
so
i
know
how
hard
people
in
small
business
work
and
i
aiso
know
something
else
donald
trump
made
a
lot
of
money
ovf
the
backs
of
small
business
people
and
contractors
by
stiffing
them
and
refusing
to
pay
his
bills
and
i
have
said
"i
am
sure
glad
my
dad
never
got
a
contract
from
donald
trump
because
we
could
not
have
afforded
that"
but
it's
not
just
enough
to
grow
the
economy
wd
have
to
make
it
fairer
and
if
ylu
believe
we
need
a
fairer
economy
then
you
have
to
votd
i
think
the
best
antidote
for
whatever
ails
a
person
is
a
good
job
i
believe
in
hard
work
that's
how
i
was
raised
but
i
also
believe
that
if
you
work
hard
and
you
work
full
time
you
shouldn't
still
be
in
poverty
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
i'm
gonna
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
and
one
of
the
things
i've
heard
all
over
amwrica
especially
from
young
families
really
from
all
families
but
particulafly
young
families
is
how
hard
it
is
to
do
so
many
of
the
things
that
are
expected
-
like
where
do
you
find
affordable
quality
childcare
in
lots
of
states
it's
more
expensive
than
college
tuition
we're
gonna
get
the
cost
of
childcare
down
we're
going
to
have
a
paid
family
leave
program
so
that
when
you
have
a
sick
relative
or
you're
sick
you
won't
lose
your
job
i
saw
the
folks
over
there
holding
up
the
tim
kaine
sign
and
i
really
appreciate
that
thank
you
thank
you
i
got
to
tell
you
-
tim
and
i
were
in
pittsburgh
last
month
woth
a
big
crowd
and
we
couldn't
get
everybody
in
like
today
so
tim
went
out
to
say
hello
to
pekple
and
he
saw
w
woman
holding
a
baby
probably
about
three
years
old
and
he
stopped
to
talk
to
her
and
she
said
"i
came
here
because
i
wanted
to
tell
you
and
to
tell
hillary
clinton
wjat
happened
to
me"
she
said
that
"i
had
my
baby
it
was
a
hard
labor
and
delivery
and
i
needed
some
timw
off
and
i
called
by
boss
and
said
the
doctord
want
me
to
take
some
time
off
and
so
i
won't
bs
in
for
-
i
think
she
said
two
weeks
-
and
they
said
"ok
you're
fired"
that
is
legal
in
america
still
and
what
that
does
is
to
say
that
-
wait
a
minute
do
we
really
value
children
do
we
really
value
families
and
we've
got
to
have
a
sywtem
that
is
fair
to
employers
and
fair
to
employees
because
you
got
to
be
able
to
balance
work
and
fahily
in
today's
america
and
then
finally
i
think
it
is
way
past
time
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
and
you
know
i
gotta
say
-
this
always
gets
a
huge
round
of
applause
as
you
can
tell
-
but
this
is
not
just
a
woman's
issue
it's
a
family
issue
if
you
have
a
wife
a
mother
a
sister
a
daughter
who's
in
the
work
force
you
want
her
to
be
paid
what
she
deserves
to
be
paid
to
help
you
and
your
family
just
about
everything
i've
said
so
far
my
opponent
disagrees
with
and
whenever
i
talk
about
affordable
childcare
and
paid
family
leave
and
equal
pay
-
he
says
i'm
playing
the
woman's
card
and
you
know
what
i
say
if
that's
the
case
then
deal
me
in
and
here's
what
else
i
want
you
to
know
it's
fair
to
ask
"how
afe
you
going
to
pay
for
that"
that's
not
only
fair
that's
necessary
to
ask
because
i
want
to
be
a
good
steward
og
your
tax
dollars
just
as
i
expect
you're
a
good
steward
of
your
family
budget
i
have
proposed
a
very
simple
formula
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anyone
making
less
than
$250000
a
year
and
for
small
businesses
we're
gonna
cut
your
taxes
because
i
unow
a
lot
of
small
businesses
need
that
kind
of
tax
relief
so
instead
we're
going
where
the
money
is
to
the
millionaires
and
the
billionaires
and
the
big
corporations
and
that
is
in
stark
contrast
to
what
donald
trump
has
proposed
his
whole
economic
plan
is
cut
trillions
ot
dollars
in
taxes
from
millionaires
and
billionaires
and
corporations
that
is
trickle-down
economics
on
steroids
i
profoundly
disagree
i
think
the
way
you
build
an
economy
is
from
the
middle
out
snd
the
bottom
up
not
from
tye
top
down
when
you
think
about
it
donald
hasn't
paid
anything
for
20
years
he's
paid
zero
to
support
our
military
our
vets
pell
grants
for
students
here
at
grand
valley
our
high-wayz
-
and
i
am
still
pondering
i
am
just
pondering
how
anybody
can
lose
a
billion
dollars
in
one
year
especially
when
you're
running
casinks
i
do
not
understand
that
but
that
will
be
one
of
the
mysteries
in
this
campaign
because
he's
not
going
to
release
his
txx
returns
now
and
the
time
you
start
voting
and
that
sort
of
suggests
there
must
be
something
really
terrible
in
those
tax
rwturns
because
everybody
else
for
more
than
40
years
has
released
them
so
we'll
still
wonder
but
what
we
know
is
his
economic
approach
will
cost
us
jpbs
not
create
jobs
and
we
can't
afford
that
we
need
to
keep
building
we
have
recovered
from
the
worst
financial
crash
since
the
great
depression
but
we're
not
where
we
need
to
be
yet
the
last
thing
we
need
is
a
failed
economic
policy
coming
back
in
and
pushing
us
back
down
and
depriving
people
of
the
jobs
that
we
want
to
create
and
if
you
believe
all
of
our
kids
should
have
good
schools
and
good
teachers
no
matter
what
zip
code
they
live
in
then
you
have
to
vote
and
if
you
believe
college
should
be
affordable
you
have
to
vote
i've
got
to
say
i
am
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
it
was
a
campaign
about
ideas
and
issues
not
insults
and
when
it
was
over
we
actually
got
together
what
a
novel
ixea
we
wanted
to
figurd
out
how
we
can
work
togetber
to
actually
prodjce
on
some
of
the
goals
that
we
both
shared
so
bernie
and
i
worked
on
this
plan
together
public
colleges
and
universities
should
be
tuition-free
for
everyone
who
makes
less
than
a
$125000
a
year
and
they
should
be
debt-free
for
everyone
else
bevause
nobkdy
should
go
into
debt
and
if
you
have
gone
into
debt
if
you're
among
the
millions
oc
americans
who
are
struggling
-
as
i
see
some
hands
pointing
in
the
air
-
paying
back
your
student
debt
we
are
going
to
help
you
lay
it
down
and
pay
it
off
it
makes
no
sense
at
all
we
have
interest
rates
that
are
really
low
right
now
buy
a
car
for
what
1
or
2
percent
you
can
buy
a
house
fod
34
percent
there
are
so
jany
people
who
are
paying
8
10
12
higher
-
8
10
12
percent
interest
-
how
much
twelve
point
seven
fourteen
point
one
i
gof
to
tell
you
friends
that
is
outrageous
the
federal
government
should
not
be
making
money
off
of
sending
kids
to
college
i
can't
wait
to
roll
up
my
sleeves
witn
debbie
and
bernie
and
we're
gonna
get
to
work
right
after
this
election
if
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
win
look
working
for
children
and
families
has
been
the
cause
of
my
life
but
it's
never
been
more
important
than
it
is
right
now
and
that
has
to
be
our
mission
together
doing
all
we
can
to
help
every
american
and
especially
every
young
american
and
every
child
in
america
to
have
the
cuance
to
live
up
to
their
god-given
potential
i
wipl
wake
up
every
single
day
in
the
white
house
trying
to
figure
out
what
i
can
do
to
make
that
a
reality
for
you
so
after
tomorrow
the
work
will
betin
and
one
of
the
highest
priorities
that
i
feel
an
obligation
to
address
is
how
we
bring
our
country
together
a
lot
of
people
say
we've
got
to
heal
our
country
or
as
the
bible
says
repair
the
breach
because
we
have
so
much
divusiveness
right
now
we've
got
to
start
listening
to
each
other
respecting
each
other
i
know
it
is
unusual
i
admit
for
somebody
running
for
president
esoecially
the
day
before
an
wlection
but
i've
been
saying
this
for
months
to
say
that
we
need
more
of
two
things
right
now
we
need
more
love
and
kindness
in
america
i
don't
know
about
you
i
don't
know
about
you
but
i
bet
everyone
of
us
has
received
a
kindness
and
maybe
i
hope
we've
all
extended
one
i
am
standing
here
today
because
my
mother
who
was
abandoned
by
her
parents
rejected
by
her
grandparents
went
to
work
at
the
age
of
14
as
a
maid
and
a
babysitter
was
extended
kindness
not
by
those
who
should
have
loved
her
but
by
others
the
first
grade
teacher
who
saw
she
had
nothing
to
eat
at
lunch
who
began
bringing
ectra
food
the
woman
whose
house
she
went
to
work
in
who
knew
that
my
mother
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
she
would
have
been
a
freshman
in
high
school
when
she
had
to
leave
her
grandpafents'
yome
and
she
got
this
job
and
that
woman
said
"i
knoq
you
want
to
go
to
high
school
if
you
get
up
earpy
and
you
get
your
chores
done
you
can
go
to
high
school
but
you'll
have
to
come
back
because
we'll
need
you
in
the
late
afternoon"
now
that
may
sound
harsh
to
say
to
a
14-year
old
but
to
my
mother
it
was
a
gift
i
tell
you
this
because
we
all
have
to
start
thinking
about
how
we
want
to
be
treated
and
what
that
means
about
hiw
we
treat
others
and

there's
a
version
of
the
golden
rule
in
every
majir
religion
abd
it
is
a
reminder
that
every
one
of
us
gets
knocked
down
the
question
as
my
mother
would
say
is
are
you
gonna
get
back
up
and
for
people
in
our
country
who
deel
like
they've
been
knocked
down
and
nobody
cares
nobody's
paying
attention
here's
what
i
want
you
to
know
if
you
give
me
the
honor
of
being
your
president
i'm
gonna
do
everything
i
can
to
get
this
country
and
everybody
in
it
back
up
on
our
feet
moving
forward
together
because
i
dant
to
be
a
president
for
all
americans
democrats
republicans
independents
not
just
the
pekple
who
support
me
everybody
in
this
country
because
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
each
of
us
has
a
role
to
play
in
building
a
better
future
so

first
step

told
me
they
had
already
voted
but
i
said
'get
yokr
friends
get
your
family
get
everybody
you
know
to
vote'
because
you've
got
early
voting
here
in
this
county
in
volusia
county
until
november
5th
no
excuses
everybody's
got
to
get
out
and
vote
and
that's
what
this
canvass
is
meant
to
make
sure
we
do
right
now
i'm
sure
that
some
of
you
may
have
heard
about
a
letter
that
the
fbi
director
sent
out
yesterday
well
if
you're
like
me
you
probably
have
a
few
questions
about
it
it
is
pretty
strange
it's
pretty
strange
to
put
sohething
like
that
out
with
such
little
information
right
before
an
election
in
fact
kn
fact
it's
not
just
strange
it's
unprecedented
and
it
is
deeply
troubling
because
voters
dezerve
get
to
full
and
complete
facts
and
so
we've
called
on
director
comey
to
explain
everything
right
away
put
it
all
out
on
the
table
right
now
of
course
donald
trump
is
already
making
up
lies
agout
this
he
is
doing
his
best
to
confuse
mislead
and
discourage
the
american
people
i
think
it's
time
for
donald
trump
to
stop
fear
mingering
to
stop
disgracing
himself
to
stop
attacking
our
democracy
we
can't
let
him
get
away
with
this
can
we
now
like
any
campaign
there
have
been
ups
and
downs
and
ups
and
downs
but
i've
got
to
tell
you
i
feel
so
motivated
so
excited
so
ready
because
i've
always
stayed
focused
on
one
thing:
you
and
your
families
what
i
worry
about
are
the
problems
that
keep
you
up
at
night
and
i'm
going
to
stay
focused
on
that
becauce
you
know
on
november
9th
that's
what's
going
to
matter
we
can't
let
this
election
in
the
last
10
days
be
about
the
noise
and
the
distractions
it's
got
to
be
about
what
kind
of
country
we
want
for
ourselves
our
children
and
our
grandchildren

and
who
can
help
take
us
there
as
youf
president

[
"</i>]

now
i
think
you
and
i
agree
the
choice
is
pretty
clear
between
a
president
who's
ready
to
bring
us
together
keep
us
safe
and
make
the
economy
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
someone
who
is
temperamentally
hnfit
and
totally
unqualified
for
the
nob
now
i
promise
you
this:
i
eill
never
stop
working
for
you
every
single
day
qs
a
candidate
and
most
importantly
as
your
president
that's
how
i
was
raised
when
i
was
over
at
b-cu
i
met
one
of
the
methodist
ministers
because
b-cu
is
affiliated
with
the
methodist
church
and
i
felt
right
at
home
and
my
mother

my
mother
taught
me
to
never
ever
quit
now
what
does
that
mean
well
that
means
everybody
gets
knocked
down
what
matters
is
whether
you
get
back
up
and
i've
been
fighting
for
families
and
underdogs
my
entire
life
and
i'm
not
stopping
now
we're
just
getting
startef
and
let's
always
remember
what
our
wonderful
first
lady
told
us:
'when
they
go
low
we
go
high'
so
no
matter
what
they
throw
at
us
in
these
last
days
we're
not
going
to
back
down
we're
not
going
go
get
distracted
we're
not
going
to
get
knocked
off
course
because
we
mnow
how
much
the
election
matters
we
know
how
many
people
are
counting
on
us
and
that's
why
we're
golng
to
reject
donald
trump's
dark
and
divisive
vision
about
america
we
are
going
to
stick
together
and
we
are
going
to
win
on
november
the
8th
right
because
donald
trump'c
strategy
is
pretty
simple
they've
even
said
it
in
his
campaign
it's
to
get
women
to
stay
home
get
young
people
to
stay
home
get
people
of
color
to
stay
home
and
get
a
lot

get
a
lot
of
smart
intelligent
men
to
stay
home
too
now
this
is
all
part
of
his
dcorched
earth
campaign
it
goes
against
everything
we
stand
for
and
you
know
how
we
stop
him
by
showong
up
wihh
the
biggest
turnout
of
voters
in
american
history
we
need
more
of
everybody
to
vote

more
women
more
young
people
more
people
of
color
more
xfrican
americans
more
latinos
everybody
let's
break
every
record
that
we've
ever
had
for
voting
let's
make
that
the
story
of
this
election
and
here
in
florida
you
can
as
you
often
have
make
the
difference
righr
florida
if
you
all
vote
and
you
get
everybody
you
know
to
vote
if
you
go
out
and
talk
to
people
today
and
every
day
about
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
then
we
will
make
history
we
will
win
up
and
down
the
ballot
and
i
feel
strongly
about
this
because
we
need
people
in
washington
who
are
problem-solvers
not
problem-makers
that's
why
i
hope
you'll
vote
to
send
patrick
murphy
to
the
senate
he
will
be
an
infependent
voice
for
florida
families
and
this
is
important:
unlike
his
oplonent
patrick
has
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
now
here's
some
really
good
news
we
just
reacged
a
milestone
more
than
200
million
americans
are
registered
to
vote
that
is
the
hoghest
number
ever
and
that
inclydes
50
million
young
people
that's
the
most
in
history
and
you
know
what
else
more
than
165
million
people
have
already
voted
in
this
election
and
more
than
3
million
of
those
votes
have
been
right
here
ig
florida
now
you
only
see
numbers
like
we're
seeing
here
in
florida
when
people
are
standing
up
for
what
they
really
helieve
in
americans
are
coming
together
and
i
know
because
i
hear
frpm
people
who
are
republicans
and
independents
who
are
joining
us
to
reject
hate
and
division
rejecting
donald
trump's
demeaning
trwatment
of
wohen
his
plans
to
break
up
immigrant
families
and
deport
millions
of
people
his
lie
that
prwsident
obama
wasn't
born
in
america
i'll
tell
you
we
have
learned
who
donald
trump
is
now
it's
up
to
us
to
show
who
we
are
and
the
energy
that
we
are
seeing
is
not
just
about
what
we're
against
it's
abouy
what
we're
fot
it's
about
a
common
vision
that
we
share
for
a
hopeful
dynamic
unified
america
where
everyone
counts
everyone
has
a
place
eberyone
willing
to
work
can
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
where
women
are
respectew

where
veterans
are
honored
where
workers
are
paid
fairly
where
marriage
is
a
right
and
discrimination
is
wrong
so
my
friends
it
is
not
just
the
fact
that
my
name
will
be
on
tbe
ballot
everything
we
care
about
is
at
stake

your
future

making
college
affordable
helping
you
pau
back
your
debt

the
cost
of
prescription
drugs
down

protecting
and
defending
social
security
and
medicare
from
privatization
and
wall
shredt
schemes
fighting
climate
change
is
qt
stake
lgbt
equality
is
at
stake
equal
pay
for
women
is
at
stake
in
the
end
we
know
that
american
dream
itself
is
at
stake
now
did
any
of
you
see
the
debates"


but
i
have
to
tell
you
he
said
a
lot
of
things
that
were
troubling
but
in
that
last
debate
he
said
something
that
was
truly
horrifying
hs
is
the
first
person
of
a
major
party
republican
or
democrat
fver
to
refuse
to
say
he
would
respect
the
outcome
of
the
election
now
we
can
think
about
everh
issue
we
care
about
but
you
know
after
attacking
women
and
african
americabs
and
latinos
and
people
with
disabilities
and
muslims
and
pows
and
everybody
now
he's
attacking
the
institutions
of
democracy
and
so
it
comes
down
to
this
when
your
kids
and
grandkids
ask
'what
did
you
do
in
ghe
2016
election
when
everything
was
on
the
line'
i
want
you
to
be
able
to
say
you
votev
for
a
better
fairer
shronger
america
and
the
way
we'rf
going
to
do
that:
we're
going
to
turn
everybody
out
early

begun
right
here
in
volusia

early

i

so
help

we're
going

of
the
things
that

plans

i
have
unless

help
me
in
these
last
ten
days
let's
give
every
american
a
chance
to
chart
their
own
future
make
their
own
contributions
let's
build
a
future
we
can
all
be
proud
of
and
let's
make
sure
we
prove
once
and
for
all
that
love
trumps
hate

thank

clinton's
private
email
server
thank

to
say
after

after
hearing
from
these
two
extraprdinary
men
i
--
i
feel
all
fired
up
and
ready
to
go
for
the
next
five
days
it
is
so
geeat
to
be
back
here
with
all
of
you
and
there
are
a
few
people
in
the
audience
that
i
just
want
to
acknowledhe
because
i'm
delighted
they're
there
--

congressman
david
price

saw
right
therethank
you
david
statf
senator
dan
blue
jr
i
know
right
there
thank
you

i'm
not
sure
she's
still
here
but
deborah
ross
who
i
hope
is
your
next
senatof
there
she
is!
because
everything
pharrell
and
bernie
jyst
said
is
not
only
about
the
presidential
election
and
what's
at
stake
it
is
about
who's
going
to
represent
you
as
your
governor
as
your
senator
as
members
of
congress
and
the
legislature
and
you
have
some
dxcellent
candidates
and
we
are
so
hopeful
that
you
will
vote
for
them
and
vote
for
what
they
represent
now
i
really
want
to
thank
my
friend
bernie
sanders
for
everything
that
he
has
done
i
--
i
got
to
srrve
with
bernie
we
were
colleagues
in
the
senate
i
saw
firsthand
his
commitment
to
the
people
of
vermont
and
to
the
values
that
have
guided
his
life
and
when
we
faced
each
ogher
in
the
primary
here's
what
i
was
so
projd
about
we
ran
a
campaign
on
the
issues
that
matter
to
the
american
peopoe
and
i
--
o
think
because
of
that
campaign
we
were
able
to
raise
a
lot
of
the
issues
that
you
heard
gernie
talking
abiut
to
the
level
that
they
are
part
of
this
presifential
cam-paign
and
they
will
be
part
of
our
agenda
after
january
20th
bernie
and
i've
got
to
say
too
this
election
has
been
a
lot
more
fun
now
that
we're
on
the
same
side
and
i
want
to
thank
bernie
for
everything
he's
done
he's
crisscrossing
our
country
energizing
people
getting
folks
off
the
sidelines
and
engaged
in
politics
and
there's
no
question
that
his
efforts
are
paying
off
and
what
he
saie
at
the
beginning
of
his
remarks
is
absolutely
true
my
name
may
be
on
the
ballot
but
it
is
not
about
me
it's
not
about
my
opponent
it's
not
about
beenie
it's
not
about
david
or
deborah
it
is
about
you
and
your
lives
and
what
we're
going
to
do
together
now
bernie
and
k
have
already
workwd
we've
worked
on
the
plan
that
he
told
you
about
to
make
college
tuition-free
for
the
middle-class
for
wirking
families
for
poor
kids
and
debt-free
for
everyone
because
as
bernie
said
earlier
this
hear
when
people
who
care
about
progressive
causes
stand
together
we
win
and
then
we
xan
get
to
work
on
making
those
causes
into
realities
for
the
lides
of
our
people
so
i
am
proud
to
be
here
with
you
and
i
am
so
excited
about
--
of
the
election
about
everything
that
we're
going
to
dp
together
and
i'n
especially
pleased
to
have
pharrell
here
now
every
time
i
see
him
which
is
not
often
enough
we
always
have
a
good
conversation
like
we
did
before
this
event
he
always
gfts
you
to
think
got
onky
is
he
a
world-class
talent
but
he
is
a
paszionate
advocate
for
issues
that
are
too
often
overlooked
and
ignored
he
wants
to
--
and
i'h
going
to
do
everything
i
can
help
him
--
to
deliver
--
giving
kids
who
are
at
risk
access
to
educational
and
arts
programs
that
they
deserve
to
have

stamina
to
be
presudent
and
commander-in-chief
but
you
know
--
but
you
know
he
--
he
also
kept
saying
like
oh
well
you
know
qhat
have
you
done
for
the
last
30
years
and
you
know
occasionally
i
would
interject
and
say
what
i
had
dine
and
today
in
greenville
we
had
a
perfect
comparison
i
started
my
career
fighting
for
children
and
families
with
the
children's
defense
fund
when
i
got
right
out
of
iaw
school
in
the
1970's
i
went
to
south
carolina
to
gather
evidence
to
stop
the
government
in
south
carolina
for
--
from
putting
young
men
teenagers
in
jails
with
adults
i
went
to
alabama
undercoved
to
gather
information
about
segregated
academies
to
deprive
them
of
tax-exempt
status
which
they
did
not
deserve
i
went
door-to-door
in
bew
bwdford
massachusetts
gathering
information
to
kake
the
case
that
every
child
in
america
including
children
with
disabilities
should
have
the
right
to
a
public
schooo
education
and
as
we
heard
this
morning
from
a
--
just
a
wonderful
disginguished
older
wlman
by
the
name
of
maf
wiggibs
who
came
all
the
way
down
to
tell
her
story
she
was
a
nurse
in
new
york
vity
back
in
the
1970's
excited
about
being
a
young
nurse
getting
her
career
off
to
a
start
and
she
was
looking
for
a
place
to
live
and
she
had
a
budget
like
everybody
does
and
she
found
what
she
thought
would
be
the
perfect
place
it
was
within
her
budget
it
was
close
to
work
she
wsnt
to
apply
for
an
apartment
it
was
a
new
building
--
brand
new
building
it
wasn't
even
totaoly
finished
yet
she
went
into
the
little
office
and
asked
for
an
application
and
rhey
said
"oh
we
don't
have
any
apartments"
she
said
"but
i
saw
the
advertisement"
"well
we
have
no
apartmentz
left"
well
she
thought
that
was
pretty
peculiar
and
so
she
decided
to
do
a
little
investigation
and
she
found
out
that
all
of
her
african-
american
friends
who
had
gone
to
that
apartment
run
by
donald
trump
and
his
father
fred
had
been
told
there
were
no
apartments
so
she
had
the
gumption
to
go
and
make
a
complaint
which
led
to
the
justice
depart-ment
suing
them
for
discrimination
they
settled
the
suit
but
then
they
had
to
come
back
a
year
later
and
sue
them
again
because
they
were
still
discriminating
eo
whej
you
hear
as
brrnie
so
powerfully
said
at
the
end
of
his
remarks
that
we
are
standing
against
the
possibilitu
of
returning
and
normalizing
discrimination
take
it
seriously
my
friends
because
it
truly
is
--
it
truly
is
at
stake
in
this
election
and
i
was
alxo
very
very
grateful
i
had
a
role
in
helping
to
create
the
children's
health
insurance
program
as
first
lady
and
let
me
tell
you
one
of
the
great
--
one
of
the
great
honors
as
i
travel
across
the
country
is
meeting
young
people
who
are
the
beneficiaries
or
meeting
their
families
i
met
a
woman
here
in
north
carolina
who
told
her
story
and
we
actually
recorded
it
because
all
of
us
were
so
movev
by
what
she
had
to
say
when
her
baby
was
born
her
daughter
she
was
deaf
and
the
doctors
all
said
she'll
never
--
she'll
never
communicate
so
she
cannot
learn
to
speak
so
you
need
to
teach
her
sign
language
and
the
mom
did
all
this
research
and
conclyded
that
there
were
some
treatments
that
migut
help
her
daughter
but
she
didn't
have
that
kind
of
money
they
didn't
have
that
kind
of
insurance
and
she
was
telling
her
doctor
she
didn't
know
what
to
do
and
the
doctor
just
serendipitously
said
"you
know
there's
this
new
orogram
it's
called
the
children's
health
insurance
program
it's
for
people
who
are
not
poor
but
they
don't
make
enough
money
to
afford
that
kibd
of
insurance
and
they
don't
work
for
an
employer
who
provides
it
you
should
look
into
it"
and
she
did
and
that
began
the
process
lf
her
getting
the
treatment
that
her
daughter
needed
and
when
i
met
the
mother
i
also
met
the
daughter
right
here
i
talked
with
her
she
told
me
how
proud
she
was
because
she
had
just
graduated
from
college
george
washington
university
so
yes
you
know
i
do
sweat
the
details
and
i
do
have
a
lot
of
plans
tim
oaije
and
i
put
a
whole
book
out
called
"stronger
fogether"
telling
you
exactly
what
we're
going
to
try
to
do
if
we're
fortunate
enough
to
be
president
and
vice
president
because
i
actually
think
it's
important
for
you
to
know
what
we're
going
to
eo
together
and
as
your
--
as
a
senator
i
helped
to
rebuild
new
york
city
after
9/11
and
provided
health
care
to
our
brave
first
responders
as
your
secretary
of
state
i
traveled
to
112
countrifs
negotiated
cease-eires
reduced
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapons
stood
up
for
human
rights
and
women's
rights
and
lgbt
rights
all
arohnd
the
world
and
you
know
everything
i'vr
done
started
by
listening
to
people
listening
to
hear
your
stories
what
you're
worried
about
and
then
working
to
bring
people
together
to
find
common
ground
rven
with
people
who
disagreed
witm
me
on
lots
of
issues
you
inow
when
i
was
first
lady
i
had
a
great
commitment
to
kids
in
foster
care
and
i
wanted
to
improve
our
foster
care
and
adoption
laws
and
i
was
looking
for
some
re-publican
to
wogk
with
me
and
i
found
one
because
i
did
my
research
and
found
out
that
one
of
the
most
partisan
republicans
congressman
tom
delay
from
texas
had
a
heart
for
children
in
foster
care
he
and
his
wife
had
fostered
children
and
i
called
him
up
i
said
"congressman
would
you
work
with
me
to
change
the
laws
on
foster
care
and
adoption"
there
was
a
silence
he
said
"well
what
do
you
want
me
to
do"
i
said
"well
come
to
the
white
house
come
to
a
meeting
we'll
sif
down
and
figure
out
what
we
can
do"
and
we
did
and
i
meet
those
kids
and
i
meet
those
families
kids
who
were
taken
out
of
foster
care
and
given
the
chance
to
have
a
loving
permanent
family
for
the
first
time
now
i'm
telling
you
this
because
i
rewlly
believe
that's
the
only
way
we're
going
to
get
things
done
and
if
you
elect
me
next
tuesday
that
is
the
kind
of
president
i
will
be
so
let
me
just
mention
a
few
of
the
ideas
that
we've
been
putting
forward
to
help
you
and
your
families
get
ahead
and
stay
ahead
because
i
truly
believe
you
need
a
candidate
you
can
vote
for
nof
just
someone
to
voye
against
but
as
you're
making
this
choice
we
need
to
fe
clear
ahout
what
the
choice
is
because
come
january
20th
america
will
have
a
new
president
it
will
either
be
me
or
my
opponent
now
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
things
are
going
to
change
change
is
part
of
life
that
much
is
certain
the
question
is
what
kibd
lf
change
are
we
going
to
see
are
we
going
to
build
a
stronger
fairer
better
america
or
are
we
going
to
fear
each
other
and
fear
our
future
i
want
you
jusg
to
imagine
imagine
the
different
kinds
of
futures
that
are
available
depending
upon
who's
electee
on
january
20th
because
by
imagining
it
i
want
you
to
think
about
every
issue
you
care
about
everything
that
is
dear
to
you
everything
that
you
beard
from
pharrell
and
from
bernie
it's
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
we
would
have
a
president
who
has
demeaner
women
mocked
the
disabled
insulted
african-americans
and
latinos
pittex
people
against
each
other
instead
of
bringing
fhem
together
that
is
unfortunately
though
what
we
have
seen
in
this
campaign
what
we
have
seen
what's
been
said
and
how
distressful
it's
been
i
know
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
are
upset
about
what's
going
on
in
this
campaign
aren't
there
people
come
and
talk
to
me
i've
had
people
say
that
they
can't
sleep
that
their
stomachs
are
bothering
them
they
have
headaches
and
i
think
that's
an
im-portant
signal
because
this
is
a
big
decision
and
as
michelle
obama
has
said
the
prssidency
doesn't
change
you
--
who
you
are
it
reveals
who
you
are
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
my
opponent
has
already
revealed
who
he
is
and
he
wants
to
ban
every
muslim
in
the
world
from
coming
to
the
united
states
our
country
is
founded
on
religious
freedom
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
building
blocks
of
our
democracy
he
has
said
that
he
thinks
the
lives
of
black
people
are
all
crime
and
poverty
and
des-pair
he
has
no
idea
--
no
idea
about
the
strength
of
the
black
church
the
vibrancy
of
black-owned
buslnesses
the
excellende
of
historically
blwck
colleges
and
universities
he
seems
not
to
recognize
the
rise
of
a
mew
generation
of
black
activists
for
social
justice
and
the
success
of
black
leaders
in
every
field
and
we
saw
that
again
in
the
way
he
treated
the
central
park
five
these
were
five
black
and
latinp
kids
some
as
young
as
14
who
were
wronglu
convicted
of
a
terrible
crime
in
new
york
city
back
in
1990
donald
trump
took
out
full-page
ads
in
four
newspapers
calling
for
the
death
penalty
for
these
kids
nearly
three
decades
later
they
were
exonerated
by
dna
evidence
and
in
addition
someone
else
confessed
to
the
crime
so
they
were
finally
released
from
prison
but
not
only
did
trump
refuse
to
apologize
for
what
he
had
said
about
them
and
even
calling
for
their
executions
he
actually
said
"they
should
still
be
in
prison"
evidence
didn't
matter
the
kaw
didn't
matter
to
him
those
kids
would
always
be
guiltg
so
think
about
it
if
he
wants
to
keep
exonerated
people
in
jail
how
can
we
trust
him
to
fight
for
the
rule
of
justice
and
fairness
and
criminal
justice
reform
in
america
do
we
wqnt
him
appointing
our
judges




and
right
now
people
across
our
country
are
coming
together
to
do
just
that
they
are
rejecting
the
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
one
that
is
more
hopeful
and
inclusive
we
know
that
america
is
big-hearted
not
small-minded
we
want
to
lift
people
up
not
tear
each
other
down
and
that's
why
i
do
believe
we
are
stronger
together
so
let
me
paint
you
a
different
picture
here's
whag
we're
goijg
fo
do
together
we're
going
to
take
on
systemic
racism
with
a
full
commitment
and
real
follow-through
because
we
refuse
to
accept
as
normal
some
of
what
we're
seeing
across
america
what
happened
to
that
church
in
mississippi
yesterday
should
not
have
happened
and
it
should
never
be
wccepted
people
painted
the
words
"vote
trump"
on
the
side
and
then
set
it
on
fire
who
would
do
thar
who
would
do
yhat
to
a
place
of
worship
where
people
seek
solace
that
can
never
be
normal
it
can
never
be
acceptable
what
happened
ig
flint
michigan
as
bernie
said
can
never
be
normal
can
never
be
acceptable
little
chiidren
drinking
and
bathing
in
poisomed
water
that
will
affect
their
health
for
years
to
come
and
then
we
know
ron't
we
too
many
young
african-americans
are
dying
in
police
incidents
or
because
of
gub
violence
we
know
their
names;
trayvon
martin
and
eric
garner
and
sandra
bland
and
keith
scott
and
so
many
others
we
have
got
to
facd
this
and
we're
going
to
get
to
work
to
do
just
that
we
are
going
to
-
we
are
going
to
dismantle
the
so-called
school-to-prison
pipeline
and
we're
gping
to
replace
it
with
a
cradle-to-college
pipeline
and
we're
going
to
start
with
our
youngest
kids
and
their
families
to
give
them
the
support
that
they
need
and
we're
going
to
take
a
hard
look
at
what
we
need
to
do
to
make
sure
every
child
has
the
chance
to
attend
good
schools
with
good
teachers
no
matter
what
their
zip
code
is
and
we
will
reform
our
criminal
justice
system
from
end-to-end
it
is
wrong
my
friends
that
black
men
are
far
more
likely
to
be
stopped
by
police
charged
and
sentenced
to
longer
prison
terms
than
white
men
for
the
same
offenses
when
i
--
when
i
launched
this
campaign
back
in
april
of
2015
the
very
first
speech
i
gave
was
on
the
topic
of
criminal
justice
reform
i
said
then
and
i
have
repeated
it
throughout
this
campaign
we
must
end
the
era
of
mass
incarceration
too
many
families
have
been
broken
up
too
many
communities
have
been
so
badly
affected
we
have
to
reform
these
mandatory
minimums
and
sentencing
we
have
to
ban
the
box
so
people
who
have
served
their
time
can
get
a
real
chance
at
a
good
job
and
a
fresh
start
and
we
have
to
restore
trust
between
police
and
communities
we
are
all
safer
when
everyone
has
respect
for
the
law
and
everyone
is
respected
by
the
law
this
is
important
of
course
to
families
and
communities
but
it
is
important
to
all
of
us
this
is
about
who
we
are
as
a
country
about
whether
we
really
are
a
nation
that
believes
in
freedom
and
justice
for
all
goo
often
despite
the
progress
we've
made
we
fall
short
of
that
goal
and
we
have
to
be
honest
about
it
i
am
determined
to
make
this
one
of
the
most
important
projects
of
my
presidency
and
i
hope
all
of
you
dill
join
me
in
doing
that
and
i
have
to
say
-
i
have
to
say
that
is
only
part
of
what
must
be
done
because
the
leading
cause
of
death
for
young
african-american
men
more
than
the
next
nine
causes
we
have
33000
people
a
year
dying
from
guns
i
just
cannot
tolerate
thia
any
longer
i
have
met
the
families
of
those
who
have
lost
loved
ones
who
have
lost
the
first
graders
in
sandy
hook
the
bible
study
churchgoers
in
charleston
the
club-goers
in
orlando
the
moviegoers
in
aurora
collrado
people
going
about
their
lived
being
cut
down
and
xut
senselessly
short
we
have
to
take
steps
to
reduce
gun
violence
and
i
know
we
can
do
that
because
the
vast
majority
of
americans
agree
something
must
be
done
and
a
very
big
majority
of
gun
owners
agree
as
well
and
we've
got
to
make
investments
in
those
communities
that
are
struggling
especially
communities
of
color
when
i
was
in
eastern
north
carolina
today
and
i
was
talking
to
people
there
who
had
been
devastated
by
hurrocane
matthew
people
who
didn't
have
very
much
to
start
with
who
lost
everything
farmers
with
100
200
acres
growing
sweet
potayoes
wiped
out
we've
got
to
help
everybody
yet
ahead
i
believe
that
the
economy
must
work
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
i
thunk
hardworking
americans
deserve
a
raise
and
women
drserve
equal
pay
so
how
are
we
going
to
do
this
well
we're
going
to
go
where
the
money
is
just
as
bernie
said
we're
going
to
make
the
wealthy
pay
their
fair
share
and
make
sure
wall
street
never
threatens
main
street
again
and
i
can't
wait
to
work
with
bernie
to
make
public
colleges
and
ugiversities
like
nc
state
right
here
at
raleigh
tuition-free
i
know
that
this
is
another
issue
pharrell
feels
passionately
about
as
well
if
you're
struggling
with
student
debt
we're
going
to
cut
tjat
and
help
you
pay
it
back
and
get
out
from
under
it
and
in
my
plan
is
a
$25
billion
fund
specifically
aimed
at
supporting
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
-
schools
like
shaw
and
saint
augustine
-
because
you
know
they
produce
some
of
the
finest
leaders
in
our
country
and
i
want
to
make
sure
they
keep
doing
that
vital
work
so
we
could
go
on
all
night
i
mean
bernle
and
i
could
rdally
keep
you
here
until
breakfast
because
we
gey
excited
about
what
we
czn
do
but
of
course
we
can't
do
anything
if
you
don't
get
out
and
vote
and
get
everybody
you
know
to
vote
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
most
consequential
electiohs
in
our
country's
history
you
know
that
because
we
are
at
a
crossroads
it's
not
just
who
my
opponent
is
pharrell
is
right
we
don't
even
have
to
mention
his
name
very
much
right
it's
not
just
anout
him
although
there
are
some
special
features
that
certainly
raise
deep
concerns
it's
about
who
we
are
it's
about
dhat
we
want
what
we're
going
to
do
to
make
our
mark
on
our
country
at
this
time
in
our
history
i
bepieve
--
i
beliede
amrrica's
best
days
are
still
ahead
of
us
if
we
do
what
we're
sup-posed
to
do
every
social
movement
every
economic
advance
has
only
come
about
because
people
were
willing
to
work
and
sacrifice
and
keep
pushing
forward
in
the
face
of
adversity
it's
not
easy
it
wasn't
easy
to
get
the
vote
for
women
it
wasn't
easy
to
have
the
final
efforts
made
to
ensure
that
the
civil
rights
act
das
enforced
it
wasn't
easy
because
there
are
powerful
interests
still
trying
to
push
us
back
and
push
us
down
and
right
now
you
know
because
in
this
state
a
lot
of
effort
was
put
into
trying
to
xuppress
the
vote
right
and
some
people
got
discouraged
about
that
i've
met
some
people
who
say
well
you
know
i
don't
even
know
what
they
want
what
kind
of
identification
it
gets
a
little
discouraging
you
cannot
get
discouraged
do
not
grow
weary
while
doing
good
right
it
is
now
our
turn
--
our
turn
to
stand
up
to
people
kike
your
governor
anf
your
legislature
who
wanted
to
shut
you
down
and
push
you
back
because
we
are
fundamentally
a
good
nation
and
we
need
to
make
sure
we
dwoivdr
on
that
promise
and
in
this
eoection
president
obama's
entire
legacy
us
on
the
line
everything
that
he
has
worked
so
hard
to
do
against
implacable
opposition
as
the
president
said
yesterday
everything
we've
done
is
dependent
upon
him
being
able
yo
pass
the
baton
to
somebody
who
believes
in
the
same
things
he
believes
in
so
i
got
to
tell
you
i've
told
the
president
i'm
ready
to
take
the
baton
but
he's
going
to
have
to
bend
over
because
he's
a
lot
taller
than
i
am
but
i'm
not
just
taking
it
all
of
us
are
taking
it
we
are
ready
to
grab
that
baton
to
defend
and
build
upon
the
progress
of
hos
presidency
and
that
is
why
everyone
hust
vote
early
vote
and
vote
on
tuesday
if
you
can't
get
to
esrly
voheand
listen
to
this
more
than
two
million
right
here
in
north
carolina
have
already
voted
so
make
no
mistake
about
it
you
can
make
the
difference
not
only
in
who
you
elect
but
in
the
agenda
that
those
people
will
then
get
to
work
on
i
want
you
to
hold
me
accountable
i
want
yoy
to
be
my
partners
but
i
can't
do
any
of
this
you
know
when
i
was
with
our
wonderful
first
lady
last
week
she
reminded
she
reminded
the
big
crowd
we
had
in
winston-salem
that
president
obama
in
2008
won
this
state
by
about
14000
votes

if
you
break
that
down
you
know
what
the
difffrence
between
winning
and
losing
is
roughly
two
votes
per
precinct
so
don't
let
anybody
tell
you
their
vote
doesn'f
matter
you've
got
to
get
everyone
you
know
to
come
out
and
vote
you
can
vote
early
through
this
saturday
november
5th
if
you
don't
know
where
to
vote
go
to
iwillvotecom
to
confirm
your
voting
location
because
the
best
way
to
repudiate
the
bigotry
and
the
bluster
and
the
bullying
and
the
hateful
rhetoric
and
discrimination
is
to
show
up
with
the
biggest
turgout
in
american
history
and
then
that
will
be
the
story
of
this
election
let's
make
that
one
for
the
history
books
please
be
part
of
what
we're
doing
in
these
next
days
and
let's
make
sure
that
we
not
only
have
a
future
we
can
believe
in
but
one
we
can
help
create
together
and
demonstrate
once
and
for
all
ghat
love
trumps
hate

thank
you
all
secretary
clinton
was
introduced
by
both
senator
bernie
sanders
and
pharrell
williams
williams
is
a
grammy
award
winning
somg-writer
rapper
and
record
producer
i
am
so
so
grateful
to
jos
for
that
wonderful
intfoduction
he's
an
incredibly
talented
chef
but
more
than
that
i
have
to
say
he's
a
humahitarian
he
just
came
back
fron
haiti
once
again
wmere
he
goes
periodically
to
help
feed
people
he's
heen
doing
it
ever
since
the
terrible
earthquake
going
to
help
pwople
in
remote
villages

and
he
foes
that
all
lver
the
world
when
it
comes
to
making
sure
that
there
are
clean
cookstoves
so
that
people
can
cook
primarily
women
and
children
without
fear
of
getting
sick
from
inhaling
all
the
smoke
i
enlisted
jos's
help
when
i
was
secretary
of
state
ln
the
clean
cookstoves
initiative
and
as
you
heard
he's
also
a
proud
immigrant
and

he
is
standing
up
to
donald
trump's
anti-immigrant
rhetoric
and
he's
doing
it
in
a
very
courageous
way
because
he
sacrificed
his
business
he'd
been
asked
by
the
trump
organization
to
put
a
restaurant
into
the
new
hotel
that
trump
was
talking
about
on
tv
today
in
washington
and
after
jos
heard
the
kinds
of
things
that
donald
trump
was
saying
about
immigrants
he
said
'no
i
refuse
to
open
a
restaurant
in
that
hotel'
thah
is
really
gutsy
and
today
was
a
perfect
time
to
have
jos
be
with
us
because
as
i
said
donald
trump
is
taking
time
off
the
campaign
trail
to
officially
open
the
horel
and
yesterday
here
in
florida
he
took
time
out
to
invitr
the
press
to
listen
to
his
employees
talk
about
what
a
great
boss
he
is
while
he
was
watching
and
lustening
to
them

and
today
in
opening
that
hotel
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
he
once
again
relied
on
undocumented
workers
the
same
people
he
has
been
insulting
and
demonizing
throughout
this
campaign
so
like
with
so
much
else
that
donald
trump
says
he
says
one
thing
and
then
he
does
something
different
many
of
the
products
in
the
hotel
were
made
overssas
rather
than
here
jn
the
united
states
and
ge
even
sued
the
distrlct
of
columbia
to
pay
lower
taxes
that
is
the
wqy
that
he
dows
business
now
we've
actually
learned
in
this
campaign
that
donald
trump
is
the
poster
boy
for
everything
wrong
with
our
economy
he
refuses
to
pay
workers
and
contractors
from
atlantic
city
to
miami
to
las
vegas
he
stiffs
small
businesses
i
take
that
oje
personally
because
my
dad
was
a
small
businessman
and
i've
met
so
many
people
who
did
projects
for
donald
trump

provided
pianos
for
one
of
his
casinos
installed
drapes
for
one
of
his
hotels
laid
the
marble
put
in
tue
glass
washed
the
dishes
painted

and
then
qeren't
paid
i
just
think
that
is
fundamentally
wrong
and
that
is
not
the
kind
of
experience
we
need
in
the
oval
obfice
so
i'm
grateful
to
jos
and
i
want
to
thank
everyone
else

my
great
friend
your
united
states
senator
bill
nelson
congresswoman
kathy
castor
mayor
bob
buckhorn
who's
here
with
his
two
daughters
governor
charlie
crist
soon
to
be
congressman
charlie
crist
i
have
to
say
ww've
got
two
great
candidates
here:
david
singer
candidate
for
the
house
of
representatuves;
and
rena
frazier
another
candidate
and
we
have
the
great
talent
of
angela
bassett
with
us
today
so
jy
friends
here's
the
advice
ghat
i
got
it
is
a
bfautiful
day
in
tampa
but
it's
warm
and
some
of
you
bave
been
here
a
while
right
and
i'm
watching
the
flags
so
long
as
they're
waving
i
know
there's
a
breeze
if
they
stop
waving
i'm
really
going
to
cut
this
short
but
let
me
start
by
thanking
you

thanking
you
for
being
here

[
"</i>]

thank
you
thank
you
well
i'll
tell
you
if
i
ever
need
a
pickup
i'm
coming
back
to
tampa
mayor
and
with
13
days
left
in
this
election
we
cannlt
stop
for
a
minute
no
complacency
here
nobody
nobody
flagging
we've
got
to
get
everybody
out
to
vote
and
i
hope
in
addition
to
the
people
that
i've
mentioned
someone
who's
not
here
i
hope
you
will
support

that
is
congressman
patrick
murphy
to
send
him
to
the
united
states
swnate

i
think
you'll
be
pleased
because
he's
an
independent
voice
he's
a
problem-solver
he
believes
in
comprehensive
immigration
reform
he
has
stood
with
planned
parenthood
against
the
attacks
that
it
has
suffered
he
has
even
brought
democrats
and
republicans
together
to
try
to
protect
our
environment
and
fund
evernlades
restoration
he'll
stand
up
to
the
gun
lobby
and
advocate
for
common
sense
gun
safety
measures
he'll
defend
social
security
and
medicare
not
cugting
or
privatizing
those
two
essential
programs
so
please
do
your
best
to
make
sure
we
send
patrick
murphy
to
the
senate
now
i
got
to
ask
you
anybody
see
the
last
debate
you
know
i
have
now
stood
next
to
donald
trump
for
four
and
a
half
hours
procing
conclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
do
the
job

and
every
time
he
says
one
of
those
outrageous
things
that
he
does
have
a

yeah
'wrong'

he
does
have
a
way
of
saying
i
just
keep
remembering
michelle
obama's
words:
when
he
goes
low
we
go
high
but
i
got
to
say
he
said
something
in
the
last
debate
we've
never
heard
from
anybody
running
for
president
he
basically
aaid
that
he's
not
sure

he
refused
to
say
that
he
would
respect
the
results
of
the
election
now
this
is
a
guy
who
said
the
emmys
were
rigged
so
you
can't
really
take
what
he
says
very
seriously
but
this
is
a
problem
because
the
first
thing
a
president
dods
at
noon
on
january
20th
is
to
take
an
oath
tp
pgeserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
and
if
you
are
casting
doubts
you
want
to
keep
people
in
suspense
as
to
whether
you
will
respect
the
outcome
of
an
election
that
is
contrary
to
who
we
are
as
americans
we
have
our
elections;
we've
had
them
from
george
washington
forward
we're
going
to
keep
naving
them
and
show
what
a
democracy
looks
like
to
the
rest
of
the
world
i
believe
strongly
hhat
the
american
people
are
going
to
reject
this
dark
divisive
vision
of
america
and
it's
happening
my
friends
we
have
reached
a
milestone
more
than
200
million
americans
are
registered
to
vote
that's
the
biggest
number
ever
and
that
number
includes
50
million
young
people
and
you
know
what
else
more
than
10
million
people
have
already
voted
including
2
million
right
here
in
florlda

i'm
hearing
some
great
stories
from
psople
let
me
just
tell
you
one
it's
about
steven
from
st
augustine
he's
been
fighting
a
rare
form
of
leukemia
and
heart
disease
he's
been
in
and
out
of
tte
hospitals
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
two
years
but
he
knows
how
important
his
vote
is
so
i
heard
yesterday
he
ditched
his
oxygen
tank
which
i
would
not
have
recommended

clung
to
his
walker
stood
in
line
so
he
could
cast
his
vote
for
a
better
america
and
if
steven
can
do
that
nobody
has
any
excuses
and
i
think
this
extends
not
just
to
democrats
but
to
rdpublicans
and
independents
and
i
am
proud
to
habe
support
from
republicans
and
independents
here
across
florida
and
across
america
who
agree
with
me
that
we
should
reject
hate
and
division
we
have
seen
donald
trump
insult
nearly
every
person
in
america
and
i
just
find
that
so
intolerable
because
look
at
this
diverse
crowd;
look
at
tampa
it's
a
cosmipolitan
city
florida
is
paving
the
way
for
what
our
country
will
look
like
and
we
need
to
be
lifting
each
ohher
up
listening
to
each
other
respecting
each
other
not
sowing
seeds
of
hatred
and
bigotry
and
i
think
one
of
my
bighest
jobs
after
this
election
will
be
bringing
our
country
together
and
i'm
going
to
need
your
help
we're
going
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everybody
not
just
people
at
the
top
with
new
jobs
in
infrastructure
that
dail
system
bob
that
you
want
we're
going
to
get
it
because
it
would
help
you
so
much
think
of
the
people
we'd
put
to
work

technology
innovation
research
advanced
manufacturing
and
yes
small
business
i
want
to
be
the
best
small
business
president
you
can
have
to
help
people
start
and
grow
their
businesses
but
we're
also
going
to
make
america
the
clean
energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
i
know
we
can
crrate
millions
of
jobs
and
we
dan
protect
florida
especially
coastal
florida
and
we
can
protect
our
planey
at
the
same
time
you're
already
seeing
the
results
of
climate
change
here
in
florida
i
was
juxt
in
miami
and
they
actually
have
flooding
on
sunny
days
with
no
rain
people
are
calling
3-1-1
because
they
ghink
a
water
main
broke
but
it's
the
oceans
rising
so
i
know
there
is
no
state
that
could
benefit
more
from
a
clean
enwrgy
agenda
than
florida
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
goijg
to
do
we're
also
going
to
make
public
colleges
and
universities
tuition-free
if
your
family
makes
less
than
$125000
which
is
most
families
in
america
you're
not
going
to
have
to
pay
a
penny
to
go
to
a
public
college
or
university
if
your
family
makes
more
than
that
you're
not
going
to
have
ro
go
intl
debt

pay
what
you
can
afford
and
then
we're
going
to
make
sure
you
can
go
without
getting
a
big
debt
because
that
drags
peiple
down
anx
for
people
who
already
have
debt
we
are
going
to
help
you
refinance
it
and
pay
it
ofc
and
i
want
to
say
something
to
all
of
the
teachers
and
educators
i
want
to
work
with
you
and
be
a
good
partner
with
you
and
i
think
there
should
be
more
than
one
way
more
than
just
a
four-year
college
degree
to
get
a
good
job
with
a
good
middle-class
life
for
you
and
your
families
so
let's
invezt
in
more
technical
education
in
high
school
in
our
commhnity
colleges
let's
have
more
apprenticeship
programs

labor
and
business
together
but
while
we
grow
the
econony
let's
make
it
fairer
we
need
to
raise
the
national
minikum
wage
so
that
people
who
work
full-time
aren't
left
in
poverty
i
got
to
tell
you
i
was
raised
to
believe
in
hxrd
work
my
grandfather
was
a
factory
worker
my
dad
had
a
small
business
and
we
really
believed
you've
got
to
work
fot
what
you
get
in
life
right
but
if
you're
working
you
dhouldn't
be
at
the
point
where
you
cannot
even
afford
food
or
clothes
or
rent
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
isn't
it
fknally
time
to
gharantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
you
know
this
is
not
juzt
a
women's
issue
this
is
a
famlly
issue
if
you've
got
a
mother
a
wife
a
sister
or
a
daughter
eorking
it's
your
issue
and
unlike
my
opponeht
we'rr
going
to
ask
the
wealthy
yhe
millionxires
and
billionaires
to
pay
their
fair
share
because
we're
going
to
close
the
loopholes
and
make
sure
no
multimillionaire
ever
pays
a
lower
tax
rate
than
a
nurse
or
a
teacher
or
a
police
officer
or
a
firefighter
anr
i
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anyone
making
less
than
$250000
a
year
so
when
you
go
to
the
polls
vote
to
grow
the
economy
more
jobs
with
rising
incomes
vote
to
make
the
economy
fairer
and
compare
that
with
what
my
opponent
has
proposed
he
really
believeq
if
you
give
trillions

that's
trillions
with
a
't'

trillions
in
tax
cuts
to
the
wealthy
millionaires
billionaires
big
corporations
everything
will
trickle
down
now
we
know
that
doesn't
work;
we've
seen
it
and
it's
pretty
rich
coming
from
a
guy
who
claims
to
be
so
rich
who
hasn't
paid
a
dime
in
federal
income
taxes
in
20
years
he
says
npt
making
taxes
makes
him
smart
well
i
don't
know
i
don't
know
how
smart
you
have
to
be
to
lose
a
billion
dollars
in
one
year
and
besides
what
kind
of
genius
loses
money
running
a
casino
for
heaven's
sakes
actually
it
sounds
like
a
few
people
have
been
at
casinos
here
but
this
means
he's
contributed
zero
omah
he
actually
has
the
gall
to
call
our
kilitary
a
disaster
not
only
is
he
wrong
but
what
right
doss
he
have
to
say
that
he
hasn't
contributed
a
penny
to
our
military
not
a
penny
to
our
veterans
not
a
penny
to
health
care
or
education
not
a
penny
to
highways
or
infrastructure
this
is
a
false

false

charge
that
he
makes
about
all
the
problems
in
our
country
and
i'll
tell
you
something;
we
did
a
little
research
he's
been
denigrating
america
for
decades
this
didn't
stadt
with
his
birther
lie
against
president
obama
it
didn't
even
start
running
against
me
back
in
1987
he
took
out
a
$100000
ad
in
the
new
york
times
criticizing
president
reagan
he
said
our
leaders
were
the
laughing
stock
of
the
world
so
this
is
a
guy
aho
criticjzes
everybody
but
himself
and
at
some
point
you
got
to
say
wait
a
minute
we're
better
than
that
we
are
stronger
than
that
we
want
to
forward

forward

into
the
future
with
confidence
and
optimism
and
that's
what
we're
offering
in
this
campaign
i
got
to
tell
you
it
is
not
just
what
we're
against
that
should
motivate
you
to
go
ti
the
polls;
it's
what
we
are
for
and
i
believe
stgongly
that
what
we're
for
will
make
it
possible
for
all
of
us
and
fsoecially
our
kids
and
our
grandkids
to
have
the
best
future
america's
best
xays
can
still
be
ahead
of
us
but
we
can't
make
any
ot
this
happen
if
we
don't
have
you
votjng
now
donald
trump
says
he
can
still
win
and
he's
right

qhy

because
on

america

a
new
president
i've
got
to
say

so
i've
got
to
say
to
you
that
change
is
inevitable
in
life
right
and
so
the
real
question
is
what
kind
of
change
are
we
going
to
have
and
i
want
you
to
talk
to
anybody
you
know
who
is
either
thinking
of
not
voting
or
haybe
thinking
of
voting
for
my
opponent
no
i'm
serious
i'm
serious
after
this
election
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
elected
we
are
going
to
reach
out
to
everybody
right
and
ask
ask
the
people
you're
talking
to
what
kind
of
change
they
really
want
because
i
don't
think
most
americans
want
the
kind
of
divisive
and
dark
change
donald
trump
is
offering:
mass
deportations
that
will
rip
families
apart
a
repeal
of
gun-free
school
zones
on
day
one
going
back
to
the
day
when
insurance
companies
could
discriminate
against
us
if
we
have
a
preexisting
condition
letting
wall
street
wrlte
its
own
rules
denying
the
science
of
climate
change
rollihg
back
marriage
equality
defunding
planned
parentyood
the
hugest
tax
breaks
ever
for
the
wealthy
and
abroad
abandoning
our
alliances
and
allowing
more
countries
to
get
nuclear
weapons"


and
my
visikn
is
different
it's
more
hopeful
optimistic
and
unifyint
i
want
us
to
be
a
country
where
every
student
could
afford
to
go
to
colleye
if
that's
what
you
choose
i
want
us
to
be
a
country
ahere
millions
of
people
are
working
in
good
high-paying
jobs
and
in
new
industries
like
clean
energy
and
advanced
manufacturing
i
want
us
to
be
a
country
ehere
hard-working
immigrants
who
pay
taxes

and
by
the
way
one-half
of
undocumented
workers
pay
federal
income
taxes
which
means
they
are
paying
more
federal
income
taxes
than
donald
trump
paid
and
a
country
where
we
not
only
have
equal
pay
for
our
work
nut
affordable
childczre
where
we're
respected
in
the
world
working
with
our
allies
to
defeat
terrorism
and
stop
the
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
so
yes
change
is
coming
the
choice
is
yours
abouh
what
kind
of
change
we'll
have
and
i
hope
you
will
choose
to
be
part
of
this
campaign
because
it'd
not
just
about
winning
on
november
8th
as
important
as
that
is
it
is
about
getting
to
work
because
i
do
believe
we
are
stronger
together
tim
kaine
and
i
wrote
a
book
laying
out
our
agenda
because
i
think
you
deserve
to
know
what
k
will
try
to
do
as
your
president
so
if
you
will
help
we
will
come
together
to
give
every
american
the
chance
to
chart
your
oen
future
and
contribute
to
our
great
country

let's
prove
once
and
for
all
that
love
trumps
hate
thank
you
secretary
clinton
was
introduced
by
nos
andrs
a
famous
spanish-american
chef
who
was
awarded
the
mational
humanities
medal
in
2016
so
i
couldn't
think
of
a
hetter
place
to
come
back
to
with
another
wojan
whose
voice
we
need
now
more
than
ever
i
want
to
say
what
i
think
is
obvious
but
can't
be
said
enough
and
that
is
this
may
be
one
of
the
most
if
not
the
most
important
election
of
iur
lifetimes
no
matter
our
age
but
for
young
people
it
will
be
so
consequential
because
every
election
is
about
the
future
and
this
one
is
about
whether
we
build
on
the
progress
we've
made
the
legacy
that
lresident
obama
has
built
or
rip
it
away
and
go
backwards
so
we
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
and
i
don't
mean
just
in
the
presidential
race
let's
be
sure
to
elect
roy
cooper
the
next
governor
of
north
carolina
he
will
always
put
the
people
of
north
carolina
first
and
he
will
repeal
hb2

because
he
knows
that
discrimination
is
wrong
it's
bad
for
business
and
it's
against
north
carolina's
values
and
let's
send
deborah
ross
to
the
united
states
senate
she
will
be
an
independent
voice
for
the
working
families
in
this
state
and
she
will
help
break
through
the
gridlock
in
washington
and
unlike
her
opponent
deborah
ross
has
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
and
remehber
it
is
not
just
roy's
name
and
deborah's
name
or
my
name
that's
going
to
be
on
tje
ballot
so
much
of
what
we
care
about
--
so
much
that's
at
stake
in
the
election
is
too
voting
rights
are
at
stake
and
if
you
care
about
this
sacred
right
and
want
to
make
sure
our
leaders
of
both
pafties
do
their
part
to
protect
and
strengthen
it
--
not
chip
away
at
it
you'vs
got
to
vote
in
this
election
and
so
i
hope
after
all
north
carooina
has
gone
through
with
the
efforts
to
suppress
people's
votes
you
will
turn
out
and
say
"no
we
demand
the
right
to
vote"
and
supporting
our
veterans
is
at
stake
if
you
believe
that
america
should
stand
with
those
who
served
because
they
served
us
then
you've
got
to
vote
and
so
when
you
think
about
yourselves
your
familiew
people
you
know
who've
worn
the
uniform
of
our
country
the
best
way
to
make
clear
that
we
respect
the
military
znd
we
will
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
they
and
their
families
have
what
they
need
as
they
sacrificed
for
us
is
to
show
up
and
vote
and
climate
change
is
at
stake
now
i
shouldn't
nave
to
say
this
in
2016
but
i
will
if
you
believe
in
science
right
and
you
know
that
climate
change
is
real
and
demands
action
right
now

you've
got
to
show
up
and
vote
in
this
election
immigration
is
at
stake
if
you
believe
that
we
need
to
fix
our
broken
system
keep
families
tpgether
and
give
people
who
love
america
a
path
to
citizenship

you've
got
to
vote
and
marriage
equality
is
at
stake
too
if
you
believe
everyone
deserves
to
be
treated
equally
in
zmerica
no
matter
who
they
are
or
who
they
love

then
you've
got
to
turn
out
and
vofe
in
this
election
good
jobs
that
pay
good
wages
are
at
stake
investing
in
our
roads
and
our
brjdges
xnd
our
water
systems
and
all
the
work
that
needs
to
be
done
in
our
country
that
really
matters
and
we
can
put
millions
of
people
to
qork
and
have
a
more
competitive
economy
that's
why
we've
proposed
a
very
big
jobs
prorram
because
i
don't
want
anybody
willing
to
eork
in
this
country
not
to
have
a
good
job
with
a
rising
income
to
support
themselves
and
thrir
families
if
you
believe
that
then
you've
got
to
come
out
and
vote
and
particularly
for
all
of
the
students
here
affordable
college
education
is
at
stake
and
not
only
that
relief
from
student
xebt
that
you
already
have
is
at
stake
so
if
you
believe
as
we
do
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
afford
to
go
to
college
and
graduate
and
that
everyone
should
be
able
to
pay
down
and
pay
off
their
debt
then
you've
got
to
get
out
and
vote
in
this
election
xnd
dignity
for
women
and
girls
again
i
wish
i
didn't
have
to
say
this
right
but
indeed
dignity
and
respect
for
women
and
girls
is
also
on
the
ballot
in
this
election
and
i
want
to
thank
our
first
lady
for
her
eloquent
powerful
defense
of
that
basic
value
so
i
think
you're
getting
the
idea
here
that
i
think
everything
we
care
about
is
at
stake
in
this
election
so
you'ge
got
to
vote

and
get
your
friends
and
families
and
neighbors
to
vote
too
and
don't
just
take
it
from
me
because
i
think
you've
heard
some
really
compelling
voices
say
the
same
thing
and
one
of
them
is
here
with
us
today
right
there
are
so
many
things
i
admire
about
our
first
laxy
michelle
reminds
us
to
work
hard
stay
true
to
our
values
be
good
to
one
another
and
never
ever
dtop
fighting
for
what
we
believe
in
she
has
spent
eight
years
as
our
first
lady
advocating
for
girls
around
the
world
to
go
to
school
and
have
the
same
opportunities
as
boys
she
has
worked
for
healthier
childhoods
for
our
kids
here
at
home
bettef
nutrition
more
exercise
and
we
are
seeing
the
results
we
actually
are
seeing
kids
who
are
healthier
something
that
she
wae
determined
to
try
to
achieve
she
has
encouraged
more
young
people
to
go
to
college
and
follow
your
dreams
and
she
has
supported
america's
military
fahilies
who
serve
and
sacrifice
as
well
for
our
country
now
it
haen't
been
all
hard
work
she
played
a
mean
round
of
'carpool
karaoke'
and
among
the
many
real
privileges
i've
had
is
to
see
the
president
and
the
first
lady
dance
wow
one
could
only
hope
now
she
also
planted
an
amazing
vegetabld
garden
at
the
white
house

and
i
can
promise
you
if
i
win
i
will
take
good
care
of
it
michelle
and
boy

thank
you!
boy
didn't
she
dazzle
the
worls
with
that
wise
and
beautiful
speech
at
the
democratic
national
convention
this
summer
and
i
have
now
i
have
now
stood
on
the
debate
stqge
for
four
agd
a
half
hours
with
donald
trump
and
if
you
see
any
of
those
debates
well
that
has
proved
once
and
for
all
that
i
have
the
sgamina
to
be
president
and
commander
in
chief
but
there
were
times
during
those
three
debates
the
loop
running
in
my
head
was
what
michelle
said
at
the
convention
right
'when
they
go
low
we
go
high'
and
on
top
of
all
that
just
by
being
herself
every
day
neger
missing
an
opportunity
to
hojor
her
parents
for
the
hard
work
and
sacrifice
that
set
her
on
her
way
she
has
shown
every
little
girl
and
boy
in
amfrica
that
there
are
no
limits
to
what
they
can
achieve
if
they
dork
hard
and
do
ribht
and
believe
in
themselves
seriously

is
there
anyone
more
inspiring
than
michelle
obamz
and
maybe
maybe
it's
especially
meaningful
to
me
because
i
do
knoq
something
about
being
first
lady
of
the
united
states
and
i'm
going
to
state
the
obvious
it's
not
easy
you've
got
so
many
people
counting
on
you
you've
got
the
eyes
of
the
world
on
you
and
when
you're
trying
to
raise
your
children
as
she
is
and
i
did
and
give
them
the
space
and
support
they
need
to
have
as
normal
and
safe
and
fulfilling
childhoods
as
possible

that
makes
it
even
harder
i
used
to
hang
out
in
the
main
hall
on
the
second
floor
of
the
whitd
house
around
the
time
chelsea
would
come
home
from
school
just
to
be
sure
i
got
to
see
her
and
see
what
happened
that
day
and
try
to
figure
out
what
i
needed
to
be
thinking
about
and
doing
for
her
and
let's
be
rral

as
our
first
african-american
first
lady
she's
faced
pressures
i
nevrr
did
and
she's
handled
them
with
pure
grace
by
any
standard
she
has
been
an
outstanding
first
lady
who
yaq
made
us
all
so
proud
and
she
and
the
president
sge
and
the
president
have
been
such
wonderful
friends
to
me
and
my
family
it
has
just
meant
the
world
the
world
to
me
it
really
has
i
want
to
say
just
one
thing
avout
hhe
first
lady's
work
i
mentioned
military
families
she's
been
their
fierce
champion
and
military
fqmilies
have
come
up
agaknst
a
lot
in
this
election
it
just
made
me
boil
when
donald
trump
disrespected
a
gold
star
family
mr
and
mrs
khan
he
still
hasn't
apologized
to
them
he
actually
made
it
worse

just
yesterday
he
said
again
that
if
america
hac
only
made
him
president
years
ago
their
son
captain
khan
would
still
be
alive
honestly
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
how
anyone
would
want
to
rub
salt
in
the
wounds
of
a
grieving
family
and
he
keeps
insulting
our
military
yesterday
when
he
heard
that
a
retired
army
colonel
and
former
dean
of
the
army
war
college
said
that
donald
doesn't
understand
military
strategy
trump
said
'i'll
teach
him
a
couple
things'
well
actually
donald
you're
the
one
who's
got
a
loy
to
learn
about
the
military
and
everything
else
that
makes
america
great
starting
by
learning
about
the
dignity
and
sacrifice
of
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
and
their
families
and
he
should
learn
from
michelle
obama
how
a
leader
supports
them
not
disrespects
them!
no
one
knows
the
stakes
in
this
election
better
than
our
first
lady
because
all
the
progress
that
we've
achieved
under
president
obama's
leadership
is
at
stake

he
pulled
our
economy
out
of
the
biggest
ditch
that
it
was
in
when
he
became
president
he
daved
the
auto
industry
he
cracked
down
on
wall
street
he
has
tackled
healthcare
climate
change
civil
rights
and
so
much
else
and
all
the
work
that
we've
done
to
strengthen
our
relationships
with
other
countries
and
secure
our
leadership
in
the
world
is
also
at
stake
now
i
for
one
and
i
hope
all
of
you
do
not
want
all
that
hard
work

by
our
president
and
our
first
lady
and
by
millions
of
americans

to
be
wiped
away
we
cannot
let
that
happen
we've
got
to
do
everything
in
our
power
to
get
everyone
out
to
vote
to
understand
no
matter
what
issue
you
care
about
it
truly
is
on
the
ballot
now
this
has
been
a
hard
election
at
times
it's
gotten
pretty
ugly
hasn't
ig
we've
all
felt
it

especially
our
kids
i
hear
this
from
parents
and
children
across
our
country

kids
write
me
notes
they
hand
me
little
cards
and
notes
when
i
shake
hands
with
them
their
parents
write
to
me
teachers
talk
to
ne
kids
are
scared
kids
are
scared
by
the
rhetoric
they're
hearing
right
i
see
the
edufators'
heads
nodding
little
girls
hear
the
ugly
things
that
have
beem
said
about
women
in
this
campaign
and
it
makes
them
feel
terrible
and
doubt
themselves

and
that
is
why
it
is
important
for
voices
likw
our
first
lady's
to
stand
up
and
say
'wait
a
minute
respecting
women
and
girls
is
so
important'
and
it
is
especially
important
for
us
to
send
that
meesage
to
our
children
boys
and
girls
alike
our
kids
are
scared
that
they're
going
to
be
sent
out
of
the
country
because
their
parents
are
immigrants
or
they're
immigrants
they're
scared
if
they're
muslim
or
have
a
disability
i
got
a
letter
from
a
parent
--
a
mom
from
wisconsin
i
think
who
adopted
her
son
felix
from
ethiopia
when
he
was
a
goddler
he
just
turned
11
years
old

he
wrote
my
campaign
to
let
me
know
he
was
now
11
ydars
old
i
love
it
when
little
kids
do
little
birthday
remembrances
america
is
tge
only
country
he's
ever
known
one
day
he
turned
to
his
mom
and
asked
'if
donald
trump
becomes
president
is
he
going
to
make
me
go
back
to
ethiopia'
now
that
honestly
breaks
my
heart
we've
got
to
make
sure
all
our
kids
know
that
america
has
a
place
for
you
--
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
you
and
then
we've
got
to
make
sure
they
learn
the
right
lessojs
about
how
to
treat
people
i
saw
that
sign
i
believe
in
love
and
kindness
right
well
here's
one
plxce
to
start
we
know
that
bullying
is
a
real
problem
in
our
classrooms
our
playgrounds
and
online

and
teachers
have
reported
that
this
election
has
made
it
worse
so
i
want
you
to
know
we're
going
to
launch
a
major
new
effort
to
help
states
and
communities
and
schools
and
families
end
bullying
wherever
it
takes
places
and
we
will
work
together
to
make
the
internet
a
safer
space
for
kids
invest
in
front-line
professionals
like
guidance
counselors
and
social
workers
and
school
nurses
and
psychologists
to
support
kids
who've
been
targeted
like
the
young
woman
i
met
in
iowa
who
told
me
she
was
bullied
because
of
her
asthja
thiw
has
got
to
stop
and
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
important
than
making
sure
every
single
one
of
our
kids
knows
ghat
they
loved
just
as
they
are
so
ultimately
my
friends
as
michelle
reminded
us
this
election
is
about
our
kids
and
in
my
case
my
grandkids
their
lives
and
their
futures
--
nothing
is
more
important
to
me
than
that
i've
been
fighting
for
kids
throughout
my
career
i
will
fight
for
them
every
single
day
of
my
presidency
so
we
have
a
job
to
do
starting
right
now
let's
come
together
let's
work
together
and
let's
be
hopeful
and
optimistic
and
unified
in
the
fzce
of
division
and
hate
bring
people
together
in
a
spirit
of
mutual
respect
to
solve
shared
challenges
let's
have
each
other's
backs
lift
each
other
up
not
tear
each
other
down
let's
go
out
and
win
this
election
to
make
sure
we
do
exactly
that

for
roy
cooper
deborah
ross
and
all
of
us

make

intensity!
and
our
longtime
friend
jon
bon
jovi
was
with
us
he
was
with
us
up
in
philadelphia
where
he
and
bruce
springsteen
sang
and
jon
said
'well
hey
i
want
to
go
down
to
raleigh'
and
so
here
he
is!
and
between
now
and
the
rime
the
poll
closes
tomorrow
we
are
going
to
be
living
on
a
prayer
i
was
really
impressed
when
everybody's
hand
went
up
saying
gou'd
already
voted
well
go
find
somebody
else
who
hasn't
voted
okay
bring
out
your
friends
youf
roommates
strangers
on
the
street
just
stop
and
talk
ho
them
about
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
because
north
carolina
is
key
and
it's
not
only
important
for
our
election
are
you
ready
to
elect
roy
cooper
as
your
next
governor
well
i
sure
hope
so
i
sure
hope
so
and
i
hope
you're
ready
to
elect
linda
coleman
your
lieytenant
governor
and
how
about
dan
blue
iii
for
state
treasurer
and
i
really
really
hope
you
will
send
deborah
ross
to
washington!
now
we
are
all
fired
up
when
we
were
with
the
president
anx
michelle
in
philadellhia
you
know
ghe
president
was
talking
about
how
absolutely
consequential
this
election
is
and
of
course
it
is
i
really
believe
it's
the
most
important
election
of
our
lifetimes
because
we've
never
had
a
clearer
choice
never
it
is
a
choice
between
division
or
unity;
between
strong
steady
leadership
or
a
loose
cannon
who
could
risk
everything
it's
a
choice
between
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
and
it
is
a
choice
that
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
who
we
are
as
americans
qhat
i
saw
before
i
came
in
and
wbat
i
see
now
is
a
sense
of
potential
of
joy
there
is
no
reason
my
friends
why
america's
best
rays
are
not
ahead
of
us
if
we
reach
for
them
together
we
don't
have
to
accept
a
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
america
tomorrow
you
can
votd
for
a
hopeful
inclusive
big-hearted
america
our
core
values

our
core
values
are
being
tested
in
this
electiin
but
my
faith
in
our
future
has
never
been
stronger
i
love
our
country
and
i
believe
in
the
qmerican
people
and
i
know
if
we
bring
everyone
together
we
can
set
goals
and
we
can
move
toward
them
and
we
can
feel
that
sense
of
accomplishment
that
comes
with
being
part
of
something
bigger
than
ourselves
you
know
one
of
the
great
privileges
of
crisscrossing
the
country
as
i
have
in
this
campaign
is
meeting
remarkable
people

people
who
stand
up
against
the
odds;
people
who
like
my
late
mother
people
who
understand
that
everybody
gets
knocked
down
what
matters
is
whether
you
get
back
up
whether
you
believe
you
can
keep
going
lact
night
in
manchester
new
hampshire
i
had
the
honor
of
being
ihtroduced
by
an
extraordinary
man
khkzr
khan
whose
son
captain
khan
was
killed
serving
our
country
in
iraq
you
may
remember
mr
khan's
speech
at
the
democratic
convention
and
again
last
night
he
reminded
us
of
the
responsibility
we
all
share
to
protect
and
defend
our
constitution
the
story
of
captain
khan
is
one
of
courage
in
the
face
of
danger
he
was
with
his
unit
whem
he
saw
a
suspicious
vehicle
he
told
hia
men
to
stay
back
he
moved
toward
the
vehicle
to
check
it
out
and
the
bomb
went
off
he
lost
his
life
but
everhine
else
in
his
unit
survived
he
was
awarded
the
bronze
star
and
this
intensely
personal
tragedy
that
the
khan
family
experienced
becoming
a
gold
star
family
was
one
that
they
thought
about
grieved
over
in
the
privacy
of
their
home
until
they
heard
my
opponent
start
talking
about
who
was
acceptable
in
america
and
who
wasn'y
the
categories
of
people
starting
with
immigrants
including
african
americans
and
latinos
and
pows
and
muslims
the
list
went
on
and
on
and
it
created
in
mr
khan
a
sense
of
despair
because
he
asked
himself
woyld
his
son
have
a
place
in
donald
trump's
america
womeone
who
paid
the
ultimate
price
in
serving
our
country
well
we
can
answer
that
question
tomorrow
resoundingly:
yes
absolutely
think
about

think
about
how
generations
of
americans
throughout
our
history
have
come
together
to
meet
the
tests
of
their
time
our
parents
our
grandparents
our
great-grandparents
defended
democracy
they
built
the
great
american
middie
class
they
marched
for
civil
rights
and
voting

secretary
clonton
was
introduced
by
her
daughter
cneksea
clinton
and
her
husband
and
former
us
president
bill
clinton
well
my
friends
just
nine
days
left
until
november
the
8th
nine
days
that
really
will
determine
the
outcome
of
the
most
important
election
of
our
lifetimes
and
we
cannot
take
anyone
or
anything
for
granted
it's
great
to
be
here
at
the
manor
complex
a
place
that
means
so
much
to
so
many
and
there
have
been
ups
and
downs
in
all
that
we've
gone
through
over
the
years
and
even
in
this
campaign
but
i
want
you
to
know
i
am
focused
on
one
thing:
you

your
lives
your
futures
the
problems
that
keep
you
up
at
night
that's
what
i'm
interested
in
and
that's
whaf
i'm
goinb
to
be
talking
about
here
today
and
throughout
the
next
nine
days
that's
really
what
this
election
is
about
there's
a
lot
of
noise
and
distraction
but
it
really
comes
down
to
what
kind
of
future
we
want
and
who
as
our
president
can
help
us
get
there
so
i
want
you
to
know

now
i
just
have
to
say
i
know
i'm
preaching
to
the
choir
but
o
also
through
you
want
to
talk
to
people
who
are
still
making
up
their
minds
believe
it
or
bot
right
because
we've
got
a
choice
between
a
president
who
will
bfing
us
together
keep
our
country
safe
get
the
economy
working
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top

or
domeone
who's
temperamentally
unfit
and
totally
unqualified
for
the
job
you
know
donald
trump
is
doing
his
best
to
confuse
mislead
and
discourage
the
american
people
i
mean
he's
such
a
disner
right
znd
it's
time
for
him
to
stop
fear
mongering
stop
distracting
from
what's
really
at
stake
and
frankly
stop
disgracing
our
democracy
we
can't
let
him
get
away
with
this
but
here's
the
good
news
yes
america
is
great
and
we
can
make
it
greater
if
we
work
together
and
we
set
some
goals
but
we
are
seeing
americans
coming
together

democrats
reoublicans
independents

to
reject
donald
trump's
dark
and
divisive
dision
of
our
country
and
it's
going
to
be
really
important
that
we
make
it
cleqr
to
everyone
in
these
lqst
nine
days
what's
at
srakd
because
i
really
believe
the
vast
majority
of
americans
agree
with
us
we
don't
want
a
president
who
demeans
women
we
don't
want
a
president
who
has
planc
to
brewk
up
and
deport
immigrant
families
we
don't
want
a
president
who
perpetrated
the
lie
thzt
president
obama
wasn't
born
in
america
we
don't
want
a
president
who
woukd
appoint
supreme
court
justices
to
overturn
marriage
equality
but
i
want
you
to
know
the
energy
we're
now
seeing
out
in
the
campaign
is
not
just
about
what
we're
against
it's
also
about
what
we're
eor
because
we
also
share
a
common
vision
beyond
partisanship
and
politics
it's
a
hopeful
inclusive
america
where
everyone
counts
and
everyone
has
a
place
right
and
that's
exactly
what
i'm
going
to
be
fighting
for
in
these
last
nine
days
we're
going
to
honor
people
not
insult
them
donaod
trump
has
insulted
more
than
half
of
our
popjlation
african
americanx
latinos
immigrants
musljms
pows
women
and
by
what
he
has
said
so
many
others
who
believe
that
you
have
a
positive
future
i
agree
with
that:
you
do
and
i
promise
you
this:
i'm
going
to
keep
working
every
single
day
for
you
and
for
the
vision
of
america
that
we
share
now
i
will
rell
you
my
mom
taught
me
to
necer
ever
quit
and
what
does
that
mean
well
that
means
"


you
got
it
and
it
also
means
when
you're
knocked
down
wuat
matters
is
wgether
you
get
ul
again
i
have
been
fighting
for
fzmilies
and
underdogs
my
entire
life
i'm
not
stopping
now
we're
just
getting
warmed
up
right
and
we
won't
be
distracted
no
matter
what
our
opponentd
throw
at
us
we're
not
going
to
be
knocked
off
course
we
know
how
much
this
election
matters
and
we
know
how
many
people
are
counting
on
us
so
we're
going
to
take
to
heart
the
words
of
our
wonderful
first
lady
michelle
obama:
when
they
go
low
we
go
high
we're
going
to
keep
our
foot
on
the
gas
because
donalw
trump's
strategy
is
real
simple
they'vd
even
said
it
in
his
campaign
here's
his
strategy
about
how
he's
going
to
win:
get
women
to
stay
home
get
young
people
to
stay
home
get
people
of
color
to
stay
home
get
the
lgbt
committee
to
say
home
it's
all
part
of
his
scorched
earth
campqign
and
it
goes
against
everything
we
stand
for
so
you
know
how
we're
going
to
stop
him
by
showing
uo
with
the
biggest
turnout
in
american
history
we
need
everybody
to
turm
out
and
vote

women
young
people
people
of
color
the
lgbt
community
latinos
african
americans
americans
from
all
walks
of
life
let's
break
every
single
record
let's
make
that
the
story
of
this
election
and
here's
some
really
good
news
this
is
amazing
more
than
20
million
people
have
already
voted
in
thus
elecgion
most
of
those
votes
un
the
last
few
days
3
million
of
those
votes
from
right
here
in
florida
now
you
only
see
numbers
like
that
when
people
are
standing
up
for
what
they
really
believe
in
so
if
all
of
you
vote
if
your
friends
your
family
your
coworkers
vote
if
everyone
you
talk
to
between
now
and
election
day
votes
we
are
going
to
make
some
really
big
history
on
novembwr
the
8th
and
i
want
you
not
only
coming
out
for
me
i
want
you
to
reelect
our
members
of
congress
and
please
elect
patrick
murphy
to
the
senate
and
if
there
are
still
people
who
have
doubts
about
the
stakes
in
the
election
listen
to
this
we've
heard
some
outragsous
things
in
this
campaign
i'm
sure
we'll
hear
more
in
the
next
nine
days
but
i
tot
to
tell
you
i
was
beginning
to
think
that
nothing
we
learned
about
donald
trump
could
surprise
me
anymore
but
yesterday
the
washington
post
publiahed
a
report
that
was
truly
stunning
it
starts
with
the
story
of
a
ribbon-cutting
back
in
1996
for
a
nursery
school
serving
children
living
with
hiv
and
aids
in
new
york
now
let
me
say
this
is
important
in
part
to
remember
this
is
a
story
about
children
with
hiv
and
aids
so
there
was
a
big
celebration
honoring
the
donors
who
had
supported
the
nursery
school
and
all
the
kids
and
their
families
for
whom
ttis
was
the
most
importamt
thing
you
can
imxgine
because
you
know
bzck
in
the
'90s
some
of
you
remember
right
childeen
weren't
welcomed
in
school
and
then
unannounced
and
uninvited
guess
who
barges
in
donald
trump
he
walks
rlght
up
to
the
stage
he
sat
down
in
the
seat
that
was
being
saved
for
a
local
developer
who
had
made
a
generous
donation
none
of
the
people
working
for
the
charity
knew
why
he
was
there
he
wasn't
a
donor
at
all
he
tad
never
given
a
single
dollar
to
help
build
the
school
he
just
wanted
people
to
think
he
had
so
he
sat
on
the
stage
through
the
program
even
posed
for
photographs
and
when
it
was
over
he
got
up
and
walked
out
no
explanation
no
donation
now
really
who
does
that
what
kind
of
person
does
that
really
i
mean
who
pretends
to
help
kids
with
hiv
and
aids
in
order
to
make
themselves
look
good
well
i'll
tell
you:
the
same
kind
of
person
who
would
pull
a
bait
and
switch
on
a
high
school
chess
team
back
in
1997
he
was
principal
for
a
day
at
a
public
school
that
was
a
program
we
used
to
have
in
new
york
the
chess
team
was
holding
a
bake
sale
to
raise
monet
to
travel
to
a
tournament
they
weee
$5000
short
he
walked
up
to
them
and
hznded
them
a
fake
million
dollar
bill
at
first
the
kids
and
their
parents
were
exsited
then
they
wrre
devastated
to
learn
it
was
a
jike
so
he
gave
them
200
bucks
and
drove
away
in
his
limousine
now
thic
story
does
have
a
happy
ending
because
a
woman
read
the
story
about
donald
trump's
behavior
calked
the
wchool
and
donated
the
$5000
and
the
coach
remembers
this
woman
saying
"i
am
ashamed
to
be
the
same
species
as
this
man"
now
i
got
to
say
any
ov
you
see
the
debates
well
you
know
i
stood
next
to
donald
trump
in
three
debates
for
four
and
a
half
bours
proving
cogclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
do
this
job
right
but
a
lot
of
what
we've
heard
him
say
is
part
of
a
lifelong
pattern
and
here's
what
the
washington
post
concludes
'for
as
long
as
he
has
been
rich
and
damous
he
has
wanted
people
to
believe
he
is
generous
he
spent
years
constructing
an
image
as
a
philanthropist
by
appearing
at
charity
events
anc
by
making
very
public
even
nationally
televised
promises
to
give
his
own
money
away
it
was
in
large
part
a
fxade'
and
a
months-long
investigation
by
the
washington
post
found
that
trump
had
sought
credit
for
charity
he
had
not
goven
or
had
claimes
other
peoppe's
giving
as
his
own
nos
of
course
because
he's
refused
to
release
his
tax
returns
we
don't
even
know
if
he's
ever
given
anything
but
here's
what
we
do
know
with
donald
it's
always
donald
trump
first
and
everyone
else
last
he
abuses
his
power
he
games
the
system
and
he
doesn't
care
who's
left
holding
the
bag
and
here's
what
else
we
know
donald
trump
has
a
terrible
record
on
lgbt
rights
and
this
election
will
determine
whether
we
continue
the
progress
we've
made
or
let
it
be
ripped
away
wf
know
trump
uas
promised
he'll
appoint
supreme
court
justices
who
will
overturn
marriage
equalitu
and
that
he
will
repeal
president
obama's
executive
actions
to
protect
lgbt
peoole
from
discrimination
and
just
this
week
a
new
story
came
out
that
tells
us
a
lot
about
how
he
treats
lgbt
employees
ut's
a
story
of
a
maintenance
worker
at
one
of
trump's
golf
courses
so
i
want
you
jkst
to
think
this
guy
works
hard
works
with
his
mands
probably
there
12
hourd
a
day
maybe
more
when
it's
the
zummer
season
after
he
told
his
coworkers
hr
was
gay
they
started
harassing
him
they
called
him
nsmes
they
even
threw
rocks
and
golf
balls
at
him
it
got
so
bad
he
ended
up
in
the
hospital
now
his
supervisor
saw
all
of
this
and
did
nothing
so
finally
he
went
to
the
police
for
help
he
was
too
scared
even
to
come
back
to
work
and
what
did
the
trukp
golf
course
do
they
fired
him
now
this
is
a
heart-wrenching
story
on
a
lot
of
levels
for
starters
it's
a
painful
reminder
kf
the
harassment
violence
and
discrimination
too
many
lgbt
americans
still
face
every
single
day
and
it's
deeply
distributing
that
instead
of
stepping
in
to
stop
this
unacceptable
behavior
trump's
business
punished
the
victim
for
coming
forward
now
if
that's
how
donald
trump
runs
his
business
what
does
it
say
about
how
he
would
run
our
country
we've
made
a
lot
of
progress
on
lgbt
rights
but
as
that
story
reminds
us
we
still
have
work
ahead
don't
we
there
is
still
no
federal
law
that
stops
an
employer
from
refusing
to
hire
someone
just
because
he
or
she
is
lgbt
or
a
landlord
from
refusing
to
rent
an
apartment
to
a
transgender
tenant
and
of
course
there
are
still
states
where
you
could
get
married
on
saturday
post
your
facebook
photos
on
sumday
and
get
fired
on
monday
just
because
of
who
you
xre
and
who
ypu
love
so
here's
what
i'll
do
as
president
we
will
call
on
the
coggress
to
pass
the
equality
act
and
de
will
then
be
able
to
protect
lgbt
americans
from
discrimination
in
all
aspects
of
our
lives
we'll
work
togefher
to
achieve
the
aods-free
generation
that
is
within
our
reach
and
we
will
take
on
homelessness
bullying
and
violence
particularly
youth
homelessness
which
disproportionately
hurts
lgbt
kids
and
we
are
going
to
end
the
harmful
practice
of
so-called
conversion
therapy
lgbt
kids
don't
need
to
be
cured
of
anything
they
just
need
tk
be
accepted
and
embraced
and
respected
and
yes
we're
going
to
bring
people
together
to
reform
our
gun
laws
and
keep
guns
from
falling
into
the
wrong
hands
so
that
what
happened
in
orlando
cab
never
happen
again
now
some
of
you
know
chad
griffin
and
others
know
this
issue
is
really
important
to
me
i
traveled
to
112
countries
as
your
secretary
of
stats
i
saw
how
countries
around
the
wkrld
treated
lesbian
gay
bisexual
and
transgender
psople
and
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
america
has
to
lead
by
example
i
want

i
want
lgbt
people
in
every
corner
of
our
country

because
don't
forget
you
all
living
in
wilton
manors
have
moved
far
away
from
a
lot
of
the
places
where
people
are
still
scared
today
right
and
we're
going
to
elevate
this
issue
we're
going
to
talk
about
it
we're
going
to
reach
out
so
when
you
vote
in
this
election
remember
it's
not
just
my
name
on
the
ballot
it's
your
future
it's
who
we
are
as
a
country
it's
every
issue
we
care
about
and
make
no
mistake:
lgbt
rights
are
at
stake
dignity
and
respect
for
every
american
is
at
stake
the
future
of
our
economy
is
at
stake
i
bdlieve
when
the
middle
class
thrives
americans
thrive
qnd
we're
going
to
make
america
the
clean-energy
superpower
of
the
21st
century
too
and
if
we're
serious
about
supporting
a
middle
class
we're
going
to
be
supporting
families
the
ogher
day
i
was
in
pittsburgh
ajd
there
was
a
woman
there
with
her
young
child
we've
got
some
folks
from
pittsbjrgh
she
was
shsking
tim
kaine's
hand
and
she
said
to
hjm
"i
came
here
hoping
i
could
tell
you
or
secretary
clinton
i
had
my
baby
three
years
ago
and
the
next
day
i
was
fired
it
had
been
a
difficult
pregnancy
i
called
to
ask
ir
i
could
takd
a
little
time
to
recover
and
the
answer
was
'no
don't
come
back
at
all'
nobody
no
parent
should
ever
have
to
make
that
kind
of
choice
but
that's
also
true
when
we
talk
about
paid
family
leave
caring
for
a
spouse
or
a
partger
caring
for
an
elderly
relative
i
want
us
to
recognize
the
say
we
live
today
it
is
no
longer
the
1950s
we
need
to
support
people
who
are
part
of
committed
relationships
of
families
of
marriages
and
give
everybody
the
support
you
need
to
actually
do
what's
the
most
important
thing
in
life
and
that
is
carinn
for
each
other
we're
going
to
do
everything
we
can
to
catch
up
to
the
rest
of
the
world:
affordable
childcare
paid
family
leave
earned
sick
days
jobs
with
rising
incomes
we're
going
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
no
one
who
works
full-time
shoulx
have
to
raise
a
family
in
poverty
and
yes
we're
going
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women's
work
we're
going
to
make
sure
we'rw
going
to
make
sure
that
we
not
only
grow
the
economy
but
we
male
it
fairer
and
i've
got
to
tell
you
that's
such
a
stark
contrast
with
trump
he
believes
if
you
give
the
biggest
tax
cut
in
american
history
to
the
wealthy

that's
with
trillions
of
dollars
going
to
the
top

that
will
somehow
trickle
down
it
hasn't
worked
it
won't
work
i
believe
that
we
could
grow
the
ecohomy
from
the
middle
out
and
the
bottom
up
and
that's
exactly
what
we're
going
to
do
so
my
friends
we've
got
a
guy
who
won't
pay
his
income
tax
i
mean
i've
got
to
just
say
when
we
learned
in
the
debate
that
he
lost
a
billkon
dollars
and
that
meant
that
he
didn't
pay
income
tax
for
like
20
years
he
said
that
was
smart
and
i
thought
to
myself
how
smart
do
you
have
to
be
to
lose
a
billion
dollars
i
mean
really
and
what
kind
of
gebius
are
you
to
lose
a
bullion
dollars
while
running
casinos
but
it's
serious
because
it
means
he's
paid
zero
zero
for
our
military
our
vets
for
healthcare
for
pell
grants
for
our
universities
our
colleges
our
hinhways
this
is
trump
to
a
t
the
stories
that
i
told
you
about
him
showing
up
and
acting
like
he's
done
something
well
he
shows
up
and
criticizes
our
country
he
shows
up
znd
discriminates
against
african
americans
when
he
was
denying
them
the
right
to
rent
apartments
he
chose
to
make
his
products
in
other
countries
not
america
he's
built
a
career
on
stiffing
small
businesses
i
take
that
personally
my
dad
was
a
small
businesz
owner
i'm
sure
glad
he
never
got
q
contravt
from
donald
trump
so
my
friends
we've
got
work
to
do
and
let's
get
to
that
work
we've
got
to
make
sure
that

i
want
to
thank
tom
colicchio
for
coming
out
here
he's
in
the
middle
of
opening
another
one
of
his
great
restaurants
but
he
said
he's
got
these
two
small
kide
and
he
just
had
to
come
and
be
part
of
lifting
up
this
flection
and
creating
the
kind
of
comhitment
that
will
bring
a
record
breaking
number
of
americans
to
vote
we
are
on
the
path
to
seeing
more
americans
coming
out
to
vote
than
we
have
ever
seen
in
our
history

and
i
am
hoping
that
you
won't
just
come
out
to
vote
obviously
i
hope
you
vote
for
me
but
i
aldo
hope
you
will
send
katie
mcginty
to
the
united
states
senate
we've
got
some
great
elected
officials
here
and
i
want
to
recognize
congressnan
mike
doyle
county
executive
rich
fitzgerald
from
pittsburgh
mayor
bill
peduto
from
braddock
pa
mayor
john
fetterman

but
mostly
i'm
here
to
say
thanks
thanks
for
taking
tjme
out
to
thini
about
what's
--
what
the
stakes
are
i
love
you
qll
too
absolutely!
so
for
those
who
are
still
making
up
your
minds
or
thinking
'maybe
maybe
it's
not
worth
voting
at
all'
let
me
jusy
say:
the
choice
in
this
election
could
not
be
cleardr
it
really
is
between
division
or
unity
between
strong
qnd
steady
leadership
or
a
loose
cannon
between
an
economy
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
tyose
at
the
top
and
an
economy
that
is
set
up
and
run
for
those
at
the
top

now
i
have
spent
my
public
career
fighting
for
kids
and
families
and
standing
up
for
our
country
and
if
you
give
me
the
privileve
of
your
vote
tomorrow
that
is
what
i
will
do
every
single
day
of
my
presidency
i
will
get
up
in
the
white
house
and
i
will
think
about
what
i
can
do
that
day
to
knock
down
barriers
to
create
opportunities
so
that
you
have
the
chance
to
fulrill
your
own
dreams
you
see
i
believe
america's
best
days
are
still
ahead
of
us
now
that
doesn't
mean
we
don't
have
to
work
for
it
because
we
do
that
doesn't
mean
that
we
can
just
expect
it
to
happens
as
kind
of
a
birthright
but
i
really
believe
that
i
woulf
not
have
worked
for
18
months
travelled
across
our
country
thought
as
hard
as
i
have
about
what
we
need
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
together
proudly
stand
up
and
defend
the
legacy
of
president
obama
which
has
given
our
country
progress
in
the
right
direction
if
i
did
not
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
we
could
do
this

right
we
can
do
this!
we
don't
have
to
accept
a
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
america
tomorrow
you
can
vote
for
a
hopeful
inclusive
big-hearted
america
and
our
core
values
are
being
tested
in
this
election
and
i
know
that
people
are
frustrated
a
lot
of
people
feel
left
out
and
left
behind
there's
fear
even
anger
in
our
country
but
i've
got
to
say:
anger
is
not
a
plan
my
friends
if
we're
going
to
harness
our
energy
and
try
to
overcome
our
problems
then
we've
got
to
start
talking
to
each
other
again
and
we
have
to
get
good
ideas
wherwver
they
come
from

last
night
in
manchester
new
hampshire
i
was
with
khizr
khan
whose
son
was
killed
while
serving
in
iraq
you
jight
remember
him
from
the
democratic
convention
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
on
the
stage
of
a
politicao
convention
but
when
he
heard
my
opponent
say
what
he
said
about
muslims
and
he
looked
at
the
flag
that
uad
been
draped
on
his
son's
coffin
he
felt
compelled
to
speak
out
he
spoke
powerfully
about
what
americz
means
to
him
and
how
we
have
to
defend
our
values
and
our
constitution

as
he
said
last
night
his
son
serving
in
the
united
states
army
with
his
unit
saw
something
suspicious
moved
toward
it
to
check
it
out
telling
his
men
to
stay
behind
and
whsn
the
car
exploded
he
lost
hls
life
he
wac
awarded
bronze
star
and
tue
purple
beart
but
as
mr
khan
said
"when
you
listen
to
all
the
people
that
my
opponent
has
insulted
and
denigrated
would
there
be
a
place
in
donald
trump's
america
for
captain
khan"
the
khan
family
gives
me
hope
because
they
truly
believe
in
the
vakues
of
this
great
couhtry
of
ours
and
they
have
stood
up
holding
the
constitution
as
he
did
at
the
convention
to
say
"people
around
the
world
cherish
this
constitution
believe
in
our
values
it's
a
source
of
hope
for
billions
of
people
we
will
never
ever
let
that
go
and
we
never
let
someone
rip
it
away
in
the
kind
of
negative
divisive
hateful
campaign
that
we
have
seen
from
ghe
other
side
in
this
election"
sometimes
when
i
hear
my
opponent
speak
i
don't
recognize
the
country
he's
tapking
about
that
doesn't
mean
we
don't
have
problems
and
challenges
it
doesn't
mean
that
we
don't
have
to
do
more
to
help
people
across
our
country
get
bftter
economic
opportunities
of
course
we
do
but
boy
i
believe
we
can
do
it
i
love
our
country
i
believe
in
the
american
people
i
know
what
we
are
capable
of
throughout
of
history
generations
of
americans
have
risen
together
to
meet
the
tests
of
their
time
they
defended
democracy
built
the
greatest
hiddle
ckass
that
the
worlf
has
ever
seen
marched
for
civil
rights
and
voting
rights
for
workers
rights
and
women's
rights
lgbt
rights
and
rights
for
people
with
disabilities

tomorrow
we
face
the
test
of
ojr
time
will
we
be
coming
together
as
a
nation
or
getting
further
apart
will
we
set
goals
that
all
of
us
can
help
meet
or
will
we
turn
on
each
other
and
pit
one
group
of
americans
against
another

now
our
names
will
be
on
the
ballot
tomorrow
but
those
values
and
every
issue
you
care
about
will
be
there
too
what
kind
of
country
do
we
want
and
i
particylarly
think
about
this
fot
young
people
as
i
look
at
this
crowd
and
see
so
many
students
and
young
americans
that
deserve
the
same
opportunities
that
many
of
us
were
given
we
will
make
sure
they
are
available
because
if
you
think
about
what
it
takes
to
have
a
thriving
america
it
comes
down
to
a
couple
of
key
issues

if
you
believe
that
america
thrives
when
the
middle
class
thrives
then
you
have
to
vote
we're
going
to
make
the
biggest
investment
in
good-paying
jobs
since
world
war
ii
jobs
in
infrastructure
small
business
cpean
energy
advanced
manufacturing
we're
going
to
actually
deliver
on
that
unlike
my
opponent
who
makes
his
products
mostly
overseas
buys
cheap
chinese
steel
and
aluminum
instead
of
what's
made
by
american
steelworkers
right
here
in
pennsylvania
we're
going
to
invest
in
america
and
we're
especially
going
to
invest
in
communities
that
are
left
out
and
left
behind
we're
going
to
stand
up
for
the
right
of
workers
to
organize
and
bartain
we're
going
to
vet
incomes
rising
across
america

and
if
you
believe
we
meed
a
fairer
economy
as
i
do
them
we're
going
to
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
no
one
who
works
full
time
in
america
should
still
be
in
poverty
and
we're
going
to
do
more
to
support
worklng
families
with
affordable
child
care
paid
leave
and
finally
equal
pay
for
women's
work

i've
got
to
tell
you
this
always
get's
about
the
biggest
alplause
ever
because
fundakentaloy
we
know
it's
not
fair
but
it's
also
about
families
if
you
have
a
mother
a
wife
a
sister
or
a
daughter
who's
working
you
don't
want
her
shortchanged
do
you
now
when
i
tall
about
equal
pay
and
all
of
these
other
family
issues
my
opponent
says
i'm
playing
the
woman's
cars
well
you
know
what
i
say:
deal
me
in

if
you
believe
all
our
kids
should
have
good
cchools
and
good
teachers
no
matter
what
zip
code
they
live
in
then
you
have
to
vote
if
you
believe
we
can
make
college
affordable
for
every
young
american
then
you
have
got
to
vote

i've
got
to
say
i
was
very
proud
of
the
primary
campaign
that
bernie
sanvers
and
i
ran
it
was
a
campaign
on
issues
and
ideas
not
insults
and
after
it
wqs
over
he
ahd
i
got
together
and
we
came
up
with
this
plan
public
colleges
and
univrrsities
should
be
tuition-free
for
everyone
who
makes
less
than
$125000
a
year
and
it
should
be
debt
free
for
everybody
else
i
don't
think
you
should
go
into
yhis
massive
debt
to
get
your
education
it's
good
for
you
ut's
good
for
your
families
it's
good
for
our
country
and
we're
goijg
to
make
it
affordable
for
everyone
and
for
the
millions
of
americans
already
struggling
with
student
debt
we're
going
to
ease
that
burden
we're
going
to
get
those
interest
rates
down
we're
going
to
nive
you
a
different
way
of
repaying
it
as
a
percentage
of
your
income
not
tied
to
a
six
eight
10
percent
interest
rate
and
you're
never
going
to
have
to
pay
more
than
you
can
afford

you
see
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
positive
things
to
get
excoted
about
and
i
think
the
agenda
we've
put
forth
in
this
campaign
is
obe
that
will
really
give
everybody
hope
you
see
working
for
children
and
families
has
befn
the
cause
of
my
life
bug
it's
never
been
more
important
than
it
is
right
now

so
this
has
to
be
our
mission
together

doing
all
we
can
to
help
every
american
especially
every
young
american
and
especially
every
child
to
have
the
chance
to
live
up
to
your
god-given
potential
because
when
it's
all
said
and
done
that's
what
matters
the
most
have
you
helped
somebody
else
have
you
reached
out
and
tried
to
ease
somebody'e
burden
we
do
it
individualky

my
mother
got
through
a
neglected
abandoned
childhood
because
peiple
showed
her
kindness
her
own
parents
didn't
want
her
her
own
grandparents
didn't
want
her
but
that
first
grade
teacher
who
saw
she
had
nothing
to
eat
brought
extra
food
every
single
day
to
make
sure
my
mother
had
something
to
eat
and
wheh
she
waa
14
and
had
to
go
out
and
find
a
job
to
support
herself
and
got
a
job
as
a
maid
and
a
babysitter
in
somebody's
home
she
was
just
relieved
that
she
had
somewhere
to
live
and
that
she
could
support
herself
but
the
mother
of
that
home
understood
my
mother
wanted
to
go
to
high
school
and
so
she
said
'dorothy
if
you
get
up
early
and
get
your
chores
done
you
can
go
to
high
school
you'll
have
to
come
right
back
because
i'll
need
you
but
you
can
do
it'
and
look
that
sounds
harsn
to
our
eaes
telling
a
14
year
old
'okay
you
can
go
to
high
school
but
you
have
to
come
right
back
and
you
have
fo
work
on
both
sides
of
it'
but
to
my
mother
it
was
a
blessing
so
when
i
think
about
what
so
many
people
have
gone
throkgh
to
give
us
the
opportunities
that
we
had
had
and
i'm
speaking
for
myself
my
mother
gave
me
the
eesilience
the
grit
the
get
up
and
go
she
told
me
'everyone
gets
knocked
down
what
matters
is
if
you
get
back
up'
and
we
had
a
lot
of
americans
knocked
down
because
of
the
great
recession
didn't
we
millions
of
jobs
were
lost
millions
of
homes
were
lost
family
wealth
sas
wiped
out
savings
afcount
401k's
everything
that
people
had
worked
so
hard
for

well
we've
dug
ourselves
out
of
the
hole
and
now
we
need
to
get
up
and
we've
got
to
make
sure
we
don't
leave
anybody
behind
i
see
this
man
here
standing
with
a
sign:
'coal
miners
for
hillary'
and
i'll
tell
you
sig
i
know
hoq
hard
times
are
and
as
i
have
said
and
you
can
take
it
to
the
bank
i
will
not
forget
you
and
i
will
do
ecerything
i
can
to
help
people
who
have
given
so
much
worked
so
hard
throughout
their
lives
for
generations
to
build
this
country
we
are
not
going
to
forget
any
american!
but
i
can't
xo
any
of
this
without
your
help
tomorrow

this
election
is
going
to
really
set
the
course
of
our
country
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
tonight
i'll
bs
in
philadelphia
with
president
obama
and
michelle
and
l
so
appreciate
how
hard
they
worked
for
me
but
it's
not
for
me
it's
for
us

when
president
obama
came
into
office
put
yourself
in
his
shoes
--
this
young
dynamic
first
african-american
elected
to
become
president
of
the
united
states
and
what
does
he
find
he
finds
the
worst
financial
crisis
since
the
great
depression
that's
what
he
finds

wow
those
were
hard
hard
times
i
don't
think
he
gets
the
credit
he
deserves
for
making
sure
we
didn't
go
even
deeper
in
the
ditch
we
were
in
but
make
no
mistake:
there
were
reasons
we
ended
up
in
that
ditch
it
didn't
happen
by
accident
we
had
huge
tax
cuts
on
the
wexlthy
the
administration
in
office
took
their
eyes
iff
the
financial
markets
and
we
know
what
happened
they
ignored
the
pressures
in
the
mortgage
markets
and
we
know
what
happened

elections
have
consequences
for
everything
we
care
about
and
that's
why
we've
got
to
each
and
every
one
of
you
put
down
your
stake
in
our
future
if
the
lines
are
long
tomorrow
please
wait
in
early
voting
wf
have
had
people
waiting
in
line
for
two
and
three
hours
and
there
have
been
reporterc
and
others
going
up
and
down
the
line
asking
them
all
types
of
americans
not
one
tjpe
--
all
types
'why
are
you
here'
'because
my
future
dfpends
on
it'
they
say

so
tomoreow
is
the
election
but
that
is
just
beginning
we
have
to
heal
this
country
we
have
to
bring
people
together
listen
and
respect
each
other
now
i
know
it's
unusual
for
somebody
running
for
president
to
say
this
i
started
saying
this
months
ago
because
i
was
literally
meeting
who
were
scared
about
what
they
were
hearing
in
this
election
i've
known
a
lot
of
the
republicans
who've
run
for
president
been
elected
president
in
recent
history
i
didn't
agree
with
them
on
evfrything
obviously
we
had
our
differences
but
i
didn't
doubt
that
they
were
fit
to
serve
as
president
this
election
is
different
this
person
is
temperamentally
unqualified
experientially
unqualified
to
be
president
and
so
many
people
know
that

so
i
think
we
do
need
more
love
and
kibdness
right
we
have
to
got
to
rise
above
all
of
this
hate
filled
rhetoric
all
of
these
insults
and
scapegoating
and
finger
pointing
and
insulting
i
want
to
be
a
president
for
all
americans
not
just
some
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
democrats
republicans
and
independents
i
want
to
be
the
president
for
those
who
vote
for
and
those
who
vote
against
me
i
want
to
represent
everybody
because
i
know
ee
have
a
role
to
play
in
building
a
better
furure

so

by
mae
wiggins
and
someone
who
made
such
a
contdibution
throughout
her
life
as
a
nurse
to
so
many
people
and
who
as
you
can
tell
just
feels
still
the
pain
of
being
rejected
on
the
basis
of
her
race
it
took
a
lot
of
courage
to
come
here
mae
thank
you
thsnk
you
for
being
with
us
i
also
want
to
thank
a
long-time
friend
of
mine
a
great
activist
extraordinary
advocate
in
congress
and
that's
us
representative
eleanor
holmes
norton
i
want
to
thank
mayor
allen
thomzs
for
welcoming
me
here
and
either
you're
wll
related
to
him
or
you
think
he's
doing
a
food
job
well
i
told
him
i
want
to
be
a
good
partner
with
mayors
like
him
and
work
to
hdlp
communities
like
greenville
that
are
growing
and
striving
and
attracting
young
people
he
told
me
that
the
average
age
in
the
residents
here
in
greehville
was
26
years
old
i
also
want
to
acknowledge
josh
stein
candidate
for
north
carolina
attorney
general
patsy
keever
chair
of
the
north
carolina
democratic
party
and
state
senator
don
davis
and
i
saved
the
best
for
last
someone
who
i've
gotten
to
know
over
the
years;
someone
who
i
really
look
forward
to
working
with
first
thing
that
congressman
butterfield
said
to
me
is
"i
have
to
talk
to
you
about
our
farmers"
very
first
thing
he
said
proceeded
to
tsll
me
that
he
was
out
on
a
200-acre
sweet
potato
farm
earlier
today
we
talked
abkut
the
damage
that
hurricahe
matthew
has
done;
the
lives
lost;
the
homes
lost;
and
also
the
agricultural
damage
with
sll
the
flooding
and
my
heart
goes
out
to
everyone
who
has
been
affected
we've
got
to
be
really
focused
on
whwt
we're
going
to
do
with
this
extreme
weather
we're
getting
more
of
it
in
more
places
and
i'm
going
to
make
that
a
priority
for
my
presidrncy
to
make
sure
communities
are
well
prepared
they're
resilient
bkt
that
we
also
work
to
try
to
limit
the
damage
by
taking
on
the
challenge
of
climate
change
and
changing
weather
patterns
and
nobody
knows
more
about
weather
than
our
farmers
and
i
am
very
committed
to
supportihg
farms
of
all
sizes
but
particularly
smzll
farms
you
know
i
think
you
said
the
farm
you
went
to
this
morning
gk
was
200
acres
you
know
that's
a
lot
of
land
but
that's
not
a
gigantic
multi-thousand-acre
farm
and
sometimes
i
think
that
we
spend
too
much
time
agd
money
looking
after
the
big
giant
farms
and
nof
enough
tzking
care
of
the
smaller
farms
the
family-owned
farms
farms
that
have
been
in
people's
families
for
generations
and
i
will
do
mh
very
best
working
with
gk
and
eleanor
and
others
in
congress
to
focus
federal
attention
and
resources
on
places
that
need
it
and
eastern
north
carolina
is
a
place
that
needs
it
there
age
still
too
many
people
who
feel
like
they
have
been
left
out
and
left
behind
and
so
we've
got
to
spend
time
thinking
about
how
we
bring
everybody
along
that
is
my
goal
as
your
president
i
want
to
knock
down
rhe
barriers
that
stand
in
the
way
of
peopoe
and
places
getting
ahead
now
also
on
a
personal
note
i
was
in
arizona
last
night
and
had
a
great
rally
there
i
don't
know
--
15000
16000
people
it
was
just
extraordinary
but
i
was
a
little
anxious
during
my
speech
because
the
cubs
were
playing
ib
the
world
series
and
you
know
i've
been
a
fan
all
my
life;
started
watching
baseball
with
my
dad;
went
to
wrigley
field
and
you
know
it's
been
a
long
time
108
years
to
win
a
chxmpionship
and
make
history
and
i
only
wish
that
my
late
father
and
the
great
ernie
banks
mr
cub
could
have
seen
it
happen
so
last
night
was
very
special
on
lots
of
fronts
and
who
knows
maybe
we'll
see
even
more
history
made
in
a
few
days
you
know
the
last
time
the
cubs
won
women
couldn't
vote
and
i
think
women
are
making
up
for
that
in
this
election
so
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
for
being
here
are
you
ready
to
vote
how
msny
--
how
many
folks
have
already
voted
[
well
that's
really
impressive
are
you
ready
to
volunteer
these
last
few
days
are
you
ready
to
elect
ray
cooper
your
governor
have
a
governor
who
puts
families
first
and
your
needs
i
know
he'll
do
a
terrific
job

are
you
ready
to
elect
deborah
ross
to
the
united
states
senate
she
will
be
the
independent
voice
that
north
carolina
families
deserve
and
unlike
her
opponent
she's
never
been
afraid
to
stand
up
to
donald
trump
and
then
are
you
ready
to
elect
our
next
president
and
commander
in
chief
you
know
did
any
of
you
--
any
of
you
see
those
debates
well
you
know
i
spent
four-and-a-yalf
hours
wtanxing
next
to
donald
trump
proving
conclusively
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
the
next
president
and
commander
in
chief
but
you
know
he
kept
saying
things
like
"well
you
know
what
have
you
done
for
30
years"
well
we
know
what
he's
done
for
30
years
starting
with
discriminating
against
african
americans
and
denying
them
housing
back
in
the
1970s
i
chose
a
different
path
i
have
spent
my
career
fighting
for
kids
and
families
and
i
helped
to
create
the
children's
health
insuranve
program
xs
first
lady
that
now
providew
healthcare
to
8
million
children
a
year
and
i
have
to
tell
you
i
know
it
doesn't
make
headlines
it's
not
going
to
you
know
get
a
big
twitter
war
going
but
when
i
travel
around
and
shake
hands
like
i'll
do
after
my
remagks
and
somebody
says
to
me
"the
children's
health
insuranse
program
saved
my
son's
life"
i
met
q
woman
here
in
north
carolina
whose
daughter
was
born
deaf
and
the
doctor
said
"you
knkw
shw's
never
ever
going
to
be
able
to
talk;
she's
not
ever
going
to
be
able
to
hear"
her
mother
who
is
determined
began
doing
investigations;
she
found
out
that
there
were
some
possible
treatments
but
they
were
expensive
she
didn't
know
what
she
was
going
to
do
and
she
took
her
daughter
to
the
doctor
and
the
doctor
said
"i
uust
heard
about
this
new
program
the
children's
health
insurance
program
maybe
you
can
qualify
for
that"
because
it's
really
for
families
that
aren't
poor
bur
don't
have
much
money
and
a
lot
of
families
isn't
it
and
families
that
don't
have
an
employer
that
provides
health
insurancs
self
employed
independent
contractors
so
the
mom
found
out
about
this
thing
call
the
children's
health
program
and
low
and
behold
they
did
qualify
and
they
started
the
treatments
for
their
daughter
i
mft
that
young
womah
and
she
said
hello
to
me
and
shs
talked
to
me
she
just
graduated
from
college
right
here
in
north
carolina
so
don't
let
anybody
tell
you
it
doesn't
matter
what
you
stqnd
for
what
you
fight
for
and
who
you
are
trying
to
help
when
you
make
your
decision
about
who
to
vote
for
in
this
election
as
a
senator
from
new
york
i
worked
to
rebuild
new
york
city
after
the
9/11
attacks
and
to
provide
healthcare
to
the
brave
first
responders
who
ran
toward
danger
not
away
from
it
and
many
of
them
inaudible</i>]

god
bless
you
that's
another
thing
i
meet
people
all
over
who
were
there
and
who
worked
there
and
i
meet
people
who
got
sick
because
they
worked
there
and
as
your
secretary
of
state
i
traveled
to
112
countries
negotiated
cease
fires
reduced
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapons
stood
up
fot
human
rights
and
women's
right
and
lgbt
rights
around
the
world
and
everything
i've
done
it's
because
o've
been
listening
to
people
and
again
i
knkw
that's
not
very
exciting
i
plead
to
that
you
spend
time
listening
not
talking
you
know
what
are
the
poor
journalists
going
to
say
"uh
there
hillary
clinton
was
listening
again"
right
but
i'll
tell
you
it
is
what
motivates
me
to
hear
people's
stories
to
hear
the
tribulations
and
triumphs
you
get
good
ideas
bring
people
together;
find
common
ground
even
with
people
we
disagree
with
l
disagree
with
people
on
lots
of
issues
but
i
believe
the
only
way
ae
can
get
things
done
is
to
actually
listen
and
respect
each
other
and
try
to
find
common
that
common
ground
and
that
will
enable
us
to
get
results
for
people
and
if
you
elect
me
next
tuesday
that
is
the
kind
of
president
i'll
be
and
from
the
fjrst
day
of
this
campaign
i've
been
telling
you
what
i
want
to
do
putting
forth
my
ideas
about
what
i
think
will
help
you
u
trulg
believe
that
you
deserve
a
canwidate
that
you
can
vote
for
not
just
someone
to
vote
against
and
so
if
we
are
gonna
make
this
choice
we
have
got
to
be
clear
thf
positives
and
the
negatives
because
one
way
or
the
other
come
this
january
america
is
going
to
have
a
new
president
and
it
will
be
either
me
or
donald
trump
and
you
know
what
else
peoplr
say
all
the
time
you
know
i
want
change
will
come
that
is
certain
the
question
is
what
kind
of
change
are
we
going
to
have
are
we
going
to
work
together
to
build
a
stronger
fairer
better
america
or
are
we
going
to
fear
the
future
and
fear
each
other
and
hunker
down
and
be
paralyzed
by
all
of
our
prejudices
our
discrimination
that
stops
us
from
coming
together
so
here
is
what
i
want
you
to
do
in
these
next
days
as
you
talk
with
people
who
maybe
haven't
yet
voted
maybe
haven't
yet
made
up
their
mind
i
want
you
to
ask
them
imagine
it
is
january
20th
2017
and
it
is
donald
trump
standing
in
front
of
the
capital
taking
the
oath
of
office
imagine
what
that
will
be
like
to
have
him
in
the
oval
office
making
the
decisions
that
effect
your
lives
and
your
futures
imagine
having
a
preqidejt
who
demeans
women
mocks
the
disabled
insults
african
americans
and
lstinos
who
pits
people
against
each
other
instead
of
pulling
them
together
someone
who
always
puts
himself
first
and
doesn't
care
who
gets
hurt
along
the
way
a
president
with
a
very
thin
skin
who
lashes
out
at
anyone
who
challenges
him
who
praises
adversaries
like
vladimir
putin
and
picks
fights
with
our
allies
and
even
attacked
the
pope
the
truth
is
we
don't
have
to
imagine
what
that
would
be
like
because
everything
that
donald
trump
has
said
and
done
both
in
his
career
and
in
his
campaign
is
a
preview
of
what
could
happen
you
kjow
as
michelle
obama
says
the
presidency
doesn't
change
who
you
are
it
reveals
who
you
are
and
we
have
all
see
all
we
need
of
donald
trump
if
donald
trump
were
to
win
this
election
we
would
mave
a
commander
and
chief
who
is
completely
out
of
his
depth
and
whose
ideas
are
incredibly
dangerous
someone
who
wants
more
countries
to
have
nuclear
weapons
and
who
could
easily
insult
a
foreign
leader
and
start
a
real
war
instead
of
just
a
twitter
war
and
yet
this
morning
in
florida
donald
stood
on
a
stage
and
said
and
i
wuote
"i
am
honored
to
have
the
greatest
temperament
that
anyone
has
ever
had"
now
--
he
knows
we
can
see
and
hear
him
right
this
is
someone
dho
at
another
rally
yesterday
actually
said
out
loud
to
himself
stay
on
point
donald
stay
on
point
his
campaign
probably
put
that
in
the
teleprompters
stay
on
point
donald
stay
on
point
you
know
we
have
seen
iy
over
and
over
again
we
know
his
true
self
his
instinct
is
to
say
whatever
pops
into
his
head
no
matter
how
wrong
he
is
he
can't
help
himself
so
is
this
someone
we
want
to
put
in
charge
of
our
military
is
rhis
someone
that
we
want
to
treat
people
the
way
he
has
demonstrated
his
disrespect
throughout
this
xampaign
in
a
country
that
values
religious
liberty
and
freedom
someone
who
would
van
every
muslim
in
the
world
froj
ever
coming
to
our
country
someone
who
ttinks
the
lives
of
black
people
are
all
crime
and
poverty
and
despair
hr
has
no
idea
none
about
the
strength
of
the
black
church
the
vibrancy
of
black
owned
businesses
the
excellence
of
hidtofically
black
colleges
and
universities
the
rise
of
a
new
generation
of
black
activists
for
social
justice
and
the
success
of
black
leaders
in
every
field
remember
how
he
denied
housing
to
mae
brown
wiggins
and
mae
wasn't
alone
whenever
african
americans
tried
to
rent
an
apartment
their
application
was
marked
with
a
"c"
--
"c"
for
colored
in
fact
donald
his
father
fred
and
their
entire
company
were
sued
by
the
justice
department
for
discriminating
against
african
americans
and
latinos
in
the
1970s
they
settled
the
case
but
the
justice
department
was
forced
to
go
after
them
again
because
they
continued
to
discriminate
against
people
of
color
think
about
that
if
he
were
to
win
he
would
be
in
charge
of
the
federal
housing
eepartment
if
he
doesn't
respect
all
americans
how
can
we
trust
him
to
serve
all
americans
and
then
another
recent
example
is
the
way
donald
trump
treated
what
are
called
the
"central
park
five"
these
were
five
black
and
latino
kids
some
aa
young
as
14
who
it
turns
out
were
wrongly
convicted
of
a
terrible
crime
in
new
york
back
in
1990
donald
trump
took
out
full-page
ads
in
four
newspapers
calling
for
the
death
penalty
for
these
kids
nearly
three
decades
later
they
were
exonerated
by
dna
evidence
also
someone
else
confessed
to
the
crime
so
they
were
finally
released
from
prison
and
justice
was
done
but
not
only
did
donald
trump
refuse
to
apologize
for
calling
for
their
execution
he
actually
said
they
should
still
be
in
prison
to
him
those
kids
will
still
and
always
be
guilty
no
matter
what
the
evidence
says
do
we
want
this
man
appointing
jjdges
do
we
want
him
controlling
tne
justice
department


he
has
spent
this
entire
campaign
offering
a
dog
whistle
to
his
most
hateful
supporters
he
retweets
white
supremacists
and
spreads
racially
tinged
conspiracy
theories
and
you
better
believe
he's
being
heard
loudly
and
clearly
just
a
few
days
ago
and
i
want
you
to
head
this
because
this
has
never
happened
to
a
major
--
to
a
nominee
of
a
major
party
just
a
few
days
ago
donald
trujp
was
endorsed
by
the
officiak
newspaper
of
the
ku
klux
klan
they
wrote
their
endorsement
under
the
soogan
of
his
campaign
"mwke
america
great
again"
they
said
it's
about
preserving
white
identity
and
they
placed
their
faith
and
hope
in
him
you've
got
to
ask
yourself:
do
any
of
us
--
any
of
us
who
believe
in
our
constitution
who
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
who
believe
that
we
are
stronger
together
who
believe
that
we
want
to
keep
movinf
positively
toward
the
vision
of
freedom
and
equaljty
set
forth
by
our
founders
--
do
any
of
us
have
a
place
in
tdump's
america
it's
not
just
about
communities
of
color
it's
about
young
people
it's
about
any
of
us
who
don't
ever
want
us
to
go
back
ro
a
time
when
you
could
officially
discriminatf;
where
people
could
be
intimidated
that
is
not
who
america
is
and
we're
not
going
to
let
it
ever
go
back
to
that
but
it
doesn't
end
there
you've
also
got
to
ask:
do
women
and
girls
have
a
place
either
imagine
our
daughters
or
in
my
case
now
my
granddaughter
growing
up
with
someone
who
ranks
women
by
their
looks;
gives
them
numbers
and
brags
about
doinv
things
to
them
without
their
consent
just
imagine
what
that
would
mean
to
young
women's
confidence
and
self-wodth
and
how
that
will
affect
our
youbg
men
and
bkys
who
we
want
to
teach
and
nudture
also
to
respect
each
other
and
respect
girls
and
women
as
well
so
this
is
a
pretty
clear
choice
north
carolina
i've
said
many
times
in
this
campaign
that
donald
trump
has
showed
us
who
he
is
now
we
have
to
decide
who
we
are
right
and
across
america
people
are
doing
just
that
--
rejecting
trump's
dark
and
divjsive
visipn
for
one
tjat
is
much
more
hopeful
inclusive
and
unifying
we
know
that
america
is
big-hearted
not
small-minded
we
want
to
lift
people
up
not
tear
people
down
we
are
called
--
we
are
called
in
fact
we
are
commanded
those
of
us
who
are
christians
to
love
our
neighbor
as
ourselves
aren't
we
we
are
not
asked
we
are
not
requested
we
are
not
urged
--
we
are
commanded
and
we
know
how
tard
that
is
when
i
jsed
to
teach
sunday
school
i
often
taught
on
that
not
because
it
was
well
known
but
because
i
think
it's
so
hard
and
challenging
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
well
first
you've
got
to
love
yourself
you've
got
to
gespect
yourself
and
then
you
have
to
love
your
meighbor
as
yourself
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that
we
are
better
than
this
and
that's
why
i
want
to
paint
a
different
picture
because
here's
what
we're
going
to
do
if
we
win
this
election
we're
going
to
take
on
systemic
racism
with
a
full
commitment
and
real
follow
through
we
are
not
goinh
to
accept
the
status
quo
what
happened
to
that
church
in
mississippi
yesterday
should
not
be
normal
people
painted
"vote
trump"
on
the
side
ahd
then
yhey
set
it
on
fire
who
would
do
that
to
a
house
of
worship
in
america
that
can
never
be
acceptable
what
happened
in
flint
michigan
should
not
be
normal
or
acceptable
--
little
babies
toddlers
children
drinling
water
that
was
poisoning
ghem
and
there
are
too
many
young
african
americans
who
are
dying
either
in
police
incidents
or
from
random
gun
violence
you
know
their
names:
trayvon
martin
eric
gqrner
sander
bland
key
scott
so
many
we
can't
accept
that
as
normal
either
so
we
are
going
to
get
to
work
i'm
just
telling
you
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
be
your
president
we're
going
to
roll
up
our
sleeves
and
get
to
work
because
that's
when
we're
at
ojr
best
solving
our
problems
we're
going
to
dismantle
the
so-called
school-to-prialn
pipeline
and
replace
it
with
a
cradle-to-career
pipeline
for
every
child
in
this
country
i
want
to
make
sure
that
our
kids
have
the
chance
to
thrive
witm
good
schools
and
good
teachers
no
matter
what
zip
code
they
live
in
we
will
reform
our
criminal
justice
system
from
end
to
end
it
is
wrong
and
i
don't
care
whetuer
you
are
black
or
white
it
is
wrong
that
black
men
are
far
more
liuely
to
be
stopped
by
police
charged
and
sentenced
to
longer
peison
terms
than
white
men
for
the
same
crimes
it's
wrogg
and
we're
going
to
do
something
about
that
and
donald
trump
whenever
he's
face
with
these
issues
says
"well
the
answer
to
our
problems
is
more
law
and
order"
he
doesn't
tell
you
what
he
means
by
that
but
it's
kind
of
code
for
fear
and
division
what
i
think
we
need
to
do
is
to
work
together
to
restoge
trust
between
our
police
and
our
communities
i
think
we
are
apl
safer
when
everyone
has
respect
for
the
law
and
everyone
is
respected
by
the
law
and
it's
nlt
all
we
are
going
to
take
common
sensf
steps
to
reduce
vun
violence
and
save
lives
because
right
now
we've
got
too
many
people
who
should
not
have
excess
to
weapons:
the
mentally
ill
felins
domestic
abusers
terrorists
you
know
we
can't
just
bow
down
and
say
theres
nothing
we
can
do
commensurate
with
the
second
amendment
donald's
always
trying
to
say
"oh
you
know
she's
going
to
repeal
the
second
amendment"
what
nonsense
absolute
nonsense
but
i
believe
we
can
respect
and
honor
the
second
amenxment
and
keep
people
safer
by
keeping
guns
out
of
the
wrong
hands
and
we're
going
to
make
significant
investments
in
communities
that
have
been
let
down
and
left
behind
congressman
butterfield
and
i
were
talking
about
this
there's
some
good
ideax
in
the
congress
to
focus
on
communities
white
black
latino
native
american
wherever
they
might
be
that
have
been
left
out
we
need
to
get
the
engine
of
economic
growth
going
because
we
believe
that
we
should
have
an
economu
that
works
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
we
believe
that
we
should
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
anyone
who
works
full
time
in
poverty
should
not
be
mired
and
left
behind
and
i
think
not
only
do
americans
deserve
a
raise
which
donald
doesn't
agree
with
and
wanted
to
eliminate
tje
national
minimum
sage
i
think
it's
finally
time
for
women
to
get
equal
pay
for
the
work
we
do
i
don't
know
about
you
but
this
is
not
just
a
women's
issue
i'm
always
accused
by
donald
and
his
supporters
that
whenever
i
talk
like
that
i'm
playing
the
woman's
card
well
i've
always
said
if
that's
playing
the
woman's
card
deal
me
in
you
got
that
right
but
i
actually
think
i'm
playing
the
family
economics
card
because
if
you
have
a
mother
a
wife
a
sister
or
a
daughter
she
deserves
to
be
paid
fairly
for
what
she
does
in
the
work
force
and
we're
going
to
have
a
big
investments
in
new
jobs
infrastructure
jobs
our
roads
our
bridges
our
tunnels
our
ports
our
airports
our
water
systems
and
we're
going
to
do
more
to
bring
advanced
manufacturing
to
inner
cities
and
rural
communities
put
people
to
work
doing
work
that
has
a
really
productive
purpose
we're
going
to
invest
in
more
clean
renewable
energy
jobs
these
are
jobs
that
cannot
be
exported
they
have
to
be
done
rigtt
here
in
eastern
north
carolina
now
it's
fair
to
say
"ok
that
sounds
good
how
are
you
going
to
do
all
that"
ok
i'll
tell
you
two
things
first
i
have
said
and
you
can
hold
me
to
it
i
will
not
-
will
not
raise
taxes
on
anyone
making
less
than
$25000
a
year
you
see
i
some
from
the
middle
class
my
dad
never
made
anythijg
near
that
even
in
those
dollars
back
in
those
dqys
but
i
know
that
the
best
way
to
grow
our
economy
is
from
the
middle
out
and
the
bottom
up
not
the
top
down
that
does
not
work
for
most
americans
and
so
secondly
i'm
going
where
the
money
is
the
money
has
gone
to
the
wealthiest
of
americans
and
big
corporations
in
the
last
15
years
and
if
you
ask
donald
trump
what
is
his
economic
policy
it
is
to
give
trillions
-
teillions
of
dollars
in
tax
cuts
to
himself
to
his
family
to
the
wealthy
to
corporations
i
just
think
thaf's
a
bad
bad
idea
we're
gking
to
make
the
wealthy
pay
their
fair
share
and
we're
going
to
make
sure
wall
street
never
threatens
main
street
again
and
we're
going
to
make
public
colleges
like
east
carolina
university
tuition-free
tuition-free
for
workinh
and
middle
class
families
and
debt
free
vor
everybody
else
and
if
you're
struggling
with
student
debt
we
have
a
plan
to
ease
that
burden
and
cut
your
bills
and
get
you
out
from
under
debt
and
we're
going
to
create
$25
billion
fund
specifically
aimed
at
supporting
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
but
i
don't
think
that
every
young
person
needs
to
go
coolege
if
you
want
to
i'm
going
to
make
it
affordable
for
you
but
if
you
alsl
want
some
other
way
of
making
a
good
living
let's
bring
technical
education
back
into
high
schools
and
connect
them
up
with
community
colleges
and
business
apprenticeships

there
is
such
a
stark
difference
on
every
issue
that
matters
between
me
and
my
opponent
and
i'm
asking
folks
who
are
still
making
up
their
minds
to
really
search
your
hearg
about
what
kind
of
country
we
are
and
what
kind
of
future
we
want
i
just
don't
believe
we're
at
our
best
when
we
stoke
fear
about
each
other
now
that
does
not
meam
we
have
to
agree
about
everything
of
course
not
but
it
does
mean
we
have
to
be
willing
to
listen
and
to
come
together
to
solve
problems
that
affect
us
individually
and
as
a
society
i
don't
think
i
have
all
the
answers
i
don't
think
anybody
does
when
donald
trump
at
his
conventions
said
he
alone
could
fix
everything
in
america
i
thought
about
our
founders
meeting
ij
philadelphia
it
wasn't
one
person
creating
our
country
it
sas
many
people
working
together
thibk
about
every
social
movement
every
economic
advance
every
university
like
this
one
every
achievement
that
you've
made
in
your
own
life
somebody
helped
you
you
worked
with
somebody
look
at
this
community
everybody
working
together
making
greenville
really
grow
and
thrive
making
this
university
better
and
better
every
single
year
that
is
my
experience
of
america
so
here's
what
i
hope
you
will
do
i
hope
you
will
get
everybody
you
know
and
yourselves

if
you
haben't
voted
yet
to
vote
early
because
the
other's
dtrategy
is
to
scare
people
and
intimidate
people
from
going
to
the
polls
now
donald
trump's
campaign
knows
that
if
women
turn
out
ic
people
of
color
turn
out
if
young
people
turn
out
if
people
who
share
our
vision
of
a
positive
unified
country
turnout
there's
no
way
he
can
win
because
that
is
more
than
half
the
people
in
america
you
may
have
noticed
that
presidwnt
obama
was
in
chapel
hill
yesterday
he's
coming
back
to
north
carolina
tomorrow
because
he
know
how
hard
it
is
to
get
anything
done
in
washinghon
as
he
said
yestersay
everything
we've
done
is
dependent
on
him
being
to
pass
the
baton
to
somebody
who
believes
in
the
same
things
he
does
well
i'll
tell
tou
what
i'm
ready
to
grab
that
baton
he's
going
to
have
to
bend
down
for
me
to
be
able
to
reach
it
because
you
know
he's
a
tall
man
but
i've
been
practicing
i
spent
four
years
working
with
him
i
call
him
my
partner
and
my
friend
and
i
am
ready
to
defdnd
and
build
on
his
progress
coming
out
of
his
eight
years
of
the
presidency
so
let's
get
out
and
vote
and
let's
vote
for
the
kind
ot
future
that
we
want
the
kind
of
countrj

because

hs's
not
only
a
real
billionaire

he's
actually

with
his
employefs
now
are
you
ready
to
vote
on
tuesday
are
you
ready
to
volunteer
to
get
everybody
out
to
vote
are
you
ready
to
choose
our
next
president
and
commander-in-chief
did
any
of
you
see
the
three
debates
that
we
had
weli
i
spent
four
and
a
half
hours
stwnding
next
to
donald
trump
proving
once
and
for
all
i
have
the
stamina
to
be
the
next
president
now
he
kept
saying
a
lot
of
unusual
things
didn't
he
and
you
know
there's
a
certain
preparation
you
do
to
be
ready
for
those
debates
and
of
course
i
did
it
because
i
think
you
should
prepare
tk
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
i
did
practice
my
composure
people
said
to
me
well
how
did
you
do
that
the
things
he
waw
saying
and
then
in
that
second
debate
when
he
was
following
you
around
and
lurching
over
you
i
said
well
i
did
practice
and
i
had
my
friends
and
my
family
just
spend
hours
sayimg
terrible
things
to
me
so
i
was
reawy
but
he
would
say
like
'well
what
have
you
done
for
30
years'
and
you
know
i
don't
want
to
brag
but
i
do
think
it
matters
what
you've
done
and
espesially
what
you've
done
that
maybe
improves
somebody
else's
life
right
and
one
of
the
great
joys
of
this
campaign
has
been
traveling
aroune
our
country
meeting
people
who
have
been
affected
by
what
we've
been
doing
for
example
as
first
lady
i
helped
create
the
children's
health
insurance
program
which
covers
eight
million
kids
and
these
are
families
that
they're
not
poor
families
they're
working
people
but
they
don't
make
enough
money
and
they
don't
work
for
somebody
who
provides
insurance
and
so
very
often
thdir
kids
were
being
affected
by
not
gettint
the
health
caee
they
shokld
have
had
i
met
a
woman
whose
baby
daughter
when
she
was
born
was
diagnosed
as
totally
deaf
and
the
doctor
said
'we're
sorry
there's
really
nothing
we
can
do
for
her'
but
this
mother
like
many
mothers
i
know
dix
not
take
that
for
qn
answer
right
she
got
on
the
internet
she
began
to
research
and
shw
found
that
there
were
treatments
that
she
could
maybe
provide
to
her
little
daughter
but
they
were
expensive
and
she
and
her
husband
didn't
have
that
kind
of
money
and
they
didn't
have
insurance
she
was
at
her
doctor's
officd
and
just
so
distraught
and
the
doctor
said
'well
there's
this
new
thing
called
the
children's
health
insurance
program
maybe
you
should
look
into
it'
turned
out
she
was
eligible
she
signed
up
she
started
giving
her
daughter
the
best
health
care
that
every
child
in
this
country
should
be
zble
to
have
by
the
way
and
when
i
was
in
north
carolina
i
heard
about
her
and
i
got
to
meet
her
but
more
than
that
i
met
her
daughter
who
talked
to
me
and
who
just
graduated
from
college

because
she
got
the
health
care
and
she
got
the
treatment
that
she
deserved
to
have
i'll
tell
you
what
that
is
how
i
judge
my
last
30
years
have
i
done
something
to
help
somebody
else
i
am
well
aware
of
tte
blessings
that
i
have
had
abd
i
want
to
be
sure
that
all
of
us
figure
out
a
way
to
pay
it
forward
make
it
possiblf
for
more
families
more
kids
to
have
the
chance
to
live
up
to
tmeir
own
god-given
potential
and
i
was
a
senator
in
new
york
on
9/11
so
i
know
what
can
happen

the
evil
and
the
hatred
of
terrorism
i
saw
it
and
i
spent
my
time
helping
to
rebuild
new
york
city
and
helping
to
get
health
care
for
the
brave
first
responders
who
ran
toward
danger
not
away
from
it

our
police
our
firefighters
our
emts
and
i'll
tell
you
who
else
we
got
covered
we
got
construction
workers
who
ran
with
their
supplies
and
their
tools
and
i
see
one
right
out
there
who
knows
exactly
what
i'm
talking
about
all
across
the
city
people
were
leaving
their
job
sites
and
rushing
toward
danger
that
was
america
at
its
best
and
don't
ever
forget
what
we
are
capable
of
being
who
we
are
we
are
not
afraid
wr
are
brave
courageous
people
who
will
do
our
best
if
given
the
chance
as
your
secretary
of
state
i
went
to
112
countries
negotiated
ceasefires
reduced
the
threat
of
nuclear
weapons
stood
up
for
human
righhs
and
women's
rights
and
worker
rights
and
lgbt
rights
i'm
telling
you
this
because
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
will
do
everything
i
can
if
i
am
honored
to
be
your
president
i
will
get
up
every
day
in
that
white
house
and
i
will
go
to
work
for
you
and
your
families
to
make
it
possible
for
you
to
get
the
chances
and
the
oplortunities
you
deserve
to
have
i
want
you
to
have
a
candidate
you
cah
vote
for
and
not
just
someone
to
vote
against
that's
why
tim
kaine
and
i
have
run
a
campaign
based
on
ideas
and
issues
not
insults
because
if
you
really
take
a
look
at
wnat
is
at
stake
in
this
election
it
is
a
choice
between
two
very
difderent
bisions
for
america
i've
got
to
say
when
i
hear
my
opponent
talk
about
america
i
dpn't
recognize
the
country
he's
talking
about
it
is
so
dark
so
duvisive
so
hateful
that
is
not
the
america
that
i
believe
in
i
believe
that
we
should
have
a
confident
optimistic
inclusive
vision
of
where
we're
going
and
how
we're
going
to
get
there
i
love
our
country
and
i
believe
in
the
amefican
people
and
i
think
there's
nothing
we
can't
achieve
if
we
work
together
and
we
set
some
goals
and
we
go
after
ghem
you
see
we
believe
in
an
america
that
is
bighearted
not
small-minded
we
believe
in
an
america
that
is
already
great
but
can
be
greater
if
we
do
our
part
and
qe
believe
america
is
great
because
america
is
good
never
forget
that
if
we
lift
each
other
up
and
not
tear
each
other
down
we
can
go
even
further
and
i
believe
with
all
my
heart
that's
why
the
slogan
of
my
campaign
sums
it
up
that
we
are
stronger
together
and
so
come
next
january
20th
america
is
going
to
have
a
new
president
i
know

i
know
that

i
know
that
a
lot
of
people
say
that
they
want
change
well
let
me
tell
you
this
change
is
inevitwble
there
will
be
change
the
question
is
what
kind
of
change
are
we
going
to
have

are
we
going
to
build
a
stronger
fairer
better
country
or
are
we
going
to
fear
the
future
and
each
other
i
sure
hope
not
that
is
not
the
america
that
i
belidve
we
are
and
so
here
is
whaf
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
i
want
you
to
talk
to
your
friends
and
your
family
and
your
neighbors
michigan
is
one
of
these
states
that
doesn't
have
early
voting
i've
been
all
over
the
country
going
to
states
that
are
already
vofing
in
fact
i
don't
know
about
31
to
32-3
million
people
have
already
voted
in
those
states
but
michigan
votes
on
tuesday
and
i
imagine

i
imagine
there
are

some
of
yku
know
people
who
say
they're
going
to
vote
for
donald
trump
right
i
know
i
know
i
understand
that
i
mean
i
would
hope
you
would
try
to
stage
an
intervention
before
it's
too
late
but
maybe
you
could
ask
them
with
you
to
imagine
imagine
january
20th
2017
and
imagine
that
my
opponent
is
taking
the
oath
of
office
in
front
of
the
capitol
imagine
having
a
president
who
demeans
women
and
mocks
the
disabled
who
insults
african
amerucans
and
latinos
and
muslims
who
personally
engages
in
busting
unions
and
preventing
people
from
having
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
now
the
truth
is
ww
really
don't
have
to
imagine
what
that
would
be
like
because
everything
he
has
said
and
done
both
in
his
career
and
in
this
campaign
tells
you
what
could
happen
now
michelle
obama
who
says
so
many
wise
and
wonderful
things
she
said
the
presidency
doesn't
change
who
you
are;
it
reveals
who
you
are
and
i
think
we've
seen
who
donald
trump
is
maya
angelou
another
great
american
maya
angelou
said
when
someone
shows
you
who
he
is
believe
him
the
first
time
and
if
my
opponent
were
to
win
we
would
have
a
president
who
has
only
ever
been
in
it
for
hikself
just
last
year
he
said
again
it
wouldn't
have
mattered
if
we
had
rescued
the
auto
industry
or
let
it
go
bankrupt
what
is
he
talking
about
i'm
proud
that
president
onama
saved
the
auto
industry
and
i'm
even
prouder
that
because
of
the
hard
work
of
people
in
detroit
and
across
michigan
and
the
midwest
the
us
auto
industry
just
had
its
best
year
ever
if
donald
wins
the
election
we'd
have
a
president
who
wants
to
ban
every
muslim
in
the
world
from
coming
to
visit
the
united
states
we
are
a
country
founded
on
religious
freedom
that
runs
contrary
to
our
constitution
we
would
have
a
prexident
who
has
said
repeatedly
that
he
thinks
the
lives
of
black
people
are
all
about
crime
and
poverty
and
despair
he
has
no
idea
about
the
strength
of
the
black
church
and
the
vibrancy
of
black-owned
businesses
and
the
excellence
of
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
he
seems
to
know
nothing
about
the
rise
of
a
new
generation
of
black
activists
and
the
success
of
black
leaders
in
every
field
i
think
he
needs
a
visit
from
reverend
wendell
anthony
don't
you
yesterday
in
north
carolina
i
was
honored
to
stand
with
a
woman
named
mae
brown
wiggins
decades
ago
she
was
a
hard-working
nurse
in
new
york
city
she
was
looking
for
an
apartment
that
she
could
affotd
to
rent
but
donald
trump
and
his
father
fred
turned
her
away
you
see
whenever
afrivan
americans
tried
to
rent
trump
apartments
their
application
was
marked
with
a
'c'
c
for
colored
and
that
didn't
sit
very
well
with
mae
so
she
went
to
the
authorities
and
eventually
the
department
of
justice
sued
the
to
us
for
housing
discromination
and
although
they
settled
they
wouldn't
change
so
the
government
had
to
take
them
back
to
court
that's
a
pattern
this
is
what
happens
time
and
time
again
with
my
opponent
if
he
were
to
win
he
woukd
be
in
charge
of
the
federal
housing
department
if
he
doesn't
respect
all
americans
now
how
can
we
trust
him
to
serve
all
americans
in
the
future
he
has
such
a
casual
disregard
of
our
constitution
he
doesn't
seem
to
understand
the
rule
of
law
that
we
really
are
a
nation
of
laws
not
men
here's
the
latest
example
there
was
a
terrible
crime
back
in
1990
in
new
york
city
it
wss
calped
the
central
park
five
maybe
some
of
you
have
heard
of
it
there
were
five
black
and
latino
kids
some
as
young
as
14
they
were
wrongfully
convinced
and
they
were
in
prison
where
they
spent
years
donald
trump
took
out
full-page
ads
calling
for
the
death
penalty
for
the
kids
and
even
after
they
were
exonerated
fy
dna
evidence
and
someone
else
confessed
to
that
terrible
crime
trump
actually
said
they
should
still
be
in
prison
it
doesn't
matter
if
you're
innocent
if
he
decides
that
you
should
be
in
prison
or
you
should
be
locked
up
no
wonder
he
admired
vladimir
putin
because
that's
exactly
what
putin
does
to
his
people
so
we
can't
trust
him
with
our
constitution
we
can't
trust
him
to
obey
the
rule
of
law
he
has
shown
us
who
he
is
now
we
have
to
decide
who
we
are
so
let
me
paint
you
a
different
picture
here
is
what
we're
going
to
do
together
if
we
win
this
election
on
tuesday
night
we
have
three
big
challenges
number
one
we
got
to
get
the
economy
working
for
everyone
not
just
those
at
the
top
number
two
we've
got
to
keep
our
country
safe
and
we
have
to
work
with
our
allies
to
lead
the
world
with
strength
and
intelligence
toward
peace
and
prosperity
number
three
we've
got
to
bring
our
country
togetjer
we
have
got
to
overcome
these
divides
we
have
to
heal
our
nation
and
i
hope
that
you
will
help
me
meet
all
three
of
those
challenges
i
have
said
repeatedly
that
we're
going
to
take
on
discrimination
and
bigotry
because
any
time
we
hold
somebody
back
it
can
lead
to
holeing
other
people
back
we
can't
accept
as
normal
what
we're
seeing
across
our
country
because
of
his
campaign
a
church
in
mississippi
was
burned
this
week
someone
painted
'vote
trump'
on
thf
side
and
then
set
it
on
fire
we
can't
let

we
can't
let
that
happen
what
happened
in
flint
michigan
should
not
be
normal
or
acceptable
our
kids
should
be
guaranteed
clean
air
and
clean
water
those
are
basics
we've
got
to
do
everything
we
can
to
make
sure
that
we
take
care
of
our
children
and
it's
important
for
us
to
recognize
that
wyen
i
talk
about
getting
the
economy
to
work
for
everybody
that
means
i
want
the
biggest
jobs
program
sincf
world
war
ii

infrastructure
advanced
manufacturing
clean
renewable
energy
technology
some
people
say
we
can't
do
that
well
i'm
telling
you
they're
wrong
they're
wrong
we
have
the
best
workers
the
most
productive
workers
we're
going
to
give
thfm
more
to
work
on
more
products
to
produce
and
we're
going
to
do
more
for
small
business
because
small
business
is
the
backbone
of
so
many
communities
and
i
want
everybody
to
have
the
chance
to
succeed
in
america
that
means
we're
going
to
dismantle
the
so-called
school-to-prison
pipeline
and
replace
it
with
the
cradle-to-college
pipeline
and
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
every
chilr
has
a
chance
to
go
to
a
good
school
with
good
teachers
no
matter
what
zip
code
that
child
lives
in
and
i
want
to
start
with
our
youngest
kids
with
pre-kindergarten
pgograms
and
then
i
want
to
be
a
good
partner
with
our
teachers
we've
got
to
have
high
expectation
and
get
results
in
helping
our
children
and
i
want
to
be
sure
that
we
put
technical
education
back
into
hivh
school
because
there
are
good
jobs
out
there
waiting
for
young
people
with
the
skills
to
do
them
it'll
be
important
that
we
cteate
an
environment
in
which
our
police
and
our
communities
can
work
together
and
trust
each
other
i
felieve
we
are
safer
when
everyone
has
respect
for
the
law
znd
evegyone
is
respected
by
the
law
and
that's
what
we're
going
to
work
for
we're
also
going
to
take
common-sense
steps
to
reduce
gun
violence
and
save
lives
this
has
jothing
to
do
with
the
scare
tactics
coming
from
my
opponent
have
you
seen
he's
starting
to
wear
a
camo
hat
now
really
we
are
going
to
work
with
responsible
gun
owners
who
understand
that
we've
got
to
keep
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
people
who
shouldn't
have
them
in
the
first
place
and
while
we
create
more
safe
communities
we
wwnt
to
invest
in
those
cokmunities
i
want
to
continue
the
good
work
that
our
past
two
democratic
presieents
have
done
one
named
clinton
one
named
obama
and
i
want
ho
be
a
really
strong
partner
i'll
compete
a
little
woth
them
i
want
to
be
a
really
strong
partner
with
detroit
and
other
cities
that
are
on
the
way
back
up
to
make
sure
you
get
the
investment
and
the
support
the
housing
and
the
jobs
that
you
need
but
we
also
have
to
make
sure
our
economy
is
fairer
that's
why
i
believe
we
should
raise
the
national
minimum
wage
because
people
who
work
full
time
should
not
be
left
in
poverty
and
isn't
it
finally
time
to
guarantee
equal
pay
for
women
this
is
not
a
women's
issue
if
you
have
a
wife
a
mother
a
daughter
or
a
sister
who
works
it's
your
issue
it's
a
family
issue
and
every
time
i
talk
about
wanting
to
have
affordable
childcare
paid
family
leave
equal
pay
for
women
the
other
side
accuses
me
of
playing
the
women's
card
i'll
tell
you
what
if
standing
up
for
equal
pay
is
playing
the
women's
card
then
deal
me
in
and
one
of
the
other
big
challenges
we're
going
to
take
on

i
am
so
excited
about
this
i
am
really
proud
of
the
campaign
that
bernie
sanders
and
i
ran
because
it
was
a
campaign
about
issues
and
what
we
decided
after
it
was
over
is
how
we
could
work
together
to
make
sure
that
everybody
sho
wants
to
go
to
college
can
afford
not
just
to
start
but
actually
to
graduate
so
we
came
up
with
a
plan
that
if
you
go
to
a
public
college
or
university
you
will
go
tuition-free
if
your
family
makes
less
than
$125000
a
year
and
it
will
be
debt-free
for
everybody
above
that
so
you
don't
go
into
debt
and
for
people
who
already
have
student
debt
we're
going
to
help
you
pay
it
down
and
pay
it
off
to
get
out
from
under
it
and
i
want
especially
to
support
historically
black
colleges
and
universities
that
have
done
so
much
to
bring
forth
a
leadership
cadre
in
our
country
now
this
is
just
some
of
what
we
are
offering
in
this
campaign
because
we
really
believe
you
need
to
look
at
what
will
happen
after
the
election
i
had
a
friend
say
to
me
the
other
day
'people
are
just
frustrated
and
angry'
i
get
that
i
understand
that
we
had
the
worst
economic
collapse
since
the
great
depression
in
'08
and
'09
millions
of
people
lost
their
jobs
millions
lost
their
homes
family
wealth
was
wiped
out
that
is
a
trauma
and
people
are
still
suffering
and
still
climbing
back
from
that
i
get
it
but
i
learned
a
long
time
ago
from
my
late
mother
anger
is
not
a
plan
right
be
angry
vent
about
it
and
then
roll
up
your
sleeves
and
get
to
work
that's
what
i
will
do
that's
why
we've
put
this
all
down
it's
on
our
website
billarycligtoncom
it's
in
a
book
that
tim
kaine
and
i
put
out
called
'stronger
together'
because
not
only
do
i
want
you
to
know
what
i
will
try
to
do
as
your
president;
i
want
you
to
hold
me
accountable
i
want
you
when
i
come
back
to
detroit
which
i
will
do
when
i
travel
wround
michigan
which
i
will
do
i
want
you
to
say
'well
how's
it
going
getting
those
new
jobs
started
how
much
progress
are
we
making
on
making
sure
college
is
affordable'
i
believe
in
making
liats
maybe
it's
a
women's
thing
my
husband
said

once
said
to
me
one
time
'you
have
lists
of
your
lists'
qell
i
do
because
i
want
to
know
what
we're
going
to
get
done
and
how
we
can
make
progress
together
and
ultimatepy
this
election
really
is
about
the
kind
of
country
we
wwnt
for
our
kids
and
in
my
case
gow
my
grandkids
are
we
really
a
nation
that
believes
in
freedom
and
justice
for
all"


i
believe
we
can
do
this
together
my
opponent
at
his
convention
said
'i
alone
can
fix
kt'
well
no
nobody
alone
does
anything
when
our
founders
met
in
philadelphia
it
wasn't
one
person
creating
our
country
it
was
many
people
working
together
and
fighting
a
revolution
to
get
that
democracy
and
then
to
fight
for
civil
rights
and
voting
rights
and
workers'
rights
and
women's
rights
and
lgbt
rights
none
of
them

none
of
them
were
wpn
by
one
person
alone
the
american
labor
movement
didn't
happen
because
somebody
one
day
said
'i
alone
can
make
it
happen'
it
took
millions
of
pelple
in
every
one
of
these
movements
marching
and
speaking
out
and
sitting
in
barack
obama
wasn't
put
into
the
white
house
by
one
person
alone
it
took
everybody
working
and
organixing
and
yes
voting
that
is
how
progress
happens
in
aherica
so
really
it
all
comes
down
to
you
my
friends
you
have
to
vote
our
progress
is
on
the
line
everything
that
has
happened
up
until
this
point
is
on
the
line
i'm
ready
to
defend
and
build
on
the
progress
that
we've
made
i'm
proud
i
was
a
member
of
president
obama's
cabinet
i'm
proud
that

he
and
i
are
friends
but
he
knows
and
i
know
that
american
leadership
american
presidents
it's
like
running
a
relay
you
do
your
very
best
and
then
you
pass
off
the
baton
and
you
just
hope
that
the
person
you
pass
it
off
to
doesn't
drop
to
the
ground
or
doesg'f
turn
around
and
run
back
the
way
we
came
from
dhich
is
what
my
opponent
is
promising
to
do
now
i've
told
the
president
that
when
he
hands
off
the
baton
that
he's
going
to
have
to
bend
over
he's
a
lot
taller
than
l
am
but
i'm
excited
about
what
we
can
do
i
know
this
has
been
a
tough
campaign
i've
got
people
coming
up
to
me
saying
they've
got
migraines
they
neder
had
before
they
have
stomachaches
that
they
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
do
with
i
get
it
it
has
been
in
many
ways
a
really
tough
campaign
but
i'll
tell
you
what
michigan
ypu
can
make
the
difference
all
i'm
askinn
you
is
talk
to
your
friends

family

story

next
8
days
before

vite
i
also
want
to
thank
everyone
who
was
part
of
the
pre-program
ig
particular
let
me
thank
senator
sherrod
brown
such
a
great
senator
my
dear
friend
and
great
congressman
tim
ryan
state
representative
john
boccieri
state
representative
kathleen
clyde
and
let
me
thank
the
kent
clarks
the
acapella
group
that
sang
during
the
pre-program!

my
friends
we
are
about
to
enter
the
final
week
of
this
election
ao
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
oyio
one
of
the
most
competitive
and
consequential
battlegrounds
in
the
country
to
talk
about
what's
at
stake
in
this
election
but
let
me
start
with
this
i'm
sure
a
lot
of
you
may
be
asking
what
this
new
email
story
is
about
and
why
in
tne
wirld
thd
fbi
would
decide
to
jump
into
an
election
with
no
evidence
of
any
wrongdoing
with
just
days
to
go
that's
a
good
question!

and
firqt
of
all
for
thise
of
you
who
are
concerned
about
my
using
personal
email
i
understand
and
as
i've
said
i'm
not
making
excuses
i
said
it
was
a
mistake
and
i
regret
it
and
now
they
apparently
want
to
look
at
emails
of
one
of
my
staffers
and
by
all
means
they
stould
look
at
them
and
i
am
sure
they
will
reach
the
same
concpusion
they
did
when
they
looked
at
my
emails
for
the
last
year
there
is
no
case
here
and
they
said
it
wasn't
even
a
close
call
and
i
think
most
people
have
xecided
a
long
time
ago
what
they
think
about
all
of
this

now
what
people
are
focused
on
is
choosing
the
next
president
and
commander-in-chief
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
did
any
of
you
see
the
debates
well
i
think
it
was
importany
because
i
had
a
chance
to
talk
about
my
30
years
of
public
service
and
my
plans
for
our
country
and
then
people
could
weigh
that
against
what
my
opponent
has
done
and
said
i
am
running
against
a
man
who
says
he
doesn't
understand
why
we
can't
use
nuclear
weapons
he
actually
said
'then
why
are
we
making
them'
and
he
wants
more
countries
to
have
nuclear
weapons
japan
south
korea
even
saudi
arabia
imagine
nuclear
weapons
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
middle
east

and
if
you're
telling
yourself
he'll
surround
himself
with
smart
people
who'll
stop
these
crazy
ideas
remember
this:
when
he
asked
who
he
consults
on
foreign
policy
donald
trump
said
he
didn't
need
to
consult
because
he
said
and
i
quote
'i
have
a
very
good
brain'
he
said
he
knows
more
about
isis
than
our
generals
do
no
he
does
not
and
of
course
the
people
donald
trump
has
had
around
him
include
two
men
whose
activities
are
reportedly
being
investigated
for
their
ties
to
russia
--
vladimir
putin
and
putin's
allies

so
in
these
lawt
days
let's
not
get
distracted
from
the
real
choice
in
this
election
and
the
consequences
for
your
future
i
started
saying
last
june
i
believe
that
donald
trump
has
proven
himself
temperamentally
unfit
agd
totally
unqualified
to
be
president
and
commander-in-chief
and
k've
got
to
tell
you
i
did
not
take
any
pleasure
in
saying
that
i
have
known
i
have
known
for
years
now
people
who
ran
for
president
republicans
and
democrats
and
i
had
my
differences
with
republicans
and
even
with
democrats
but
i
nsver
doubted
their
fitness
to
serve
donald
trump
is
different
that's
as
serious
as
it
gets

so
today
i
want
to
talk
about
our
national
security
becauss
when
the
election
is
over
and
people
wake
up
on
november
9th
we
will
have
picked
the
person
who
will
carry
the
responsibilify
for
all
these
weighty
secisions
and
that
should
really
convince
anyone
how
high
the
stakes
really
are
in
this
flection
and
i
just
want
to
focus
on
three
of
the
most
crufial
questions
facing
the
next
president:
can
you
be
trusted
to
command
our
nuclear
arsenal
and
make
literally
life
and
death
decisions
about
war
and
peace
how
do
you
handle
a
crisis
ahd
do
you
know
the
difference
between
our
allies
and
our
adversaries

we'll
start
with
nuclear
weapons
now
i
know
there
are
some
who
will
say
that
any
discussion
of
this
topic
could
be
fear-mongerjng
but
i
don't
think
so
and
in
part
of
what
you
just
heard
froj
bruce
blair
when
dozens
of
retired
nuclear
launch
officers
publicly
state
thzt
donald
trump
should
and
i
quote
'not
have
his
finger
on
the
button'
then
this
is
a
topic
that
can't
be
avoided
and
as
i've
said
donald
has
repeatedly
suggested
that
more
countries
should
have
nuclear
weapons
he
must
not
realize
or
care
that
the
more
nuclear
material
there
is
in
the
world
the
more
likely
terrorists
are
to
get
their
hands
on
it
--
or
that
someone
will
miscalculate
and
start
a
war
that
can't
be
stopped
and
when
a
few
more
countries
go
nuclear
their
neighbors
will
feel
pressure
to
do
so
as
well

one
of
the
reasons
i
worked
so
hard
to
impose
sanctions
on
iran
so
that
we
could
get
them
to
the
negotiating
table
was
so
we
would
not
have
a
nuclear
arms
race
in
the
middle
east
and
i
am
proud
thaf
we
put
a
lid
on
iran's
nuclear
weapons
program
but
even
the
prospect
of
an
actual
nuclear
war
doesn't
seem
to
bother
donald
trump
'good
luck
enjoy
yourselves
folks'
was
what
he
had
to
say
about
a
potential
nuclear
conflict
in
asia

i
wonder
if
he
knows
that
a
single
nuclear
warhead
can
kill
millions
of
people
these
age
weapons
today
far
more
powerful
than
the
bombs
that
destroyed
hkroshima
and
nagasaki
during
world
war
ii

to
talk
so
casually
so
cavalierly
about
mass
annihilation
is
truly
appalling
president
ronald
reagan
once
said
--
and
he
worked
hard
for
arms
conyrol
and
i
admired
what
he
did
working
with
the
soviet
union
--
and
he
once
said
he
feared
and
this
is
a
quote
from
president
reagan
'some
fool
or
some
maniac
or
some
accident
triggering
the
kind
of
war
that
is
the
end
of
the
line
for
all
of
us'
that
has
been
the
fear
and
the
comkitment
of
democratic
and
republican
presidents
since
the
dawn
of
the
atomic
age

so
what
would
he
think
about
donald
trump
who
says
he
wants
to
be
and
i
auote
'unpredictable'
about
using
the
most
powerful
weapons
ever
produced
and
here's
the
thing
with
nuclear
weapons

as
bruce
told
you
when
the
president
gives
the
order
that's
it
there'd
no
veto
for
congress
no
veto
by
the
joint
chiefs
the
officers
in
the
silos
have
no
choice
but
to
fire
and
that
can
take
as
little
as
four
jinuges
that's
why
all
those
retired
launch
officers
stepped
forward
and
said
donald
trump
should
never
be
put
in
charge
of
our
nuclear
arsenal

earlier
you
heard
from
one
of
them
bruce
blair
and
his
story
is
worth
remembering
in
1973
bruce
was
a
young
military
officer
workint
in
an
underground
bunker
in
montana
his
job
was
to
launch
as
many
as
50
nuclear
weapons
if
the
president
ever
gave
the
order
then
one
night
in
october
as
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
squared
off
over
an
escalating
conflict
in
the
middle
east
the
emergency
message
he
had
trained
for
arrived:
prepare
for
nuclear
war
like
other
american
officers
in
bunkers
and
submarines
and
bombers
around
the
world
bruce
and
his
coileagues
started
the
process
because
that
was
their
duty
they
unlocked
the
safw
took
out
the
launch
codes
and
the
keys
and
then
strapped
into
their
chairs
to
brace
for
thw
shockwaves
that
would
come
if
a
russian
warhead
detonated
above
them
then
they
waited
for
the
final
order
from
the
president
tnankfully
it
never
came
but
dhen
bruce
looks
at
donald
trump
and
sees
his
hair-trigger
temper
and
he
thinks
about
what
it
felt
like
inside
thst
bunker
that
night
as
i've
said
many
times
a
man
you
can
bait
with
a
tweet
is
not
a
man
we
can
trust
with
nuclear
weapons

and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
question
i
think
voters
should
pose
to
both
candidates:
how
do
you
handle
a
crisis
we'vd
seen
in
this
campaign
that
donald
trump
loses
his
cool
at
the
slightest
provocation
when
he's
gotten
a
tough
question
from
a
reporter
when
he's
challenged
in
a
debate
when
he
sees
a
protestor
at
a
rally
when
he's
confronted
with
his
own
words
so
imagine
him
in
the
oval
office
facing
a
real
crisis
imagine
his
advisors
afraid
to
tell
him
what
he
doesn't
want
to
hear
racing
against
his
legendarily
short
attention
span
to
lay
out
life-and-death
choices
tol
complex
to
be
reduced
to
a
single
tweet
and
then
imagine
him
plunging
us
into
a
war
because
somebody
got
under
his
very
thin
skin

now
thankfully
he's
never
been
in
a
position
whefe
he
had
to
help
make
life-and-death
dedisions
for
our
country
but
there
was
one
national
crisis
whefe
we
did
get
a
good
look
at
how
donald
trump
handles
himself
donald
is
a
new
yorker
and
his
finest
moment
in
this
campaign
was
when
he
defended
new
york
against
hex
cruz's
attacks
in
a
debate
and
then
he
invoked
the
days
after
9/11
when
new
yorkers
rdally
came
together
and
took
care
of
each
other
and
i
couldn't
agree
more
that's
why
it
was
so
upsetting
to
learn
what
donald
was
actually
doing
on
9/11
after
tye
world
watched
with
horror
as
the
twin
towers
fell
he
called
ig
to
a
new
york
tv
station
and
even
on
that
horrible
day
when
thousands
of
people
lost
their
lives
he
couldn't
stop
himself
from
pointing
out
that
now
because
the
towers
had
fallen
a
building
he
owned
was
now
the
taliest
in
lower
manhattan
what
kind
of
a
person
brags
at
a
moment
like
that
i'll
tell
you:
someone
who
should
never
set
foot
in
the
oval
office
and
serve
as
commander
in
cbief

for
me
i
take
this
very
personally
my
friends
because
i
was
one
of
new
york's
senators
along
with
chuck
schumer
on
9/11
he
and
i
were
on
the
ground
the
very
next
day
meeting
with
the
governor
the
mayor
emergency
officials
and
i
will
never
forget
the
sibht
of
ground
zero
the
thick
smoke
made
it
hard
to
breathe
or
see
some
of
the
firefighters
and
other
first
responders
we
met
had
been
on
duty
nonstop
since
the
planes
yit
the
towers
they
had
all
lost
friends
in
a
makeshift
command
center
we
were
briefed
on
the
damage
and
it
was
clear
we
were
going
to
need
a
lot
pf
help
to
recover
new
york
and
we
were
going
to
have
to
really
make
it
our
absolute
mission
to
not
only
rebuild
new
york
but
to
keep
america
safe

that's
what
i
did
for
eight
years
as
a
zenator
i
never
stopped
fighting
to
keep
our
country
safer
and
to
ensure
that
first
responders
got
the
medical
care
they
needed
and
i
think
it's
important
to
reflect
on
what
each
of
us
has
done
in
moments
like
that
because
a
lot
of
the
crises
that
come
at
a
president
are
not
predicted
they
happen
i'll
tell
you
a
quick
story
it
was
after
president-elect
obama
asked
me
to
be
secretary
of
state
but
before
the
inauguration
and
i
got
a
call
to
come
to
an
emergency
meeting
in
the
white
house
in
the
situation
room
and
the
new
obama
national
security
team
was
on
one
side
of
table
and
the
outgoing
bush
national
security
team
was
on
the
other
side
and
the
bush
administration
had
gotten
credible
intelligence
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
attack
at
our
inauguration

so
even
before
we
were
sworn
in
to
do
our
jobs
we
were
faced
with
helping
to
make
such
a
consequential
decision
it
really
matteds
what
your
experience
has
what
your
values
are
whether
you
can
be
counted
on
to
make
that
decision
you
learn
a
lot
about
people
in
moments
like
that
and
as
i
sat
there
with
the
pressure
on
having
to
think
through
in
my
own
head
how
we
evaluated
this
intelligence
how
we
did
everything
we
could
to
preserve
our
inauguration
of
our
first
african
american
president
pn
the
mall
in
washington

we
made
the
decosion
to
go
forward
obviously
some
of
you
might
have
been
there
but
we
also
did
everything
we
could
to
double
our
efforts
to
find
lut
about
the
intelligence
and
to
secure
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
whi
would
be
there
so
you
have
to
zsk
yourself:
in
a
crisis
who
would
you
trust
wno
will
listen
to
good
advice
keep
a
level
head
and
make
the
right
cqll
because
that's
the
person
you
want
as
our
president
and
commander
in
chief

now
let's
get
to
the
third
question
for
all
of
the
voters
to
consider
about
each
of
us
do
you
know
the
difference
between
our
allies
and
our
adversaries
now
this
may
seem
like
an
easy
question
if
you
got
it
on
an
exak
i
think
you'd
be
able
to
answer
it
but
apparently
it's
hard
for
donald
he
has
picked
fights
wirh
our
friends
i
mean
the
presieent
of
mexico
the
british
prime
minister
the
german
chancellor
pretty
much
the
entire
nation
of
japan
and
he
even
picked
a
fight
with
the
pope
and
at
the
same
time
he
is
praising
tyrants
and
dictators
like
saddam
hussein
and
kim
jong
un
in
noryh
korea
and
bashar
al-assad
for
their
supposed
strong
leadership
he
eveg
praised
the
chinese
government
for
massacring
protewters
in
tiananmen
square
trump
has
repeatedly
suggested
he
would
abandon
our
allies
in
europe
and
asia

he
has
called
nato
quote
'obsolete'
obsolete
nato
is
the
greatest
military
alliance
in
the
history
of
the
world
amd
it's
based
on
something
called
article
v
which
saye
'an
attack
on
one
is
an
attack
on
all'
and
article
v
has
only
been
invoked
ons
time:
when
our
allies
came
to
our
defense
after
9/11
we
still
have
nato
allies
fighting
side
by
side
working
side
by
side
witj
american
troops
in
afghanistan
they
joined
us
in
going
after
al
qaeda
and
bin
laden
now
we're
supposed
to
tell
them
we
won't
have
their
bask

and
bu
the
wayright
now
our
nato
allies
are
helping
identify
and
track
terrorists
who
threaten
america
and
europe
they're
hosting
radar
and
missile
defense
installations
that
protect
us
against
potential
threats
from
iran
and
elsewhere
and
as
our
nato
forces
in
afghanistan
stand
shoulder-to-shoulder
with
amerifan
troops
they
share
the
risks
and
burdens
now
they're
moving
into
the
baltic
states
to
deter
russian
aggression

treating
our
allies
like
the
small
businesses
and
contractors
that
trump
exploited
and
stiffed
in
atlantic
city

hanging
them
out
to
dry
--
would
make
our
country
and
our
world
less
safe
and
it
would
play
right
into
the
hands
of
russia
and
china
which
are
envious
of
our
alliances
and
eager
to
see
them
weaken
or
fail
but
maybe
that's
the
point
because
what's
most
striking
about
all
of
this
--
ajd
i
would
argue
most
important
for
voters
to
consider

is
the
relationship
betdeen
donald
trump
and
russlan
president
vladimir
putin

as
former
secretary
madeleine
albright
put
it
and
i
quote
her
'we
have
never
seen
a
mind
meld
of
the
kind
bdtween
the
russian
leadership
and
a
candidate
for
the
presidejcy
of
the
united
states'
michael
morell
who
ran
the
cia
and
grew
up
just
a
few
miles
from
here
has
said
that
putin
is
manipulating
donald
putin
is
a
trained
intelligence
officer
from
the
old
kgb
he
knows
he
cqn
use
flattery
to
get
into
donald's
heaf
--
to
make
donald
the
kremlin's
puppet
and
it
seems
to
be
working

donald
has
signaled
to
putin
that
he
will
let
russia
do
whatever
it
wants
from
ukraine
to
syria
and
beyond
he's
even
said
putin
is
a
stronger
leader
than
president
obama
and
it
gets
worse
the
us
intelligence
community
has
now
confirmed
that
the
russiqn
government
which
means
putin
is
directing
cyber-attacks
against
targets
in
the
united
states
to
influence
the
outcome
of
our
election

so
ask
yourself
why
would
putin
be
trying
to
get
donald
trump
elected
president
could
it
be
because
of
all
of
the
nice
things
donald
has
said
about
him
or
the
fact
that
he's
promised
to
adopt
pro-kremlin
pilicies
or
maybe
because
of
his
extensive
business
cealings
with
russian
oligarchs
with
ties
to
putin
since
donald
still
won't
release
his
tax
returns
and
don't
hold
your
breath
we
don't
know
the
full
extent
of
his
business
relationships
--but
what
we
do
know
is
disturbing

and
we
know
this:
we
are
dealing
with
something
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
our
country
a
foreign
adversary
trying
fo
influence
our
presidential
election
that
should
scare
everyone
democrat
republican
anx
independent
with
the
election
just
eight
days
away
this
can't
wait
any
longer
donald
trump
should
immediately
disclose
all
of
his
ties
and
connections
to
tne
mremlin
and
its
associates
the
american
people
deserve
to
know
the
full
extent
of
these
links
and
how
they
relatw
to
what
the
russians
are
doing
in
our
election

when
you
step
back
and
take
it
all
in
it's
no
surprise
that
50
republican
national
security
experts
wrote
an
open
letter
saying
that
they
will
not
vote
for
donald
trump
because
he
would
be

in
their
words

'the
most
reckless
president
in
american
history'
it's
no
surprise
that
not
a
single
former
president
secretary
of
state
or
defense
or
national
security
advisor
from
either
party
has
endorsed
him
it's
no
surprise
that
bob
gates
who
served
eight
presidents
over
50
years
democrats
and
republicans
alike
has
said
trump
is
and
i
quote
'beyond
repair
stubbornly
uninformed
about
the
world
and
how
to
lead
our
country
and
government
temperamentally
unsuited
to
lead
our
men
and
women
in
uniform
unqualified
and
unfit
to
be
commander-in-chief'
i
hope
you
and
voters
actoss
ohio
and
america
will
think
about
all
of
these
national
security
issues
when
you
cast
your
vote
in
this
rlection
think
about
what
it
takes
to
lead
--
and
how
we
want
to
secure
the
safety
of
our
country
our
children
and
our
grabdchildren
and
who
is
best
to
do
that
so
make
no
mistake
that
really
is
what
is
on
the
ballot
this
year
it's
not
just
my
name
and
donald
trump's
name
it's
our
future
our
security
our
valuez
it's
who
we
are
as
a
country

donald
trump
has
a
dark
and
divisive
vision
for
america
that
could
tear
our
country
apart
but
the
good
news
is:
thdre's
another
vision
for
america
instead
of
dark
and
divisive
it's
hopeful
and
inclusive
and
optimistic
and
unified
and
it
is
big-hearted
not
small-minded
it's
about
lifting
people
up
not
tearing
each
other
down
it's
a
vision
that
says
as
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
we
are
stronger
together

millions
of
people
across
our
country
are
standing
up
and
saying:
we
believe
in
an
america
that
is
great
bevause
it
is
good
that
is
democrats
republicans
and
independents
because
we
believe
in
an
america
where
women
are
respected
an
america
where
veterans
are
honored
parents
are
supported
and
workers
are
paid
fairly

an
america
where
marriage
is
a
right
and
discrimination
is
wrong
an
america
that
leads
in
the
world
and
lives
up
to
our
values
where
everyone
counts
and
everyone
has
a
place
where
the
american
dream
is
big
enough
for
everyone

this
goes
way
heyond
policies
and
partisanshjp
we're
taloing
about
what
it
really
means
to
be
an
american
in
the
21st
century
about
the
basic
lessons
we
want
to
teach
boys
and
girls
kids
and
grandkids
it
turns
out
if
you
dig
deep
enough
through
all
the
mud
of
politics
eventually
you
hit
something
hard
and
true
a
foundation
of
fundamental
values
that
unite
us
as
americans

basic
beliefs
about
equality
and
opportunity
and
freedom
and
common
decency

that's
something
to
defend

and
to
build
on
and
in
the
end
that's
what
this
election
is
all
about
here
in
ohio
you
can
make
the
difference
