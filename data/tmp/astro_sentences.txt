How are you, Donald?,1
Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us.,1
The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together.,1
Thank you, Lester.,0
Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot.,1
First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
Our jobs are fleeing the country.,0
They're going to Mexico.,0
They're going to many other countries.,0
You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.,0
That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes.,1
They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them.,0
And we have a very good fight.,0
And we have a winning fight.,0
Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing.,0
So we're losing our good jobs, so many of them.,0
I want us to invest in you.,1
I want us to invest in your future.,1
That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business.,1
When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world.,0
They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants.,0
We also have to make the economy fairer.,1
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.,1
I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing.,1
If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.,1
With the United States, as he said, not so much.,0
So Ford is leaving.,0
And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work.,1
You see that, their small car division leaving.,0
Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio.,0
They're all leaving.,0
And we can't allow it to happen anymore.,0
As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that.,0
We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.,0
I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under.,1
But we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us.,0
We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people.,0
All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis.,0
So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days.,1
They left -- fired 1,400 people.,0
They're going to Mexico.,0
So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this.,0
We cannot let it happen.,0
Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.,0
That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan.,0
Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college.,1
How are we going to do it?,1
We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes.,1
Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you.,1
It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch.,0
We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.,1
You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better.,1
I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th.,1
Companies will come.,0
Well, I think that trade is an important issue.,1
They will build.,0
They will expand.,0
New companies will start.,0
And I look very, very much forward to doing it.,0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.,0
Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent.,1
And we need to have smart, fair trade deals.,1
Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0
Our country's in deep trouble.,0
We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions.,1
We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China.,0
They're the best, the best ever at it.,0
What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing.,0
And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.,1
So we have to do that.,0
We have to renegotiate our trade deals.,0
In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.,1
I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be.,1
That is not how we grow the economy.,1
We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes.,1
And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do.,0
Let me give you the example of Mexico.,0
They have a VAT tax.,0
I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives.,1
We're on a different system.,0
When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.,0
I understand that.,1
When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately.,0
You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit.,1
He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.,1
When they sell into us, there's no tax.,0
I don't buy that.,1
It's a defective agreement.,0
I have a different experience.,1
It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it.,0
Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK?,0
Good.,0
My father was a small-businessman.,1
I want you to be very happy.,0
He worked really hard.,1
He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going.,1
And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow.,1
That's the kind of economy I want us to see again.,1
It's very important to me.,0
But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently.,0
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0
And why hasn't she made the agreements better?,0
Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago.,1
The NAFTA agreement is defective.,0
Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact...,0
We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s.,1
Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement.,0
They should have been doing this for years.,0
What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion.,0
That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.,1
We cannot do it any longer, Lester.,0
Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.,0
The companies are leaving.,0
I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them.,0
In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.,1
He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.",1
Well, it did collapse.,1
They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever.,0
And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck.,0
We wish you a lot of luck.,0
But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong.,0
Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs.,1
Five million people lost their homes.,1
And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies.,0
So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving.,0
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,1
We have to stop them from leaving.,0
And that's a big, big factor.,0
Now, we have come back from that abyss.,1
And it has not been easy.,1
That's called business, by the way.,0
So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.,1
Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession.,1
I did not.,0
They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy.,1
I did not.,0
I do not say that.,0
Take clean energy.,1
I do not say that.,0
Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
She talks about solar panels.,0
We invested in a solar company, our country.,0
That was a disaster.,0
They lost plenty of money on that one.,0
Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1
Now, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work.,0
Our energy policies are a disaster.,0
I think it's real.,1
I think science is real.,1
Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt.,0
And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad.,1
And here's what we can do.,1
We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,1
We can have enough clean energy to power every home.,1
You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt.,0
The Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it.,0
He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact.,0
We can build a new modern electric grid.,1
So I will tell you this.,0
We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs.,0
That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.,1
And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it.,0
So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place.,1
And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone.,0
Well, actually...,1
Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.,1
And I have -- well, not quite that long.,1
I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.,1
I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again...,1
... million new jobs, a balanced budget...,1
Incomes went up for everybody.,1
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this.,0
You've been doing this for 30 years.,0
Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?,0
For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions.,0
Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts.,1
I will bring -- excuse me.,0
I will bring back jobs.,0
You can't bring back jobs.,0
Yeah, for 30 years.,0
When I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test.,1
Well, he approved NAFTA...,0
He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.,0
But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...,0
Will they create jobs in America?,1
You haven't done it.,0
You haven't done it.,0
Will they raise incomes in America?,1
And are they good for our national security?,1
Excuse me.,0
Some of them I voted for.,1
Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.,0
The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against.,1
And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals.,1
You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent.,0
NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.,0
And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
But let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy.,1
You were totally in favor of it.,0
I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do.,1
I'm going to have a special prosecutor.,1
We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.,1
Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.,0
When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.,1
But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.,0
We increased them to China 50 percent.,1
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.,0
So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.,1
You called it the gold standard.,0
Well, I've been a senator, Donald...,1
And I have been a secretary of state...,1
And I have done a lot...,1
Well, that's your opinion.,1
That is your opinion.,1
You called it the gold standard of trade deals.,0
You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.,0
And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.,0
Not.,0
Well, that is just not accurate.,1
I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.,1
I wrote about that in...,1
No.,1
Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.,1
So is it President Obama's fault?,0
Is it President Obama's fault?,0
Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?,0
The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...,1
... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't.,1
I wrote about that in my book...,1
Because he's pushing it.,0
... before you even announced.,1
But you have no plan.,0
Secretary, you have no plan.,0
Look, there are differences...,1
That's about all you've...,0
There are...,1
There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world.,1
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.,0
You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.,0
And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again.,1
You are going to drive business out.,0
That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt.,1
But in -- oh, but I do.,1
Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.,0
In fact, I have written a book about it.,1
It's called "Stronger Together.",1
You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...,1
... or at an airport near you.,1
But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth.,1
And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.,0
We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business.,1
So we have a very robust set of plans.,1
And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession.,1
I'm very proud of it.,0
It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs.,0
But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence.,0
When I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over.,0
And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation.,0
That can't -- that can't be left to stand.,1
I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...,1
So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker.,1
You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business.,0
And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse.,0
I'm going to cut regulations.,0
I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.,0
So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look.,1
Because what I have proposed...,1
Facts.,0
And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see.,0
Well, could I just finish -- I think I...,0
... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt.,1
What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.,1
What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy.,1
And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.,1
Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.,1
I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website.,0
She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion.,0
And look at her website.,0
You know what?,0
No, we're not.,1
No, we're not.,1
It's no difference than this.,0
She's telling us how to fight ISIS.,0
Just go to her website.,0
She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.,0
That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work.,1
I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.,0
I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.,1
Why not?,1
No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.,0
Yeah, why not?,1
See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.,0
No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.,0
You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things.,1
Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs.,0
Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case...,1
They're going to expand their companies.,0
Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester.,1
We've looked at your tax proposals.,1
I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas.,1
They're going to do a tremendous job.,0
I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision.,0
And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy.,0
I happen to support that.,1
I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit.,1
It's a great thing for the middle class.,0
It's a great thing for companies to expand.,0
But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do.,1
You've proposed an approach that has a...,1
And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad.,0
So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country.,0
... $4 billion tax benefit for your family.,1
And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back.,0
Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together.,0
And when you look at what you are proposing...,1
... it is...,1
Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something.,0
... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down.,1
And here's the thing.,0
Trickle-down did not work.,1
It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009.,1
Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked.,1
Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion.,0
I happen to think it's double that.,0
And a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that.,1
It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester.,0
And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful.,0
But we have no leadership.,0
And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class.,1
And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton.,0
I don't think top-down works in America.,1
I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate.,1
Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy.,1
Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top.,1
Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here.,1
For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns.,1
You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it.,1
We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit.,1
So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?,1
And I think there may be a couple of reasons.,1
Why not?,0
First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is.,1
There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country.,0
Yes.,0
Then you didn't read it.,0
Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be.,1
Who gave it that name?,0
Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks.,1
Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.,1
So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health.,1
And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide.,1
And the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate.,1
The first I've -- who gave it that name?,0
How much?,0
How much for my family?,0
They don't give you all the details that tax returns would.,1
Lester, how much?,0
Typical politician.,0
All talk, no action.,0
Sounds good, doesn't work.,0
And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see.,1
And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding.,1
Never going to happen.,0
Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on.,0
And we'll guess.,1
Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression.,0
And believe me: We're in a bubble right now.,0
And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down.,0
We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble.,0
And we better be awfully careful.,0
We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding.,1
And we have a Fed that's doing political things.,0
But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts?,1
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.,0
The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level.,0
Who does he owe money to?,1
Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them.,1
And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job.,0
The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.,0
I do.,1
You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail.,1
TRUMP:,1
And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently.,1
I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit.,0
And it'll be released.,0
But I'm not going to make any excuses.,1
And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released.,0
But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have.,0
It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million.,0
If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised.,0
It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.,1
But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.,0
When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year.,0
And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years.,1
You know what that is?,0
That means, who's negotiating these trade deals?,0
And the other thing I think is important‰Û_,1
... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that.,1
You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys.,1
And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald.,1
I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do.,1
We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses.,1
We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.,0
It's a beautiful facility.,1
It immediately was put to use.,1
Excuse me.,0
Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit.,0
Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years.,0
And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do...,1
Well, to...,1
I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.,0
Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them?,1
I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you.,1
I said, do you get audited?,0
He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides.,1
And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times.,1
There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once.,1
I get audited almost every year.,0
And in a way, I should be complaining.,0
You call yourself the King of Debt.,1
I'm not even complaining.,0
You talk about leverage.,1
I don't mind it.,0
You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States.,1
Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government.,1
It's almost become a way of life.,0
And we need to be very clear about that.,1
Well, you're right.,1
I get audited by the IRS.,0
Race remains a significant challenge in our country.,1
Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.,1
We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.,1
But other people don't.,0
I will say this.,0
And we've got to do several things at the same time.,1
We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of.,0
I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.,0
We have to restore trust between communities and the police.,1
We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.,1
As soon as she releases them, I will release.,0
Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law.,1
I will release my tax returns.,0
Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods.,1
So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform.,1
And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, "Don't do it.",0
I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system.,1
I will tell you this.,0
But we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform.,1
So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal.,1
No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers.,0
Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete.,0
When the audit's complete, I'll do it.,0
And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.,1
The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together.,1
But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails.,0
So we have to do two things, as I said.,1
We have to restore trust.,1
It's not negotiable, no.,0
Let her release the e-mails.,0
Why did she delete 33,000...,0
We have to work with the police.,1
That makes me smart.,0
We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.,1
And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today.,1
That was more than a mistake.,0
Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country.,1
You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids.,1
There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up.,1
But we do always have to make sure we keep people safe.,1
That was done purposely.,0
OK?,0
There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective.,1
That was not a mistake.,0
Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective.,1
It did not do what it needed to do.,1
Now, I believe in community policing.,1
That was done purposely.,0
When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful.,0
And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also.,0
And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991.,1
As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns.,0
That I can tell you.,0
Property crime is down 40 percent.,1
We just don't want to see it creep back up.,1
We've had 25 years of very good cooperation.,1
You learn a lot from financial disclosure.,0
But there were some problems, some unintended consequences.,1
And you should go down and take a look at that.,0
Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses.,1
The other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged.,0
The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money.,0
It's not a lot of money relative to what I had.,0
The buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion.,0
And the $650 isn't even on that.,0
And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated.,1
So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system.,1
We cannot just say law and order.,1
But it's not $650.,0
It's much less than that.,0
We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little.,1
We need to have more second chance programs.,1
I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system.,1
You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans.,1
So there are some positive ways we can work on this.,1
And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us.,1
But I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks.,0
Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets.,1
In a lot of places, our police are outgunned.,1
We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm.,1
These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.,0
I could do that very quickly.,0
And we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country.,1
If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun.,1
I am very underleveraged.,0
So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way.,1
I have a great company.,0
I have a tremendous income.,0
Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police.,1
I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other.,1
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way.,0
It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money.,0
When we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports.,0
Our airports are like from a third world country.,0
And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way?,1
But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.,1
I've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago.,1
They admit it's an issue.,1
They've got a lot of concerns.,1
Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street.,1
They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance.,1
And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that.,1
You land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country.,0
So the worst of all things has happened.,0
Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders.,1
We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess.,0
So there is...,1
No, I'm not.,1
New York -- New York has done an excellent job.,1
And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked.,1
We haven't even started.,0
And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw.,0
And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well.,1
Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice.,0
Look, one murder is too many.,1
And it's really a shame.,0
But it is important that we learn about what has been effective.,1
And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem.,0
And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want.,1
Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe?,1
But let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods.,1
Our country has tremendous problems.,0
And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem.,1
Well, I -- I do think...,1
I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.,1
We're a debtor nation.,0
And, yes, I did.,1
We're a serious debtor nation.,0
And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals.,0
And you know what else I prepared for?,1
And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas.,0
I prepared to be president.,1
It would be squandered, too, believe me.,0
Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work...,0
Which our country should do, too.,0
Wrong.,0
Wrong.,0
And I think that's a good thing.,1
So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time.,0
Well, just listen to what you heard.,1
Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites.,0
And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed.,1
I built an unbelievable company.,0
Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places.,0
It's an unbelievable company.,0
But it can't be dismissed that easily.,1
He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.,1
There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it.,1
But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there.,0
And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.,0
Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws.,0
But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company.,0
But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy.,1
He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.,1
My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies.,0
And that's what I do.,0
But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me.,0
I'll give you an example.,0
So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.,1
And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.,1
You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity.,1
We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another.,0
But we're opening the Old Post Office.,0
Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money.,0
And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.,1
I'm a year ahead of schedule.,0
But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high.,1
And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down.,1
And that's what this country should be doing.,0
We build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost.,0
We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing.,0
Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries.,1
There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money.,1
When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy.,0
But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states.,1
The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.,1
The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule.,0
There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this.,1
I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really...,1
And we should be able to do that for our country.,0
Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order.,0
... tough, long game here.,1
And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee.,1
And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information.,1
We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity.,1
And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information.,1
And we need law and order.,0
If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.,0
And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country.,0
And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have.,1
We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare.,1
But we will defend the citizens of this country.,1
I just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in.,0
We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States.,0
We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous.,0
You walk down the street, you get shot.,0
And the Russians need to understand that.,1
I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do.,1
In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st.,0
Thousands of shootings.,0
And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.,1
And I'm saying, where is this?,0
That is just unacceptable.,1
Is this a war-torn country?,0
It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations...,1
What are we doing?,0
And we have to stop the violence.,0
... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief.,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0
It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face.,1
In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed.,0
Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing.,1
We have to bring back law and order.,0
I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS.,1
It does involve going after them online.,1
I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere.,1
But we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate.,1
Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.,0
It brought the crime rate way down.,0
We're making progress.,1
But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it.,0
We have gangs roaming the street.,0
Our military is assisting in Iraq.,1
And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria.,1
And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants.,0
And they have guns.,0
And they shoot people.,0
And we have to be very strong.,0
But we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority.,1
And I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership.,1
I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden.,1
And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles.,1
And we have to be very vigilant.,0
We have to be -- we have to know what we're doing.,0
Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online.,1
Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard.,1
Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything.,0
Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.,1
That is absolutely proved over and over again.,1
We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated.,0
He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time.,1
But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama.,1
And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that.,1
No, you're wrong.,0
But let's talk about the question you asked, Lester.,1
It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge.,0
The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States?,1
It was taken away from her.,0
That's the most important part of this.,1
And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case.,0
How do we prevent attacks?,1
They would have won an appeal.,0
If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed.,0
No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them.,0
These are felons.,0
These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk.,0
You need more police.,0
You need a better community, you know, relation.,0
How do we protect our people?,1
And I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information.,1
You don't have good community relations in Chicago.,0
I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey.,1
You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami.,1
And they brought him down.,1
And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit.,1
It's terrible.,0
I have property there.,0
It's terrible what's going on in Chicago.,0
But when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places.,0
So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.,1
You need better relationships.,0
I agree with Secretary Clinton on this.,0
That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of.,1
You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good.,0
We're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism.,1
But you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently.,0
So there's some bad things going on.,0
We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations.,1
Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.,1
They're on the front lines.,1
They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.,1
Some really bad things.,0
But we need -- Lester, we need law and order.,0
They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to.,1
Lester, we've covered...,1
And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people.,0
And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.,0
We've covered this ground.,1
Ugh.,0
I'd like to respond to that.,0
Whew, OK.,1
First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists.,0
Let's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO.,1
You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all.,1
I agree with you.,0
And you know the only time it's ever been invoked?,1
After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side.,1
When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of.,0
With respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb.,1
These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment.,0
But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists.,0
And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off.,0
But I tend to agree with that quite strongly.,0
They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration.,1
I do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth.,0
And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know.,0
I think you've apologized for it.,0
But I think it was a terrible thing to say.,0
They had built covert facilities.,1
And when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away.,0
They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away.,1
And we had sanctioned them.,1
Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them.,0
I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough.,1
And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth.,0
So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran.,1
I think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders.,0
Five hundred murders is a lot of murders.,0
And we did drive them to the negotiating table.,1
And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot.,1
It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good?,0
That's diplomacy.,1
That's coalition-building.,1
But we went from 2,200 to 500.,0
That's working with other nations.,1
And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg.,0
And it was terminated by current mayor.,0
The other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship.,1
But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City.,0
He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war.,1
Tremendous beyond belief.,0
So when you say it has no impact, it really did.,0
That's not good judgment.,1
That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted.,1
And the worst part...,1
It had a very, very big impact.,0
... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons.,1
No, you're wrong.,0
He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
You're wrong.,0
It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.,1
He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine...,1
Murders are up.,0
All right.,0
You check it.,0
... have a good time, folks.,1
I'd like to just respond, if I might.,0
And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling.,1
I'd just like to respond.,0
That is the number-one threat we face in the world.,1
I will.,0
Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians.,0
They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years.,0
And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material.,1
The African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated.,0
They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is.,0
They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years.,0
So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.,1
And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place.,0
It's a good one, though.,1
You decided to stay home, and that's OK.,0
But I will tell you, I've been all over.,0
It well describes the problem.,1
Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter.,1
Words matter when you run for president.,1
And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities.,0
And they really matter when you are president.,1
And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done.,0
I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say.,0
And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them.,1
It is essential that America's word be good.,1
And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe.,1
I've talked with a number of them.,1
Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton.,0
But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good.,1
It's also important that we look at the entire global situation.,1
There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran.,1
And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard.,0
But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that.,1
And Donald never tells you what he would do.,1
And you can go look it up, and you can check it out.,0
Would he have started a war?,1
And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened.,0
Would he have bombed Iran?,1
If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be.,1
Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it.,0
They were pressing it very hard.,0
But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS.,1
He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan.,1
She failed to get the birth certificate.,0
When I got involved, I didn't fail.,0
So we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues.,1
People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do.,1
I got him to give the birth certificate.,0
Can they rely on us?,1
So I'm satisfied with it.,0
And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it.,0
Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values?,1
That's what I intend to do.,1
I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home.,1
We cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security...,1
... to be given any opportunities at all.,1
Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.,1
Well, one thing.,1
One thing, Lester.,1
You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.,1
But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...,1
Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country.,0
.... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.,1
Yeah.,0
And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.,1
Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it.,0
I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course.,0
But nobody was caring much about it.,0
He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.,1
And he called this woman "Miss Piggy.",1
But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.,0
Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.,1
And I think I did a good job.,0
Donald, she has a name.,1
Her name is Alicia Machado.,1
Secretary Clinton also fought it.,0
I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true.,0
And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...,1
... she's going to vote this November.,1
Look, it's true.,0
Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager.,0
Well, I support our democracy.,1
And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.,1
And she was involved.,0
But I certainly will support the outcome of this election.,1
And I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you.,1
It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want.,1
So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does.,1
Well, thank you.,1
Are you a teacher?,1
But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce.,0
Well, it was very -- I say nothing.,0
Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign.,1
And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good.,1
And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up.,1
I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it.,0
He should have produced it a long time before.,0
I say nothing.,0
But let me just tell you.,0
When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community.,0
We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country.,1
I think you can see that.,0
I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.,1
And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.,0
That's why the slogan of my campaign is "Stronger Together," because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals -- and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else.,1
If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there's nothing in my opinion that America can't do.,1
And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate.,0
I would love to respond.,0
First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama.,0
So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.,1
You treated him with terrible disrespect.,0
And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.,0
Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American.,1
I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion.,1
I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. ,1
Well, like everyone else, I've spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw.,1
You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve.,1
Donald Trump is different.,1
I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing.,1
It doesn't work that way.,0
What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women.,1
You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures.,0
And he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is.,1
I don't think you can deny that.,0
But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is.,1
But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true.,0
Because we've seen this throughout the campaign.,1
So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work.,0
We have seen him insult women.,1
It really doesn't.,0
Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued.,0
We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt.,0
We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten.,1
We've seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter.,1
We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.,1
It was very easy to do.,0
I notice you bring that up a lot.,0
And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you.,0
So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is.,1
But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others.,1
Maybe I'm trying to save the money.,0
So this is who Donald Trump is.,1
But, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing?,0
And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are.,1
Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things.,0
That's why -- to go back to your question -- I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. ,1
These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love.,1
And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president. ,1
I'll go one step further.,0
In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it.,0
Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.,1
He gets to decide what he wants to talk about.,1
No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody.,0
Instead of answering people's questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that's his choice.,1
When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high.,1
And it's a tremendously successful club.,0
And I'm so glad I did it.,0
And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women.,1
And I have been given great credit for what I did.,0
But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. ,1
And I'm very, very proud of it.,0
He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq.,1
And that's the way I feel.,0
And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion.,1
That is the true way I feel.,0
He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, "Mexican.",1
I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country.,0
That just happened, and many more are coming.,0
And I'm very proud of it.,0
He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching.,1
And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America.,1
In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE.,0
He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. ,1
... because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised. ,1
In the first debateÉ,1
...,1
I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time.,1
They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration.,0
I was just endorsed by ICE.,0
I'd never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we're going to really make lives better for people.,1
So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com.,1
I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents.,0
We have literally Trump -- you can fact check him in real time.,1
So when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge.,0
Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is -- it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. ,1
OK?,0
Well, Martha, first, let me say -- and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it -- that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account.,1
Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not.,1
I'm not making any excuses.,1
Because look at the mess that we're in.,0
It was a mistake.,1
And I am very sorry about that.,1
Look at the mess that we're in.,0
As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said.,0
We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not.,0
I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.,0
She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was.,0
But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.,1
After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all -- anyone who says otherwise has no basis -- that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.,1
I take classified materials very seriously and always have.,1
I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China.,0
It could also be lots of other people.,0
It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?,0
When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material.,1
You don't know who broke in to DNC.,0
But what did we learn with DNC?,0
Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden.,1
We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz.,0
So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.,1
Look what happened to her.,0
And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands. ,1
Look, it's just not true.,1
But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of.,0
That's what we learned.,0
Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.,0
We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game.,0
And so please, go to... ,1
It was personal e-mails, not official. ,1
ISIS.,0
So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare.,0
Not -- well, we turned over 35,000, so... ,1
It is -- it is a huge problem.,0
Yes, that's true, I didn't. ,1
I have a son.,0
I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about. ,1
He's 10 years old.,0
He has computers.,0
He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable.,0
The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough.,0
And maybe it's hardly doable.,0
But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing.,0
OK, Donald.,1
I know you're into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it's exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you.,1
But that's true throughout our whole governmental society.,0
We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them.,0
But let's at least focus... ,1
Well, first I have to say one thing, very important.,0
... on some of the issues that people care about tonight.,1
Let's get to their questions.,1
If he wants to start, he can start.,1
No, go ahead, Donald. ,1
Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS.,0
"We will take out ISIS.",0
Well, I think Donald was about to say he's going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act.,1
Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.,0
And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you.,1
And ISIS was formed.,0
So she talks about taking them out.,0
She's been doing it a long time.,0
She's been trying to take them out for a long time.,0
But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that.,0
Premiums have gotten too high.,1
And then you wouldn't have had them.,0
Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income.,0
And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters.,0
Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I've laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down.,1
But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before.,1
But that in and of itself was a good thing.,1
Wrong.,0
I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families.,1
Wrong.,0
Wrong.,0
But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits.,1
Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition.,1
Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems.,1
Well, I have to respond.,0
The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.,0
You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.,0
Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act.,1
Number four, if you're under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn't happen before.,1
So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act.,1
But we've got to get costs down.,1
We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance.,1
Under your direction, to a large extent.,0
But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly.,0
They were choking on the sanctions.,0
And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.,0
But when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO?,0
And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson.,0
But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange.,1
And then we would have to start all over again.,1
Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage.,1
That's the highest we've ever been in our country. ,1
So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. ,1
No, I mean, he clarified what he meant.,1
And it's very clear.,1
I did really well.,0
Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system.,1
But we have an employer-based system.,1
But I have common sense.,0
And I said, well, I'll tell you.,0
That's where the vast majority of people get their health care.,1
And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid.,1
I haven't given lots of thought to NATO.,0
But two things.,0
Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them.,1
Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share.,0
That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.,1
And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.,1
So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies... ,1
... get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I'm sorry, you've got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma... ,1
Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract.,0
And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror.,0
... you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it.,1
And I was very strong.,0
And I said it numerous times.,0
And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.,0
So let's fix what's broken about it, but let's not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies.,1
And I think that's great.,0
That's not going to work. ,1
Well, thank you for asking your question.,1
And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims.,1
And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO.,0
It's a lot of money to protect other people.,0
And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald.,1
But I'm all for NATO.,0
I want to say just a couple of things.,1
First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington.,1
But I said they have to focus on terror, also.,0
And they're going to do that.,0
And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.,0
And we've had many successful Muslims.,1
I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton.,0
We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali. ,1
And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops.,0
Not only that, you named the day.,0
My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community.,1
That's what America is.,1
They couldn't believe it.,0
They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it.,0
That's what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren.,1
They said...,0
It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims.,1
No, wait a minute.,0
We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines.,1
I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America.,1
When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened.,0
It should have never happened.,0
I've met with a lot of them, and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see.,1
It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations.,1
Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS.,0
But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant.,0
Now it's in over 30 countries.,0
And you're going to stop them?,0
Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans?,1
And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists.,1
I don't think so.,0
We are not at war with Islam.,1
I did not support the war in Iraq.,0
And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.,1
That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.,0
Just -- would you like to hear...,0
Wait a minute.,0
I was against the war in Iraq.,0
Just so you put it out.,0
The record does not show that.,0
The record shows that I'm right.,0
So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. ,1
Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us.,1
But there are a lot of refugees, women and children -- think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces.,1
When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows?,0
Essentially.,0
I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.,0
We talked about the economy is more important.,0
There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression.,1
I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.,0
And we need to do our part.,1
We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.,1
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.,0
But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others.,1
And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war.,0
But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion.,1
How do you do that?,1
We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty.,1
And when he -- excuse me.,0
How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county?,1
And that was before the war started.,0
Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country?,1
Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him.,0
And how do we expect to be able to implement those?,1
I was against the war.,0
He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war.,0
So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous.,1
And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there.,0
But nobody called Sean Hannity.,0
And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us.,1
And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he's denied being for the war in Iraq.,1
We have it on tape.,1
The entire press corps has looked at it.,1
And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started.,0
I think in '04.,0
It's been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. ,1
But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq.,0
So, please... ,1
... go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.,1
Well, right.,1
And one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt.,0
But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started.,0
As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called "Lincoln.",1
He and I used to have arguments about the war.,0
I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing.,0
It's going to destabilize the Middle East.,0
And that's exactly what it's done.,0
It's been a disaster.,0
No, no.,0
It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment.,1
It was principled, and it was strategic.,1
You didn't hear what I said.,0
Well, I have much better judgment than she does.,0
And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it.,1
And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments.,1
That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.,1
There's no question about that.,0
I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?,0
I have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament.,0
I have a winning temperament.,0
But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election.,1
And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out.,1
We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election.,1
I know how to win.,0
She does not have a...,0
And believe me, they're not doing it to get me elected.,1
They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. ,1
Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons.,1
But we deserve answers.,1
Wait.,0
And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has... ,1
The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control.,0
I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem.,0
... with the Russians and other foreign powers.,1
That would not start a war.,0
No, they were taunting us.,0
Wrong.,0
It's lies.,0
That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.,0
I would like to...,0
It's not an accurate one at all.,0
Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true.,1
It's not an accurate one.,0
I'm sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality.,1
So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond.,0
And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do.,1
I agree with her on one thing.,0
The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks.,0
Nuclear is the single greatest threat.,0
But I'll tell you what he's going to do.,1
Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries.,0
His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two.,1
Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift.,1
And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families.,1
Now, here's what I want to do.,1
I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year -- and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know -- will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is.,1
And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code.,1
And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.,1
I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes.,1
I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars.,1
They do not pay us.,0
It's called the Buffett rule.,1
But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune.,0
Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who's gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.,1
That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything.,0
I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything.,0
I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million.,1
All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing.,0
We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you.,1
We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million...,0
Well, wait, but it's very important.,0
All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out.,0
I want to invest in hard-working families.,1
And I think it's been unfortunate, but it's happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top.,1
We're a country that owes $20 trillion.,0
And we need to reverse that.,1
People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. ,1
And we're going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country. ,1
Well, here we go again.,1
I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York.,1
But that's not the point here. ,1
They have to help us out.,0
As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree.,0
Because I was a senator with a Republican president.,1
It is the single greatest threat that this country has.,0
Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries.,0
But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do.,0
We have not been updating from the new standpoint.,0
I will be the president and we will get it done.,1
That's exactly right.,1
I looked the other night.,0
I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them.,0
You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power.,1
We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries.,0
Look, he has now said repeatedly, "30 years this and 30 years that.",1
So let me talk about my 30 years in public service.,1
I'm very glad to do so.,1
Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it.,0
But I would certainly not do first strike.,0
I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over.,0
Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system.,1
At the same time, we have to be prepared.,0
I can't take anything off the table.,0
After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it.,1
Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there.,0
Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.,1
When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.,1
China should solve that problem for us.,0
China should go into North Korea.,0
Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years.,1
I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time.,1
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea.,0
And by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal.,0
And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. ,1
I've proven that I can, and for 30 years, I've produced results for people. ,1
Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic.,1
And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left.,1
Iran is one of their biggest trading partners.,0
And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.,1
Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS.,1
They're interested in keeping Assad in power.,1
So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones.,1
Iran has power over North Korea.,0
We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them.,1
And when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea.,0
And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places.,0
And when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that?,0
Why didn't you add other things into the deal?,0
And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.,1
One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash.,0
Nobody's ever seen that before.,0
That turned out to be wrong.,0
But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.,1
It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages.,0
Russia has decided that it's all in, in Syria.,1
And they've also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it's not me.,1
It certainly looks that way.,0
I've stood up to Russia.,1
I've taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.,1
I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine.,1
So you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal?,0
This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history.,0
And I did as secretary of state.,1
The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems.,0
All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much.,0
And they're going to end up getting nuclear.,0
That's how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons.,1
I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day.,0
Believe me, he's not a happy camper.,0
Lester, one thing I'd like to say.,0
I will go very quickly.,0
But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place.,0
Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations.,0
It's how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot.,1
So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now.,1
And it's a big problem.,0
But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable. ,1
No, I wasn't.,1
I was gone.,1
I hate to interrupt you, but at some point... ,1
And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars.,0
We cannot be the policemen of the world.,0
At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here. ,1
We cannot protect countries all over the world...,0
I would not use American ground forces in Syria.,1
... where they're not paying us what we need.,0
I think that would be a very serious mistake.,1
And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability.,0
I don't think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force.,1
I don't think that is a smart strategy.,1
I do think the use of special forces, which we're using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just... ,1
We need heart.,0
We need a lot of things.,0
Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I -- if I'm fortunate... ,1
I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq.,1
But you have to have some basic ability.,0
And sadly, she doesn't have that.,0
All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power.,0
But they weren't taken care of.,0
I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul.,1
And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.,1
No, he doesn't.,1
There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this.,1
And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.,1
I would go after Baghdadi.,1
And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of.,0
I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders -- and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones -- made a difference.,1
So I think that could help.,1
I would also consider arming the Kurds.,1
She doesn't have the look.,0
The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq.,1
And I know there's a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq. ,1
She doesn't have the stamina.,0
Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that.,1
Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families.,1
You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
I said she doesn't have the stamina.,0
And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I've been in public service.,1
And I don't believe she does have the stamina.,0
I'm proud of that.,1
You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system.,1
I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about.,1
I have worked with Latinos -- one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.,1
To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.,0
You have -- wait a minute.,0
So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that an every American feels like he or she has a place in our country.,1
And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America.,1
Wait a minute, Lester.,0
They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix.,1
She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,1
You asked me a question.,0
Did you ask me a question?,0
He's 10 years old now.,1
You have to be able to negotiate our trade deals.,0
This is the only one country he's ever known.,1
And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected?,1
You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia.,0
You know, children listen to what is being said.,1
To go back to the very, very first question.,1
And there's a lot of fear -- in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect.,1
Bullying is up.,1
A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy.,1
A lot of kids are expressing their concerns.,1
So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. ,1
Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country.,1
I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia?,0
And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying?,0
If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president. ,1
I want to be the best president I can be for every American.,1
Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters.,1
All you have to do is speak to them.,0
It's with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans.,1
And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he's never apologized for.,1
Wait.,0
You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina.,0
And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said -- I'm proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.,1
The world -- let me tell you.,0
Let me tell you.,0
And he is supporting me 100 percent. ,1
Because we talked about what we wanted to do.,1
We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates... ,1
Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience.,0
We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree.,0
But it's bad, bad experience.,0
Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal.,0
No.,1
I agree.,0
She's got experience, but it's bad experience.,0
Well, it's not only my opinion.,1
It's the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress.,1
And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience.,0
But it's in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it's not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody.,1
I never said that.,0
Everybody.,1
African-American incomes went up 33 percent.,1
I didn't say that.,0
Where did you find this?,0
And it's not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you've got it, and he never wavered.,1
Where did you find this?,0
He stuck with me.,1
Where did you find this?,0
Oh, really?,0
And I have worked and I admire President Obama.,1
OK, good.,0
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,1
That was a terrible time for our country. ,1
Let me just tell you...,0
Nine million people lost their jobs.,1
You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials.,0
Some of it's said in entertainment.,0
Five million homes were lost.,1
And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out.,1
We are back on the right track.,1
He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans.,1
Thank you.,1
Well, you're right.,1
Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her.,0
But you want to know the truth?,0
I was going to say something...,0
This is one of the most important issues in this election.,1
... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it.,0
I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.,1
I just can't do it.,0
Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.,1
And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics.,1
Donald doesn't agree with that.,1
It's inappropriate.,0
I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don't always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise.,1
I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.,1
It's not nice.",0
But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue.,0
They're untrue.,0
Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider.,1
And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality.,1
I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards.,1
I want a Supreme Court that doesn't always side with corporate interests.,1
I want a Supreme Court that understands because you're wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn't mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else.,1
So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.,1
And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they've not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.,1
I think that was a dereliction of duty.,1
I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people. ,1
And they're misrepresentations.,0
Well...,1
And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice.,0
The question was about the Supreme Court.,1
And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment.,1
And I don't deserve that.,0
But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. ,1
We have to save as many lives as we possibly can.,1
But it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done.,0
And actually -- well, that was very interesting.,1
First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business.,1
That's something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don't get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.,1
It's hundreds of millions of ads.,0
And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money...,0
... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing.,0
The other day, we were deporting 800 people.,0
You know, because it sounds like you're in the business or you're aware of people in the business -- you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent.,1
We are not dependent upon the Middle East.,1
And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens.,0
But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.,1
So the price of oil has been way down.,1
Ended up becoming citizens.,0
And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?,1
And it was 800.,0
We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels.,1
And I think that's an important transition.,1
We've got to remain energy-independent.,1
And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know.,0
It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.,1
Look, here's the story.,0
I want to make America great again.,0
We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.,1
I'm going to be able to do it.,0
I don't believe Hillary will.,0
So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem.,1
And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses.,1
The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her.,0
Well, I actually agree with that.,0
I agree with everything she said.,0
I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.,0
This is a great country.,0
But I also want to be sure that we don't leave people behind.,1
That's why I'm the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out.,1
This is a great land.,0
I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I've been doing this as a politician.,0
I cannot believe I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. ,0
And my whole concept was to make America great again.,0
When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we're giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago.,0
A lot of them lost their lives.,1
When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade, where we're doing so badly.,0
Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit.,0
They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories.,1
I don't want to walk away from them.,1
In other words, trading with other countries.,0
So we've got to do something for them. ,1
We had an $800 billion deficit.,0
It's hard to believe.,0
But the price of coal is down worldwide.,1
So we have to look at this comprehensively.,1
And that's exactly what I have proposed.,1
I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.,1
Inconceivable.,0
You say who's making these deals?,0
Well, I certainly will, because I think that's a very fair and important question.,1
Look, I respect his children.,1
We're going the make great deals.,0
His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald.,1
I don't agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that.,1
And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.,1
So I believe that this election has become in part so -- so conflict-oriented, so intense because there's a lot at stake.,1
We're going to have a strong border.,0
This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election.,1
We're going to bring back law and order.,0
Just today, policemen was shot, two killed.,0
And this is happening on a weekly basis.,0
We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.,0
At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides.,0
We need justice.,0
We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake.,1
It's one of the most consequential elections that we've had.,1
And that's why I've tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president.,1
And that's why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I've spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families.,1
And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day. ,1
Thank you very much, Chris.,1
And thanks to UNLV for hosting us.,1
But I want to do things that haven't been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it.,0
You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be?,1
It's called make America great again. ,0
What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens?,1
What kind of rights will Americans have?,1
And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy.,1
For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system.,1
No, I didn't say that at all.,0
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court.,1
I don't think you understood what was -- this was locker room talk.,0
But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v. Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us.,1
That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.,1
And I look forward to having that opportunity.,1
I'm not proud of it.,0
I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them.,1
I apologize to my family.,0
I apologize to the American people.,0
Certainly I'm not proud of it.,0
But this is locker room talk.,0
That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate.,1
The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process. ,1
Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment.,1
I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years.,1
I represented upstate New York.,1
I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership.,1
It goes back to the founding of our country.,1
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.,1
Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family.,1
And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns.,1
I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole.,1
There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment.,1
You mentioned the Heller decision.,1
You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have -- and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times.,0
And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them.,1
And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others.,1
So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment. ,1
Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions.,1
We haven't seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world.,0
And they look and they see.,0
But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms.,1
That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation.,1
Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?,0
And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA.,1
The gun lobby's on his side.,1
They're running millions of dollars of ads against me.,1
And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment.,1
And they look at our country and they see what's going on.,0
But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year. ,1
Yes, I'm very embarrassed by it.,0
I hate it.,0
Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.,1
And in this case, it's not only about Roe v. Wade.,1
But it's locker room talk, and it's one of those things.,0
I will knock the hell out of ISIS.,0
It is about what's happening right now in America.,1
So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.,1
Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood.,1
We're going to defeat ISIS.,0
ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.,0
He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood.,1
And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. ,0
And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.,0
I will defend Planned Parenthood.,1
I have great respect for women.,0
I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions. ,1
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0
And we have come too far to have that turned back now.,1
I've said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said.,0
And I was embarrassed by it.,0
But I have tremendous respect for women. ,0
And women have respect for me.,0
And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions.,1
And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking. ,1
Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account.,1
And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.,1
And I will tell you: No, I have not.,0
And I will tell you that I'm going to make our country safe.,0
The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.,1
We're going to have borders in our country, which we don't have now.,0
People are pouring into our country, and they're coming in from the Middle East and other places.,0
I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy.,1
I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.,1
We're going to make America safe again.,0
So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account. ,1
Well, that is not what happens in these cases.,1
We're going to make America great again, but we're going to make America safe again.,0
And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.,1
You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life.,1
And we're going to make America wealthy again, because if you don't do that, it just -- it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. ,0
Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they're taking our wealth. ,0
And that's what I want to talk about.,0
This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make.,1
And I do not believe the government should be making it.,1
Am I allowed to respond to that?,0
You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country.,1
I assume I am.,0
I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania.,1
And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice.,1
And I will stand up for that right. ,1
Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not.,1
It's just words, folks.,0
It's just words.,0
They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life.,1
And you're right.,1
I don't want to rip families apart.,1
Those words, I've been hearing them for many years.,0
I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed.,0
I don't want to be sending parents away from children.,1
I've heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, jobwise, safety-wise, in every way possible.,0
I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country.,1
We have 11 million undocumented people.,1
They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people.,1
He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation.,1
I'm going to help the African-Americans.,0
Now, here's what that means.,1
I'm going to help the Latinos, Hispanics.,0
It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented.,1
And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country.,1
I am going to help the inner cities.,0
She's done a terrible job for the African-Americans.,0
She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later.,0
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation.,1
I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart.,1
I have been for border security for years.,1
I voted for border security in the United States Senate.,1
We saw that firsthand when she was United States senator.,0
And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security.,1
But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person.,1
She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign... ,0
Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them.,1
When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president.,1
So, she's allowed to do that, but I'm not allowed to respond? ,0
Sounds fair.,0
Didn't even raise it.,1
It was locker room talk, as I told you.,0
That was locker room talk.,0
I'm not proud of it.,0
I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country.,0
And certainly, I'm not proud of it.,0
But that was something that happened.,0
He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall.,1
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly.,1
And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship. ,1
I voted for border security, and there are... ,1
There are some limited places where that was appropriate.,1
There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that.,1
But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants.,1
If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.,0
Mine are words, and his was action.,0
His was what he's done to women.,0
Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages.,1
There's never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.,0
And Donald knows a lot about this.,1
He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.,1
So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women.,0
Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.,0
Four of them here tonight.,0
He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported.",1
I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers. ,1
We will not have open borders.,1
That is...,1
One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12.,0
That is a rank mischaracterization.,1
Her client she represented got him off, and she's seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped.,0
Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.,0
We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform.,1
So don't tell me about words.,0
I am absolutely -- I apologize for those words.,0
But it is things that people say.,0
But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law.,0
And this used to be a bipartisan issue.,1
He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women.,0
Paula Jones, who's also here tonight.,0
And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it's disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth.,0
Ronald Reagan was the last president... ,1
... to sign immigration reform, and George W. Bush supported it, as well. ,1
Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal -- he's another real winner that you have -- and he's the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that.,0
So you really owe him an apology.,0
Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy.,1
You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined.,1
And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders.,1
You're the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb.,0
That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology.,0
Number two, Michelle Obama.,0
I think that would be a great benefit to us.,1
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks.,1
And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans.,1
They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions.,1
Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet.,1
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. ,1
So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past?,1
Those are the questions we need answered.,1
I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you.,0
We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before. ,1
And I've gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I've ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary.,0
So, you talk about friend?,0
Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States. ,1
And it's pretty clear...,1
It's pretty clear you won't admit...,1
Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion.,0
And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they say about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance.,0
And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil.,0
... that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.,1
But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing.,0
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation.,1
And I'll tell you what.,0
I didn't think I'd say this, but I'm going to say it, and I hate to say it.,0
But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.,0
We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election.,1
There has never been anything like it, and we're going to have a special prosecutor.,0
When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious.,0
We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election.,1
I find that deeply disturbing. ,1
And I think it's time you take a stand...,1
I am not quoting myself.,1
In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious.,0
There has never been anything like this, where e-mails -- and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process.,0
So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we're going to look into it, because you know what?,0
People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you've done.,0
I am quoting 17...,1
... 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian...,1
... agencies.,1
Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us.,1
And it's a disgrace.,0
And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. ,0
Oh, really? ,0
Because you'd be in jail.,0
And yet she didn't know the word -- the letter C on a document.,0
Right?,0
I find that just absolutely…,1
She didn't even know what that word -- what that letter meant.,0
You know, it's amazing.,0
I'm watching Hillary go over facts.,0
And she's going after fact after fact, and she's lying again, because she said she -- you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine.,0
I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons.,1
This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons.,1
He's... ,1
You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?,0
... advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
I don't think so.,0
She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter's wedding, number one, and a yoga class.,0
He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying.,1
But here's the deal.,1
The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.,1
Well, maybe we'll give three or three or four or five or something.,0
33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she's saying there wasn't anything wrong.,0
There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.,1
And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena.,0
And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button. ,1
Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked... ,1
That wasn't before.,0
... about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks.,1
That was after.,0
That kind... ,1
... of language -- well...,1
She got it from the United States Congress.,0
The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances.,1
And I'll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen.,0
Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case.,0
But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself.,0
Donald wants to tear up our alliances.,1
I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer.,1
What you did -- and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. ,0
I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere.,1
You did that.,0
Wait a minute.,0
That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace. ,1
Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
One second.,0
If you did that in the private sector, you'd be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. ,0
And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities.,1
Oh, you didn't delete them? ,0
Oh, 33,000?,0
Yeah. ,0
I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing.,1
I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should.,1
New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses.,1
Oh, yeah.,0
What about the other 15,000? ,0
Because you have nothing to say.,0
Get off this question.,0
Let's see what happensÉ,0
I want us to do more to help small business.,1
That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from.,1
I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty.,1
I'd like to know, Anderson, why aren't you bringing up the e-mails?,0
I'd like to know.,0
Why aren't you bringing... ,0
No, it hasn't.,0
It hasn't.,0
And it hasn't been finished at all. ,0
And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do.,1
It's nice to -- one on three.,0
No, I'm a gentlemen, Hillary.,0
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college.,1
That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future.,1
Go ahead.,0
It is such a great question and it's maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense.,0
Obamacare is a disaster.,0
You know it.,0
I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted.,1
And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is.,1
Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top.,1
So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share.,1
We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country.,1
We all know it.,0
It's going up at numbers that nobody's ever seen worldwide.,0
Nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care.,0
It's only getting worse.,0
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs.,1
In '17, it implodes by itself.,0
Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money.,0
We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt.,0
By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3.5 million jobs.,1
Obamacare will never work.,0
It's very bad, very bad health insurance.,0
Why?,1
Far too expensive.,0
And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country.,0
It's going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly.,0
Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids.,1
We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored.,0
We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want -- and President Obama and whoever was working on it -- they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies.,0
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities.,1
The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession. ,1
We want competition.,0
Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because... ,1
You will have the finest health care plan there is.,0
... the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration.,1
I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less.,1
I also will not add a penny to the debt.,1
I have costed out what I'm going to do.,1
She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada.,0
He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt.,1
Well, he mentioned the debt.,1
And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow.,0
It's catastrophic in certain ways.,0
But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything.,0
Hillary Clinton has been after this for years.,0
We know how to get control of the debt.,1
When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt.,1
When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.,1
He has cut the deficit by two-thirds.,1
So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people.,1
Obamacare was the first step.,0
Obamacare is a total disaster.,0
And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody's ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you're never going to be able to use it. ,0
It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. ,0
Well, I just want -- just one thing.,0
First of all, Hillary, everything's broken about it.,0
So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead.,1
That's the kind of approach that will work. ,1
Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that.,1
Everything.,0
It has not worked the way that it has been promised. ,1
Well, it's a combination, Chris.,1
Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment.,0
This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. ,0
And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation.,1
By the way...,0
I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state.,1
We're going to be able to.,0
You're going to have plans...,0
I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy.,1
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy.,1
He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions.,1
But it was a terrible recession.,1
So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running.,1
Well, I'll tell you what it means.,0
You're going to have plans that are so good, because we're going to have so much competition in the insurance industry.,0
Once we break out -- once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come... ,0
President Obama -- Anderson, excuse me.,0
President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud.,0
So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down.,1
That is not going to work.,1
You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said -- he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie.,0
President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan.,0
The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn't work.,0
But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we'll also be able to help people that can't get -- don't have money because we are going to have people protected.,0
That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs.,1
And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way.,0
We're going to block grant into the states.,0
We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs.,1
We're going to block grant into Medicaid into the states... ,0
... so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.,0
We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do. ,1
Well, you're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame.,0
But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that -- because there is a problem.,0
I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem.,0
Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it.,1
It didn't meet my test.,1
And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on.,0
When they see hatred going on, they have to report it.,0
I've had the same test.,1
As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people.,0
Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security?,1
I'm against it now.,1
I'll be against it after the election.,1
I'll be against it when I'm president.,1
Horribly wounded.,0
They'll never be the same.,0
Muslims have to report the problems when they see them.,0
There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald.,1
And, you know, there's always a reason for everything.,0
He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico.,1
But he mentioned China.,1
And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets.,1
I have fought against that as a senator.,1
I've stood up against it as secretary of state.,1
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum.,1
In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel.,1
If they don't do that, it's a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center.,0
Go outside.,0
So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers. ,1
Look at Paris.,0
Look at that horrible -- these are radical Islamic terrorists.,0
And she won't even mention the word and nor will President Obama.,0
That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work.,1
We're going to pull the country together.,1
We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce.,1
That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history.,1
And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products. ,1
He won't use the term "radical Islamic terrorism.",0
No, I voted. ,1
Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times. ,1
But I think it's really an important issue.,1
He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that.,1
You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name.,0
She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name.,0
And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools.,1
He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings.,1
But the name is there.,0
It's radical Islamic terror.,0
In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas.,1
And before you solve it, you have to say the name. ,0
First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq.,0
He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses.,1
In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights.,1
He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine. ,1
And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice.",1
So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision. ,1
Well...,1
At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women.,1
Iraq was disaster.,0
And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them.,1
So he would have been alive today.,0
The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world.,0
Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands -- excuse me.,0
Now, what was his response?,1
Excuse me.. ,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0
Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted. ,1
You interrupt me all the time.,0
Why don't you interrupt her?,0
In fact, he went on to say... ,1
He went on to say, "Look at her.,1
I don't think so.",1
It's called extreme vetting.,0
About another woman, he said, "That wouldn't be my first choice.",1
We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama.,0
He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her "disgusting," as he has called a number of women during this campaign.,1
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger.,1
He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.,1
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama.,0
So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women.,1
People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more.,0
This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time.,0
That's who Donald is.,1
We have enough problems in this country.,0
I believe in building safe zones.,0
I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people.,0
But I don't want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them.,0
We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. ,0
I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater.,1
America is great, because America is good.,1
That's not been debunked.,0
That has not been debunked.,0
And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren. ,1
I was against -- I was against the war in Iraq.,0
Has not been debunked.,0
Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility.,1
And it's not just about women.,1
He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything.,1
And you voted for it.,0
So we know what he has said and what he's done to women.,1
But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television. ,1
And you shouldn't have.,0
Well, I just want to say... ,0
Excuse me.,0
He went after Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion.,1
She just went about 25 seconds over her time.,0
Could I just respond to this, please? ,0
Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens.,0
He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers "people who aren't captured.",1
When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don't want them.,0
He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican.,1
So it's not one thing.,1
This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies.,1
That is not who America is.,1
In some cases, they're murderers, drug lords, drug problems.,0
And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election.,1
It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have. ,1
Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values.,1
The State Department has said that.,1
I think that's been proven.,1
And they don't want them.,0
And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that's OK, we can't force it into their country.,0
Let me tell you, I'm going to force them right back into their country.,0
They're murderers and some very bad people.,0
And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you've never seen.,0
But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does.,1
You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that.,1
But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment.,1
We're also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip.,0
In partnership with the American Health Association... ,1
At a record clip.,0
And it shouldn't be allowed to happen.,0
... we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches... ,1
Well, it is an open discussion.,1
And you... ,1
Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is…,1
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work...,1
ICE just endorsed me.,0
They've never endorsed a presidential candidate.,0
... and the high rankings…,1
Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country.,1
I'm very proud of that.,1
We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations.,1
And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald.,1
The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border.,0
She doesn't.,0
She wants amnesty for everybody.,0
I mean, who does that?,1
It just was astonishing.,1
But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere.,1
Come right in.,0
Come right over.,0
It's a horrible thing she's doing.,0
She's got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States.,0
The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti.,1
Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years.,1
That I can tell you. ,0
Well, I think I should respond, because -- so ridiculous.,0
The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had.,1
We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else.,1
Look, now she's blaming -- she got caught in a total lie.,0
And we're going to keep working to help Haiti... ,1
... because it's an important part of the American experience.,1
Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things -- WikiLeaks that just came out.,0
But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns.,1
He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it.,1
And she lied.,0
Now she's blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln.,0
You can look at our tax returns.,1
That's one that I haven't... ,0
We've got them all out there.,1
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax.,1
OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied.,0
That's the good thing.,0
And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris.,1
That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.,0
That's a big, big difference.,0
You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax.,1
So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire.,1
We're talking about some difference.,0
I find that just astonishing. ,1
Well, you know... ,1
But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don't know Putin.,0
Made with Chinese steel.,1
I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example.,0
But I don't know Putin.,0
But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are -- she doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking.,0
Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying.,1
You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him.,1
Maybe there is no hacking.,0
The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails.,1
But they always blame Russia.,0
They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged.,1
And the reason they blame Russia because they think they're trying to tarnish me with Russia.,0
He lost the Iowa caucus.,1
He lost the Wisconsin primary.,1
He said the Republican primary was rigged against him.,1
Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him.,1
There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him. ,1
This is -- this is a mindset.,1
This is how Donald thinks.,1
And it's funny, but it's also really troubling. ,1
So that is not the way our democracy works.,1
I know nothing about Russia.,0
We've been around for 240 years.,1
We've had free and fair elections.,1
I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia.,0
We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them.,1
I don't deal there.,0
And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election.,1
You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished...,1
... it just shows you're not up to doing the job.,1
I have no businesses there.,0
I have no loans from Russia.,0
I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office.,0
And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means.,1
He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy.,1
One of the primary area things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet.,0
But I have no loans with Russia.,0
You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have.,0
Now, the taxes are a very simple thing.,0
As soon as I have -- first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,0
Many of her friends took bigger deductions.,0
And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position. ,1
Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground.,1
But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force.,1
I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do.,1
In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself.,1
The goal here is to take back Mosul.,1
Warren Buffett took a massive deduction.,0
Soros, who's a friend of hers, took a massive deduction.,0
Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her -- took massive deductions.,0
I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.,0
It's going to be a hard fight.,1
But -- but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I'll release my returns.,0
I'll be very proud to.,0
They're actually quite great. ,0
Well, one thing I'd do is get rid of carried interest.,0
One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code.,0
I've got no illusions about that.,1
And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters.,1
And she could have done this years ago, by the way.,0
She's a United States -- she was a United States senator.,0
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation.,1
She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code.,0
Well, why didn't she change it?,0
But we know we've got lots of work to do.,1
Why didn't you change it when you were a senator?,0
The reason you didn't is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do.,0
Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue.,1
And I do.,0
So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS.,1
You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change.,0
But you wouldn't change it, because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump.,0
But -- and I say that about a lot of things.,0
That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons.,1
You know, I've heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years.,0
If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.,1
And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track. ,1
"I wish you would have done this.",0
Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq.,1
But she's been there for 30 years she's been doing this stuff.,0
I said it was a mistake.,1
She never changed.,0
And she never will change.,0
She never will change.,0
We're getting rid of carried interest provisions.,0
I'm lowering taxes actually, because I think it's so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones, little ones can't form.,0
I've said that years ago.,1
We're getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes.,0
But we're bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
He has consistently denied what is... ,1
We're cutting taxes for the middle class.,0
... a very clear fact that...,1
And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class.,0
... before the invasion, he supported it.,1
And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it.,1
And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks.,0
You can look at me.,0
She's raising your taxes really high.,0
And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country.,0
But she is raising your taxes and I'm lowering your taxes.,0
Google "Donald Trump Iraq.",1
And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq. ,1
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that.,1
That in itself is a big difference.,0
We are going to be thriving again.,0
Now, why does that matter?,1
We have no growth in this country.,0
Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position.,1
There's no growth.,0
I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.,1
If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it's like a national catastrophe.,0
We're down at 1 percent.,0
But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay.,1
Mosul is a Sunni city.,1
Mosul is on the border of Syria.,1
And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice," and we brought him to justice.,1
And that's, like, no growth.,0
We need to go after the leadership.,1
But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters.,1
There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul.,1
They've been digging underground.,1
And we're going lower, in my opinion.,0
They've been prepared to defend.,1
It's going to be tough fighting.,1
But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa.,1
And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world.,0
This is what we have to do.,1
And I'm bringing them down to one of the lower in the world.,0
And I think it's so important -- one of the most important things we can do.,0
But she is raising everybody's taxes massively. ,0
Of course I do.,0
Of course I do.,0
I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks.,1
And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors.,0
I know many of her donors.,0
Her donors took massive tax write-offs. ,0
You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy. ,1
A lot of my -- excuse me, Anderson -- a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed.,0
He has all the conspiracy theories…,1
This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time. ,1
And she'll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it.,0
That's why.,0
He says…,1
... unfit, and he proves it every time he talks. ,1
See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that's ever run for president.,0
Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president.,1
And he has said... ,1
... as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America.,1
Hillary Clinton -- and it's extremely complex -- Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people.,0
But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary's leaving.,0
Very interesting why she's leaving carried interest.,0
I think he's right. ,1
Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict.,1
But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes.,0
I absolutely used it.,0
I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general.,1
And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from.,0
Now, I won't mention their names, because they're rich, but they're not famous.,0
This would not be done just on the first day.,1
So we won't make them famous. ,0
This would take a lot of negotiation.,1
And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground.,1
We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated.,1
So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS.,1
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees.,1
No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too.,0
But I have a write-off, a lot of it's depreciation, which is a wonderful charge.,0
I love depreciation.,0
You know, she's given it to us.,0
He's made these claims repeatedly.,1
Hey, if she had a problem -- for 30 years she's been doing this, Anderson.,0
I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in.,1
But I am not going to slam the door on women and children.,1
I say it all the time.,0
That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting.,1
And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting.,1
She talks about health care.,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0
That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks.,1
In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born.,1
So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it.,1
She talks about taxes.,0
Why didn't she do something about it?,0
She doesn't do anything about anything other than talk.,0
And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home. ,1
Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great.,1
And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades.,1
You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world.,1
With her, it's all talk and no action. ,0
And, again, Bernie Sanders, it's really bad judgment.,0
He was criticizing President Reagan.,1
She has made bad judgment not only on taxes.,0
She's made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq.,0
I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they've left, that's why ISIS formed in the first place.,0
This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage.,1
But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing.,1
They started from that little area, and now they're in 32 different nations, Hillary.,0
I do not add a penny to the national debt.,1
Congratulations.,0
Great job. ,0
I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with.,1
Why didn't you do it?,0
So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is.,1
We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.,1
Why didn't you do it?,0
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.,1
Oh, really? ,0
In fact, I think just the opposite.,1
You could have done it, if you were an effective -- if you were an effective senator, you could have done it.,0
If you were an effective senator, you could have done it.,0
But you were not an effective senator. ,0
She said a lot of things that were false.,0
We'll have what economists call middle-out growth.,1
We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America.,1
That's where growth will come from.,1
That's why I want to invest in you.,1
I want to invest in your family.,1
I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe... ,0
And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer.,1
And we just have a big disagreement about this.,1
Excuse me.,0
It may be because of our experiences.,1
You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire... ,1
I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man.,1
And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy. ,1
Because she has been a disaster as a senator.,0
A disaster.,0
First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which... ,0
Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund.,1
That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy.,1
OK.,0
But you were in contact -- excuse me.,0
You were...,0
You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you.,0
I don't think he would be listening to you very much anymore.,0
My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it.,1
Obama draws the line in the sand.,0
It was laughed at all over the world what happened.,0
Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia.,0
But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they've gone wild with their nuclear program.,0
Not good.,0
But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund... ,1
... by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it.,1
I will not cut benefits.,1
Our government shouldn't have allowed that to happen.,0
Russia is new in terms of nuclear.,0
I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system.,1
We are old.,0
We're tired.,0
We're exhausted in terms of nuclear.,0
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt.,1
A very bad thing.,0
Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad.,0
She talks in favor of the rebels.,0
That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare.,1
She doesn't even know who the rebels are.,0
You know, every time we take rebels, whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else, we're arming people.,0
And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal.,1
The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund.,1
And you know what happens?,0
They end up being worse than the people.,0
So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse.,1
Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi.,0
Gadhafi's out.,0
It's a mess.,0
What we need to do is go after... ,1
And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.,0
I'm sure you probably have heard that.,0
... the long-term health care drivers.,1
We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness.,1
I have a plan for doing that.,1
It was a disaster.,0
And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions. ,1
Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster.,0
Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone.,1
We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition.,1
But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn't there, but possibly she's consulted.,0
You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close.,1
And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you.,1
I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work.,1
We sign a peace treaty.,0
Everyone's all excited.,0
That's what my mission will be in the presidency.,1
Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I've ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough to fill up this room.,0
I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations.,1
I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college.,1
I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president. ,1
I want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders.,1
Last year, I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows.,1
It really was like seeing the future of America in one room.,1
I can't wait to see everything that they achieve.,1
But look at that deal.,0
Iran now and Russia are now against us.,0
So she wants to fight.,0
And I can't wait, if I'm fortunate enough to be president, to put some of them to work! ,1
And I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.,1
You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community ... when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off, at home in your districts and here in Washington.,1
She wants to fight for rebels.,0
There's only one problem.,0
You don't even know who the rebels are.,0
And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment we're at right now ... not just for Latinos but for our country.,1
My friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state, registered voters.,1
You've stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters.,1
By the way, I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious.,1
Now, here's a confession: Running for president is never easy, but it shouldn't be, right?,1
But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama.,1
So what's the purpose? ,0
He's always a tough act to follow, in more ways than one.,1
I, for one, don't think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression.,1
Think of what we've achieved these last eight years.,1
American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession.,1
And one thing I have to say.,0
I don't like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS.,0
Twenty million Americans have health coverage ... and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans.,1
We got more good news this week.,1
Russia is killing ISIS.,0
A report came out showing that poverty is going down, and incomes for American families are going up, and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all.,1
Now, that doesn't mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch.,1
And Iran is killing ISIS.,0
And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy. ,0
Our work is far from finished.,1
But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us.,1
OK.,0
He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree.,0
I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and it's big enough for everyone to share its promise.,1
I disagree. ,0
That doesn't mean that lots of people are still not hurting, because I know they are.,1
And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate, it's easy to get discouraged.,1
I think you have to knock out ISIS.,0
But we're here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our America's future.,1
Either we're going to make our economy work for everyone, or just those at the top.,1
Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS.,0
Either we're going to fear our differences, or embrace and celebrate our diversity.,1
Either we're going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides, or we're going to be stronger together.,1
We have people that want to fight both at the same time.,0
But Syria is no longer Syria.,0
Syria is Russia and it's Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly.,0
I believe we have to get ISIS.,0
We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved.,0
Today, as you know, we're in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month.,1
In classrooms across America, children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez, Juli..n and Joaqu..n Castro, Justice Sotomayor, Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez, Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda, and countless others ... names we know and names we might not know, but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations.,1
Whether you're Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Latin American, Afro-Latino, whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed [cheers], you're not strangers.,1
She had a chance to do something with Syria.,0
You're not intruders.,1
You're our neighbors, our col-leagues, our friends, our families.,1
You make our nation stronger, smarter, more creative.,1
They had a chance.,0
And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you, and time and again ... time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community, when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need, get the education you desire, compete for jobs, start new businesses, pursue your dreams, all of America benefits.,1
And that was the line.,0
As I said this afternoon in North Carolina, we are in the final stretch of this election.,1
And she didn't. ,0
And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career, fighting for kids and families.,1
I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise. ,0
That's been the cause of my life.,1
It will be the passion of my presidency.,1
So tonight I want to mention two things I'll do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America.,1
First, we do need to create an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
I think that it basically has fallen.,0
There's something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our country's population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth.,1
OK?,0
We've got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages, with more opportunities to get the skills they need, to go to college, to launch new ventures, to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids.,1
So we're going to make, in my first 100 days, the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, manufacturing, technology, innovative, clean energy. ,1
It basically has fallen.,0
Let me tell you something.,0
And we're going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses, including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere.,1
And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners.,1
Not everyone knows this, but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America.,1
You take a look at Mosul.,0
The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul.,0
And we're going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today.,1
Supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable childcare isn't a luxury, it's a necessity.,1
When families are strong, America is strong.,1
They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul.,0
So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks.,0
Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul.,0
And that brings me to another important family issue.,1
In those first 100 days, I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress.,1
My proposal will keep families together, and it will include a path to citizenship.,1
Why can't they do it quietly?,0
Now, I know this isn't the first time you've heard it.,1
Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success?,0
People leave.,0
In fact, people have been making the same promise for more than a decade.,1
But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on.,1
I've been called a lot of things; I've never been called a quitter. ,1
Why do they have to say we're going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they're saying?,0
How stupid is our country? ,0
And in this election ... in this election, we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn't just the smart thing to do, it's what the American people demand.,1
I can't think of any.,0
I can't think of any.,0
And I'm pretty good at it.,0
And you know how we'll show that?,1
And we have General Flynn.,0
And we have -- look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me.,0
Well, I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January.,1
I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me.,0
[Cheers.],1
We talk about it all the time.,0
They understand, why can't they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership?,0
But no matter what, on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say, this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party, the party of Lincoln, is better than Donald Trump. ,1
And while we're fighting for comprehensive immigration reform, we're going to keep families together.,1
How -- why would these people stay there?,0
I've been reading now... ,0
When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants, it was devastating to millions of families.,1
But the court didn't actually rule on the substance of the case.,1
... for weeks -- I've been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it's the harbor of where -- you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are.,0
Why would they be saying -- they're not staying there anymore.,0
They're gone.,0
And as I've said repeatedly, I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the President's authority, and will I protect them and keep fighting for them.,1
But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA, there's more we can do.,1
Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul.,0
We need a simple, straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too.,1
Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses.,1
Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can't believe it.,0
All I say is this.,0
And we won't stop there.,1
We're going to end family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and roundups.,1
General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we're doing in the Middle East. ,0
Everything.,0
You know what's funny?,0
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home.,1
She went over a minute over, and you don't stop her.,0
So here's the bottom line.,1
Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do, but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what it's always been ... a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family, start new businesses, pursue their dreams, apply their talents to American growth and innovation.,1
When I go one second over, it's like a big deal. ,0
It's really -- it's really very interesting.,0
Absolutely.,0
Now, I know this has been a long road and we wouldn't be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union, and we certainly wouldn't be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others.,1
I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable.,0
They helped change the conversation.,1
And when President Obama created DACA, it changed their lives.,1
I will be a president for all of our people.,0
And I'll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back.,0
Right now, 750,000 undocumented young people in America are going to school, working, and planning for their future.,1
They're DREAMers in much more than name.,1
Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world.,0
I've met so many.,1
I've listened to their stories.,1
They've done everything we've asked of them and made our country stronger in return.,1
So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One, when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us, including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented, these are the faces I see.,1
Not in this country.,0
It stripped us of manufacturing jobs.,0
We lost our jobs.,0
We lost our money.,0
I picture Astrid Silva ... who I met in Las Vegas.,1
We lost our plants.,0
It is a disaster.,0
And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she's for it.,0
She called it the gold standard.,0
And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn't say it.,0
They actually said that she lied.,0
OK?,0
Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing.,1
And she lied.,0
Now she's in her 20s, advocating for the rights of everywhere.,1
But she's lied about a lot of things. ,0
I would be a president for all of the people, African- Americans, the inner cities.,0
I picture a young man I never met, whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story.,1
Devastating what's happening to our inner cities.,0
She's been talking about it for years.,0
As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens.,0
She doesn't get it done.,0
His teacher told me that his former student was funny, enthusiastic, and patriotic.,1
Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans.,0
He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005, proudly enlisted in the U.S. Army.,1
The same exact thing.,0
They talk, they don't get it done.,0
You go into the inner cities and -- you see it's 45 percent poverty.,0
African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities.,0
Before shipping off to Iraq, he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform.,1
He was, his teacher wrote, 'as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom.',1
The education is a disaster.,0
Jobs are essentially nonexistent.,0
He was also a DREAMer, brought here as an undocumented child.,1
He loved America, and hoped one day to earn his citizenship.,1
I mean, it's -- you know, and I've been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose?,0
But in April 2007, while on a mission in Baghdad, he was killed by an improvised explosive device.,1
He was just 19.,1
It can't get any worse.,0
And she's been talking about the inner cities for 25 years.,0
Nothing's going to ever happen.,0
The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship he'd always wanted.,1
Let me tell you, if she's president of the United States, nothing's going to happen.,0
All these years later ... his teacher still treasures his memory.,1
And this teacher wanted me to know ... he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.,1
The truth is, this young man may not have been born here, but he represented the best values of our country.,1
We teach our children that America is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.,1
Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way, but for all.,1
Everywhere I go, people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric they've heard from my opponent ... from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge.,1
It's just going to be talk.,0
And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis.,0
She's not doing any me favors.,0
And every time we think he's hit rock bottom, he sinks even lower.,1
But by doing all the others' favors, she's doing me favors. ,0
But I will tell you, she's all talk.,0
His latest target?,1
It doesn't get done.,0
A minister in Flint, Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks.,1
He called her a nervous mess.,1
How insulting, how dead wrong.,1
Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess ... she's a rock for her community in trying times, and she deserves better and so does America.,1
And again today, he did it again.,1
All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run.,0
He was asked one more time, 'Where was President Obama born?',1
And he still wouldn't still say 'Hawaii.',1
Take a look at upstate New York. ,0
He still wouldn't say 'America.',1
This man wants to be our next president?,1
When will he stop this ugliness, this bigotry?,1
It turned out to be a disaster.,0
... but we believed that we could make the country better.,0
Now, he's tried to reset himself and his campaign many times.,1
And I was proud of that.,0
We have a divided nation.,0
We have a very divided nation.,0
You look at Charlotte.,0
You look at Baltimore.,0
You look at the violence that's taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have an increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years.,0
This is the best he can do.,1
This is who he is.,1
And so we need to decide who we are.,1
If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this, then what does that tell our kids about who we are?,1
We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric.,1
We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear.,1
We have a divided nation, because people like her -- and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart.,0
We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren,1
And when she said deplorables, she meant it.,0
And when she said irredeemable, they're irredeemable, you didn't mention that, but when she said they're irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. ,0
Parents and teachers are already worried about what they're calling the 'Trump Effect.',1
She's got tremendous -- she's got tremendous hatred.,0
And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that's what you're getting with her. ,0
Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools, especially targeting students of color, Muslims, and immigrants.,1
No, there wasn't check out a sex tape.,0
At a high school basket game in Indiana, white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of 'Build the wall' and 'Speak English.',1
It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. ,0
By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o'clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi.,0
She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?,0
Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes.,1
His message is you should be afraid ... afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different, or whose religious faith is different, or who were born in a different country.,1
Guess what?,0
She didn't answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens... ,0
There's no innuendo or dog whistles anymore.,1
It's all right out there in the open now.,1
... 600 -- wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times.,0
So we've got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear.,1
Just this week, a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son, Francisco.,1
Well, she said she was awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o'clock in the morning, but I won't even mention that.,0
But she said she'll be awake.,0
He's proud to be American, Colombian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican.,1
As he calls it, a 'potluck' of Hispanic heritage.,1
Who's going -- the famous thing, we're going to answer our call at 3 o'clock in the morning.,0
And Francisco has been following this election very closely, his mother told me.,1
Guess what happened?,0
Ambassador Stevens -- Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help.,0
And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who's her friend and not a good guy, by the way.,0
He wears his 'Love Trumps Hate' pin every day and refuses to take it off.,1
When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies, Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: 'I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in.,1
So, you know, she shouldn't be talking about that.,0
And I believe Trump is wrong.',1
And good for you, Francisco.,1
Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication.,0
That's what we have to do in this election, and that's what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from.,1
I mean, you can like it or not like it.,0
I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people.,0
It's a very effective way of communication.,0
Together, we must send this resounding message, and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket.,1
So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication.,0
I'm not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. ,0
We've set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted, and we can't do it without you.,1
I'm shocked to hear that.,0
Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35, and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election.,1
We have the slowest growth since 1929.,0
It is -- our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster.,0
Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently.,0
And we have a vacancy.,0
I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia.,0
I'm looking for judges -- and I've actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody.,0
So we're going to keep asking for your help.,1
Keep hitting the campaign trail.,1
But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States.,0
Please talk to your friends, your neighbors, your community ... everyone you see between now and November 8th.,1
And I think that this is so important.,0
Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.,0
They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents.,0
So important to me.,0
Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com, or text JOIN, J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved.,1
Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand.,0
This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines, as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez.,1
So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in -- of my money, meaning I'm not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she's doing.,0
So let's stand up for a future where we put families first.,1
What I ask is this.,0
Where we build bridges, not walls.,1
So I'm putting in more than -- by the time it's finished, I'll have more than $100 million invested.,0
And yes, together we can prove love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all very much.",1
Pretty much self-funding money.,0
Now, before I came out, I had the great, great privilege of saying hello to someone, Ruline Steininger, who is ... is Ruline still here?,1
I know she was going to try to stay.,1
There she is.,1
We're raising money for the Republican Party, and we're doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so.,0
Hello, Ruline!,1
Hello, Ruline!,1
I ask Hillary, why doesn't -- she made $250 million by being in office.,0
Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913.,1
She used the power of her office to make a lot of money.,0
I am so grateful for her support, and I don't know if any of you have seen the videos, both about Janelle and about Ruline.,1
Why isn't she funding, not for $100 million, but why don't you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign?,0
But I really do recommend that you see them both.,1
It's $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public.,0
Ruline talks about this long, active life that she's had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world.,1
Why aren't you putting some money in?,0
And I think it's important to have that perspective.,1
So it's a great honor to have Ruline supporting me.,1
I am so pleased.,1
And she's going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts. ,1
You have a lot of it.,0
I want to thank Dr. Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party, fighting so hard to elect Democrats.,1
And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate, Patty Judge.,1
You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office.,0
Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually.,0
So why aren't you putting money into your own campaign?,0
Where's Patty?,1
I'm just curious. ,0
Absolutely.,0
Patty's out there fighting hard every single day, and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate.,1
And Jim Mowrer, the 3rd District congressional candidate.,1
Jim is running a great campaign, and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington.,1
I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration.,0
But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa.,1
Now, while we're meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines, I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding.,1
I talked with the mayor.,1
I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so.,1
Under absolutely siege.,0
They hope that they will not have the flooding.,1
They took a lot of good precautionary measures.,1
The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies.,0
Our campaign, along with thousands of people, came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding.,1
And foreign companies are now coming in buying our -- buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil.,0
We are killing -- absolutely killing our energy business in this country.,0
Now, I'm all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera.,0
And I told them that if I'm so fortunate enough as to be president, we're going to have a big infrastructure program, and we're going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids. ,1
Now, I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey.,1
But we need much more than wind and solar.,0
That's very personal to me.,1
And you look at our miners.,0
Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business.,0
There is a thing called clean coal.,0
I live in New York.,1
People commute into New York from New Jersey.,1
Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country.,0
Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology.,0
We have unbelievable -- we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet.,0
So good.,0
Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt.,0
I will bring our energy companies back.,0
They'll be able to compete.,0
They'll make money.,0
They'll pay off our national debt.,0
We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died.,1
I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because it's a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage.,1
So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today.,1
Now, we are starting to vote in Iowa today!,1
And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin, and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today.,1
And we have, what, 40 days, 39 days, left.,1
They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous.,0
And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path.,1
We have 40 days to win an election that's going to affect the next 40 years of our country.,1
But we are putting our energy companies out of business.,0
And you, every one of you, can make the difference in this election.,1
We have to bring back our workers.,0
You take a look at what's happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies.,0
Now, how many of you participated in the caucuses?,1
Well, we've got a bunch of active Iowans here.,1
We have to guard our energy companies.,0
We have to make it possible.,0
The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business.,0
And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business.,0
Are you ready to go to the polls?,1
Well, luckily, in Iowa you can start today.,1
It's a disgrace. ,0
It's an absolute disgrace.,0
Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment.,0
Lots of folks don't have that opportunity across the country.,1
I don't know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great -- I'm very proud of my children.,0
And they've done a wonderful job, and they've been wonderful, wonderful kids.,0
So I consider that a compliment.,0
I will say this about Hillary.,0
She doesn't quit.,0
She doesn't give up.,0
I respect that.,0
And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites.,1
I tell it like it is.,0
We've got one right down the street.,1
She's a fighter.,0
So when you finish here, you can go vote.,1
And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa.,1
I disagree with much of what she's fighting for.,0
I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.,0
Any of you see that debate on Monday night?,1
But she does fight hard, and she doesn't quit, and she doesn't give up.,0
Well, one down, two to go.,1
Well, I have to tell you, it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something, not just against somebody.,1
And I consider that to be a very good trait. ,0
And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago, fighting for kids and families because it's been the cause of my life.,1
It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America.,1
And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work, their talent, will take them.,1
Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody.,0
Now, you may have heard me say this.,1
I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa.,1
The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about.,0
But I was very fortunate.,1
None of us picks our parents.,1
But I really was fortunate.,1
Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices.,0
Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent.,0
And she was forced to apologize.,0
And apologize she did.,0
But these were statements that should never, ever have been made.,0
My dad was a Navy veteran, a small businessman, and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security, a good, solid, middle class life.,1
We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege.,0
And I know how hard he worked because occasionally I'd go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies.,1
And it was not a very big building.,1
I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now.,0
But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma.,0
I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life.,0
It didn't have any natural life.,1
They will have a conservative bent.,0
There were no windows in it.,1
They will be protecting the Second Amendment.,0
It's what he could afford.,1
They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect.,0
They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted.,0
And I believe that's very, very important.,0
And there were two long tables.,1
I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear.,0
And he'd roll out the fabric, and then he would take a silkscreen.,1
Any of you ever seen a silkscreen, an old-fashioned silkscreen?,1
It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be.,0
Not far from here there's a wonderful t-shirt store.,1
And those are the people that I will appoint. ,0
Well, the D.C. vs. Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it.,0
Right?,1
I watched.,0
I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld.,0
And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing.,1
So he would take that silkscreen, and he'd put it down, and he would pour the paint in.,1
And Justice Scalia was so involved.,0
And it was a well-crafted decision.,0
But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry.,0
And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say. ,0
Well, let me just tell you before we go any further.,0
In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city.,0
Then he'd take a squeegee and he'd go across it.,1
And then he'd lift it up, and he'd go all the way down the table.,1
And if there was going to be more than one color, he'd do it all over again.,1
So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence.,0
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment.,0
And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA.,0
And then when he finished, he would gather it up and put it in his car and he'd go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it.,1
That's how I was raised to think about doing business.,1
And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president.,0
You do your best.,1
So I'm very honored by all of that.,0
We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment.,0
We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment. ,0
You enter into a contract or an agreement.,1
Right.,0
Somebody orders your goods or your services.,1
Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states. ,0
And then they pay you for it.,1
Right?,1
If they overturned it, it will go back to the states. ,0
Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen.,0
And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.,0
And as I said the other night, one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him, Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy.,1
I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination. ,0
Her words.,1
Well, I think it's terrible.,0
And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts, to pay what had been bargained for.,1
If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.,0
Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK.,0
I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldn't have survived all that.,1
All that work, and then to be told we're not going to pay you, or maybe we'll pay you 10 cents on the dollar, or 20 cents?,1
But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day.,0
That's just wrong.,1
What kind of person does that, takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people?,1
We've been looking into the records, and there's a long list of people who have been mistreated.,1
And that's not acceptable. ,0
And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth.,0
Nobody has that. ,0
I just don't believe that's the way we're supposed to treat each other in America.,1
Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years.,0
And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country. ,1
We need strong borders.,0
In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally.,0
Now, my mom had a very different story.,1
You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country.,0
They're coming in illegally.,0
Drugs are pouring in through the border.,0
My dad's father was a factory worker, but they had a strong family.,1
My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents, and they didn't want her.,1
So she was out on her own by the age of 14.,1
She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter.,1
We have no country if we have no border.,0
Hillary wants to give amnesty.,0
She wants to have open borders.,0
The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me.,0
First time they've ever endorsed a candidate.,0
It means their job is tougher.,0
But they know what's going on.,0
And it may sound harsh, but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other.,1
They know it better than anybody.,0
So for her, it was a gift.,1
And then she got another gift.,1
The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school.,1
And so the woman said, 'If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school, you can go to high school.,1
They want strong borders.,0
But you'll have to come right back.',1
That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old, but for my mother it made all the difference.,1
And that's exactly what she did for four years, and most days she had to run ... run ... to get there.,1
But she didn't care because she wanted to get an education.,1
They feel we have to have strong borders.,0
So when I learned more about my mom's life, I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families, and especially for kids who've been left out or left behind in some way.,1
That's why I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then, and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law, and boy, every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin, who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career.,1
I was up in New Hampshire the other day.,0
The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama.,0
So that's been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families?,1
And so when I talk about the economy ... because I think we have three big issues facing us.,1
Number one, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, right?,1
We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership, in accordance with our values.,1
And we need to bring our country together.,1
All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border.,0
We have to heal these divides.,1
It's just pouring and destroying their youth.,0
It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people.,0
But when I think about the economy, yes, I want more new, good jobs with rising in-comes.,1
I see my friends from the laborers here.,1
We have to have strong borders.,0
We have to keep the drugs out of our country.,0
We need to do work that builds our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, our tunnels, our water systems, our sewer systems.,1
We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash.,0
This is good, honorable work, and boy, do we have a lot of it in America.,1
We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents ... and sometimes even great-grandparents ... made.,1
If we're going to have a competitive economy, we need to be building America again.,1
And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing.,1
And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa.,1
I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that I've seen anywhere in the country.,1
And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers, and as designers using 3-D printing.,1
I was so impressed.,1
We need strong borders.,0
And I think we need to do that across America.,1
And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools.,1
It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools.,1
Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what you've done with clean renewable energy.,1
Now, it wasn't a partisan issue in Iowa.,1
We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty.,0
Now, I want to build the wall.,0
We need the wall.,0
It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor, Tom Vilsack.,1
But it's been continued over the years.,1
And look at the results.,1
Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources, most particularly wind.,1
Right?,1
And look at the number of jobs ... it's nearly 10,000 jobs now that are related to that.,1
And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall.,0
We stop the drugs.,0
We shore up the border.,0
One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out.,0
We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border.,0
And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest.,0
But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out. ,0
Chris, I think it's... ,0
I think I should respond to that.,0
First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico.,0
Very nice man.,0
We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals.,0
Believe me.,0
Plus the renewable fuel standard, which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material.,1
The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody.,0
It's a disaster.,0
I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future, and I'm excited by that.,1
I'm running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1
I know it's real.,1
I believe in science.,1
But I'll tell you what else is real.,1
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall.,0
What's real are the economic opportunities, the new jobs and businesses we're going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change, and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that.,1
Now, we also need to help small businesses.,1
Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts.,0
Iowa is filled with small businesses.,1
Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built.,0
But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall. ,0
We are a country of laws.,0
We either have -- and by the way...,0
Well -- well, but she said one thing. ,0
And the wall.,0
It should be easier to start one, it shouldn't be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations.,1
President Obama has moved millions of people out.,0
We're going to try to streamline that process.,1
Being the daughter of a small businessperson, I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands.,1
And we're going to work hard.,1
I want to be a first-class small business president, in honor of my dad, and I'm going to do everything I can to help you get started, and grow small businesses. ,1
Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it.,0
But while we're growing the economy, we need to make it fairer.,1
And here are a couple of things I want to do.,1
But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country.,0
Let's raise the national minimum wage, so people who work full-time are not still in poverty.,1
They've been deported.,0
I've met ... you know, two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women ... and I've met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America.,1
She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league.,0
Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs, because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15,000 at the end of a full-time year of work.,1
We also could give the biggest boost to incomes, and particularly family incomes, if we finally guaranteed equal pay for women's work.,1
And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing, so if you helped to create the profits, all of you, not just the top executives, will be able to share in those profits.,1
You know, at the debate the other night, one of my well-known supporters, Mark Cuban, was there in the front row.,1
As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't.,0
We're a country of laws.,0
And he really, I think, unsettled my opponent.,1
But I'll tell you, Mark Cuban's a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing, and not only while the business is ongoing, but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold, he shared the profits with all of his employees.,1
300 employees became millionaires, because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company, all together.,1
And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics.,1
We either have a border or we don't.,0
Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen.,0
You know, let's tackle the cost of childcare.,1
Between 2000 and 2012, childcare costs went up 25 percent.,1
Incomes barely budged, right?,1
So we're going to increase federal investment, and provide more tax relief to working families, so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare.,1
Now, if you don't have small children or grandchildren right now, you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities.,1
But it's very unfair.,0
We have millions of people that did it the right way.,0
They're on line.,0
They're waiting.,0
We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient.,0
A lot of families are just so stressed out.,1
But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens.,0
Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders.,0
You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders. ,0
But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is.,0
The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies, and provide paid family leave, so you can take care of your family members.,1
Thank you.,0
That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK?,0
Now, a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies, adopted babies, and of course that's a big part of it.,1
Last year, in Newton, a mom said to me, I'm counting on you to know what it's like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work.,1
Right?,1
How did we get on to Putin? ,0
So just to finish on the borders...,0
That's a lot of you.,1
She wants open borders.,0
There you are.,1
People are going to pour into our country.,0
Okay.,1
People are going to come in from Syria.,0
She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people.,0
And I've got to tell you, I hear that all over.,1
When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter, I was talking to one of the nurses, and I said, so what is your biggest worry?,1
She said, well, my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work.,1
They have no idea where they come from.,0
Right back to work.,1
But it's not just for babies.,1
It's for sick children, sick spouses, elderly members of your family who are having health problems.,1
And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country.,0
She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama.,0
So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders.,0
Now we can talk about Putin.,0
I don't know Putin.,0
There is nothing more important than caring for each other.,1
He said nice things about me.,0
And I will tell you, it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families.,1
The other big expense for family economics is education.,1
If we got along well, that would be good.,0
Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools, no matter what zip code they live in, right?,1
And we also have to make college affordable.,1
Yesterday in New Hampshire, I was with my friend and my former opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders.,1
If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good.,0
He has no respect for her.,0
He has no respect for our president.,0
And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads.,0
And she's playing chicken.,0
I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran.,1
It was a campaign about issues, not insults.,1
Look, Putin... ,0
And we shared a lot of the same goals, even though we have different ways of getting there.,1
... from everything I see, has no respect for this person. ,0
No puppet.,0
And so after it was over, he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together.,1
No puppet.,0
And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125,000 or less.,1
You're the puppet!,0
No, you're the puppet. ,0
And to make it debt-free for everybody else, so that you only pay what you can afford to pay, without going into debt.,1
Now, right now, Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans.,1
An education should give you a boost, not hold you back.,1
She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else. ,0
She has no idea.,0
And we're going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt.,1
Hillary, you have no idea. ,0
And our country has no idea.,0
We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America, 300,000 of them right here in Iowa.,1
We're going to help you refinance.,1
It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent, a car payment at 2 percent, and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8, 10, 12 percent interest on their student loans.,1
Yeah, I doubt it.,0
I doubt it. ,0
She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way.,0
Excuse me.,0
Putin has outsmarted her in Syria.,0
He's outsmarted her every step of the way.,0
I'll tell you what.,1
Yes, that's fine. ,0
By Russia or anybody else.,0
I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations.,1
Of course I condemn.,0
And college is crucial, but this is not said often enough.,1
Four-year college is not, and should not, be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life.,1
Of course I -- I don't know Putin.,0
So we're going to have real apprenticeships, not the kind where you're told, 'you're fired,' but the kind where you're told, 'you're hired.',1
I have no idea.,0
We're going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill.,1
So I'm excited about what we can do together.,1
I never met Putin.,0
I know so much of this campaign has been about, you know, whatever my opponent says, and who he attacks, and who he derides and denigrates.,1
This is not my best friend.,0
But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad.,0
And the list is long.,1
Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way.,0
But it's not about that.,1
It's about you.,1
It's about your families and your futures, and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job.,1
Now, I have this old-fashioned idea.,1
Whether it's Syria, you name it.,0
I'm asking for your vote.,1
Missiles.,0
I should tell you what I'm going to do, what my plans are.,1
Take a look at the "start up" that they signed.,0
So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book.,1
The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this.,0
They create warheads, and we can't.,0
And I see somebody holding one in the front row.,1
It's called, not surprisingly, 'Stronger Together.',1
The Russians can't believe it.,0
She has been outsmarted by Putin.,0
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East.,0
You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport, wherever they sell paperbacks.,1
They've taken over.,0
We've spent $6 trillion.,0
And you can see what we're trying to do, and where we're going to get the money to pay for it.,1
And the simple answer to that is, we're going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America.,1
They've taken over the Middle East.,0
She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever. ,0
Now, my friends, my opponent has a very different vision for America.,1
And she always will be.,0
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes, maybe not paying any taxes at all.,1
And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America.,1
Calling us a third world country.,1
Wrong.,0
I have 200 generals...,0
... and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients.,0
Saying our military is a disaster.,1
As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries.,0
We are spending a fortune doing it.,0
That everything about America is in bad shape.,1
They have the bargain of the century.,0
But then it's probably true, he hasn't paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military, or our vets, or our schools, or our roads, or our education systems.,1
He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes.,1
All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.,0
We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons. ,0
He says that makes him smart.,1
Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways.,0
This is just another lie. ,0
There's no quote.,0
Well, I'll tell you what, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make the rest of us?,1
My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public.,1
You can go and look at them, and you can see that we've been blessed, and we're grateful for that.,1
But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates, and we are glad we could, because we have both benefited from this great country of ours, and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that.,1
You're not going to find a quote from me.,0
Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9.,1
And defend yourselves.,0
And defend yourselves.,0
Think about that.,1
Five million families lost their homes.,1
And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it.,1
I didn't say nuclear.,0
He even said that it is just business.,1
Well, what kind of person believes that ... that throwing people out of their homes, foreclosing on them, destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business?,1
Well, I'll tell you, that's a person who should never be president because they don't understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it.,1
So look, I think after ...,1
Thank you.,1
And defend yourself.,0
Yes.,0
I think after what we saw Monday night, we'll have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare.,1
I have no idea what he's going to say the next time.,1
Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes.,0
But you know, I will spend some time preparing for it.,1
Her tax plan is a disaster.,0
And she can say all she wants about college tuition.,0
But we can't do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help.,1
The future of our country, the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot.,1
And I'm a big proponent.,0
It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited, divisive, bigoted things that are being said in our country.,1
We can have our differences, for heaven sakes.,1
We're Americans; that's in our DNA.,1
We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition.,0
But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it.,0
But we should respect one another.,1
We should listen to one another.,1
That's the way we're going to get things done together.,1
We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan. ,0
And so I want you to join this campaign.,1
But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries.,0
The election will be close, but we can win Iowa and we're going to win on November 8th.,1
So if you can, text 'Join,' J-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
Saudi Arabia, nothing but money.,0
We protect Saudi Arabia.,0
If you're not sure if you're registered, see these signs, 'I Will Vote?',1
Why aren't they paying?,0
She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO.,0
Iwillvote.com.,1
You can go to iwillvote.com, put in your name and your address, to make sure you're registered.,1
Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying?,0
Because sometimes people get dropped off the registration lists and they are surprised when they show up to vote that they're not on it.,1
Because they weren't paying.,0
Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying.,0
So check that out.,1
And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it.,0
And then, vote, and get everybody you know to vote.,1
All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up.,0
And I hope that a lot of you will go to vote after today, after this beautiful rally we're having.,1
They have to pay up.,0
We're protecting people, they have to pay up.,0
Because we will prove that we are stronger together.,1
And I'm a big fan of NATO.,0
But they have to pay up.,0
And you know what else we'll prove?,1
She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great.,0
Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are.,0
We will prove that love trumps hate.,1
We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out.,0
We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt.,0
We're up to $20 trillion.,0
So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals.,0
Thank you all very much.",1
We're going to have a lot of free trade.,0
We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now.,0
But we have horrible deals.,0
Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever.,0
And I've got to recognize Joshua Simmons, who just introduced me.,1
Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy.,0
He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School, and boy, are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm.,1
And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked, and his sister who he helped to raise.,1
You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them.,0
You go upstate New York.,0
Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places.,0
We're bringing our jobs back.,0
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA.,0
And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals.,0
We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal.,0
We really are stronger together, and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities.,1
And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster.,0
We are going to cut taxes massively.,0
We're going to cut business taxes massively.,0
Well, you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you, starting with my great friend and former colleague, your Senator Bill Nelson.,1
And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together.,1
And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy.,1
I think Florida deserves a full-time senator, don't you?,1
They're going to start hiring people.,0
We're going to bring the $2.5 trillion... ,0
And I want to thank my friend, someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America ... Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.,1
... that's offshore back into the country.,0
We are going to start the engine rolling again, because... ,0
And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember ...,1
I'm so pleased he's here with us ...,1
Congressman Alcee Hastings.,1
And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch, who represents this district ... is over in Israel for the funeral of a great, great man, Shimon Peres, and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work.,1
... right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP. ,0
You can't.,0
Correct.,0
Before I get started and really talk about everything that's at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election, I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez.,1
When he left Cuba, he did not speak a word of English.,1
He didn't let that stop him.,1
Over a 10-year period.,0
So I just left some high representatives of India.,0
They're growing at 8 percent.,0
He pursued his dreams.,1
He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen.,1
And he never forgot where he came from.,1
China is growing at 7 percent.,0
He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him.,1
Jose's life really embodied the American dream, and at 24 years of age, he was just getting started.,1
I'm sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family, with his fans, and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career.,1
I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs, and that's a man named Bob Levinson.,1
And that for them is a catastrophically low number.,0
We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level.,0
My heart goes out to Bob's family.,1
He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago, and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family.,1
And I think it's going down.,0
Now, did any of you see the debate the other night?,1
Well, I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have.,1
Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report.,0
A terrible jobs report.,0
In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election?,0
My view is we are already great, and if we work together, we will become even greater in the years ahead.,1
Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad.,0
I believe America is an exceptional nation.,1
My opponent believes America is in decline.,1
I've never heard such a dark and divisive, terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States.,1
The report was so bad.,0
Look, our country is stagnant.,0
When he talks, I lots of times don't even recognize the country he's talking about.,1
We've lost our jobs.,0
We've lost our businesses.,0
We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking.,0
And why are we already great?,1
Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world.,0
I've visited so many communities.,0
Well, it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military.,1
This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris.,0
It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country.,1
I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets.,1
This morning, I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America, serve their communities.,1
I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year.,0
And they cry when they see what's happened.,0
Because America is great, when you really strip it all down, because America is good.,1
And we can't ever forget that.,1
I have laid out specific plans about how we're going to make our country even greater.,1
I've actually got a book here with Tim Kaine, my running mate.,1
I have this old-fashioned idea: if I'm asking you for your vote for president, I should tell you what I'm going to do.,1
I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities.,0
Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left.,0
Boy, did they suffer.,0
That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country.,0
I shouldn't just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do, but to lay out how we're going to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top. ,1
That means new jobs ... new jobs with rising incomes, jobs in infrastructure, jobs in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, and yes, clean, renewable energy jobs.,1
My opponent's only infrastructure plan is to build a wall.,1
I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked.,1
Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
And she wants it.,0
She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates.,0
She totally lied.,0
She did call it the gold standard.,0
He didn't even raise it.,1
He's been going around telling people for months, 'We're going to build a wall and we're going to make Mexico pay for it.',1
So he's sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesn't even bring it up.,1
He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall.,1
I mean, really, who gets up at 3 o'clock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe?,1
And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right.,0
I mean, he hurled as many insults as he could.,1
I was so honored. ,0
Really, why does he do things like that?,1
And that will be as bad as NAFTA.,0
I mean, his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged, even for him.,1
It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
Well, let me just say -- let me just say. ,0
I have said it before and I'll say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes.,1
Let me ask a simple question.,0
So I'm going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election.,1
She's been doing this for 30 years.,0
Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years? ,0
You were very much involved -- excuse me.,0
My turn.,0
You were very much involved in every aspect of this country.,0
Getting those new jobs.,1
And I'll tell you, another area I want to emphasize is small business.,1
As I said the other night, my dad was a small businessman.,1
He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good, solid, middle-class life.,1
Very much.,0
I'm really proud of that.,1
And you do have experience.,0
I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly.,0
And I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, who stiffs small businesses, doesn't pay his bills to people like my dad.,1
For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that.,0
But we need to do more to get small business started and growing ... here in Broward County, throughout South Florida, across the state, and beyond.,1
I wouldn't mind.,0
The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary.,0
You don't.,0
So as we grow the economy, we also have to make it fairer.,1
Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing.,0
I want prosperity to reach everyone, not just the privileged few.,1
So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time, you should not still be in poverty.,1
And you know, two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women, most of them supporting kids.,1
How do you miss $6 billion?,0
And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job, at the end of the year you've made $15,000.,1
I think we can do better.,1
And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them. ,1
You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen.,0
Something else we're going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for women's work.,1
Now, this is not, my friends, just a women's issue.,1
They don't know.,0
If you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, a sister, who is working, it's your issue, too, to make sure she is paid fairly.,1
It's gone, $6 billion.,0
That will raise family incomes.,1
And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure ... to make sure ... more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place.,1
The other night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban.,1
He was sitting in the front row.,1
If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess.,0
Believe me. ,0
And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing.,1
Give me a break.,0
He's always, in his companies, shared profits.,1
Well, I think I did a much better job.,0
I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars.,0
I started with a $1 million loan.,0
I agree with that.,0
And by the way, he is a real billionaire.,1
And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him, who helped to make him a success, became millionaires.,1
I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America.,1
It's a $1 million loan.,0
And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing.,1
It is hard to balance family and work, isn't it?,1
I think we can do better.,1
But I built a phenomenal company.,0
And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of.,0
You would even be proud of it.,0
I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college. ,1
And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria.,0
Now, after the primary was over ... and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary, but you know what?,1
Take a look at the migration.,0
Take a look at Libya.,0
I was really proud.,1
We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults.,1
Take a look at Iraq.,0
He and I got together and we said, okay, what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education?,1
Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford.,1
And if you go into debt, you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you.,1
So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together, and we were rolling out our plan.,1
And it's pretty simple.,1
You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly.,1
She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out.,0
If you are in a family that makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university.,1
She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there.,0
And if you make more than that, you will pay what you can afford, but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go.,1
And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries.,0
And we put together a calculator on my website.,1
You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save, how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan.,1
And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS.,0
But I also believe a four-year college degree, which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead, should not leave you mired in debt.,1
She's going to get rid of nobody. ,0
Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked.,0
Those people -- I don't know those people.,0
So we are going to help you refinance your debt, get the interest rates down, and if you're willing to do public service, national service, we're going to forgive your debt over time. ,1
I have a feeling how they came.,0
But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree.,1
I want every person, not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain ...,1
I believe it was her campaign that did it.,0
I want to everybody to have a chance for a good, solid job.,1
I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school.,1
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence?,0
She's the one and Obama that caused the violence.,0
We need to put technical education back into high school.,1
They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things.,0
I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that.,0
And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job.,1
And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs ... not the kind that lead to being told, 'You're fired,' the kind that lead to being told, 'You're hired.',1
And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything.,0
I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women.,0
Now, I'm excited about this.,1
I really am.,1
These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it.,0
I am confident and optimistic about our country.,1
We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else.,1
That's not who we are as Americans.,1
And I think it's her campaign.,0
Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence.,0
We need to lift ourselves up, and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country.,1
And while we're doing that, we're going to make sure that our country's safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world.,1
And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot.,0
And that was now all on tape, started by her.,0
Sometimes, when I listen to my opponent, it kind of seems he doesn't know who our friends are versus our adversaries.,1
I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward.,0
If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame.,0
But they were all totally -- it was all fiction.,0
It was lies, and it was fiction. ,0
I did not say that.,0
I did not say that.,0
He has this weird fascination with dictators.,1
He's kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list.,1
I did not say that.,0
Nobody has more respect for women than I do.,0
Nobody.,0
He doesn't care whether NATO falls apart, and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons.,1
He said he doesn't care.,1
Let Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia, get a nuclear weapon.,1
Nobody has more respect...,0
And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked.,0
And I really want to just talk about something slightly different.,0
Whoa!,1
She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign.,0
But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.,0
What happened to the FBI, I don't know.,0
That's the kind of dangerous, reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to.,1
We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI.,0
One lie.,0
She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI.,0
As I told him in the debate ... he actually said, 'Well, we may or may not defend our allies in Asia.',1
Words matter.,1
He's going to probably go to jail.,0
This is a four-star general.,0
And America's word matters.,1
We have to be reliable and trustworthy.,1
People have to count on us.,1
And we've got a lot of work to do around the world.,1
We need to work hard for peace and prosperity.,1
We need to tackle climate change together. ,1
And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States?,0
Climate change is real.,1
Florida knows that.,1
My opponent thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents.,1
You see, some country's going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century.,1
I think it's going to be either China, Germany, or us.,1
I want it to be us, and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen.,1
Let's deploy a half a billion more solar panels.,1
Let's produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it.,1
There's so much we can do together.,1
That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign. ,0
Wrong.,0
And that means we've got to work with other countries and we've got to demonstrate that we support our allies, whether they're in Europe, the Middle East with Israel, or Asia, that we stand with those who stand with us.,1
So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence.,0
It's on tape. ,0
And then, finally, one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together.,1
The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things... ,0
... but those other charges, as she knows, are false. ,0
I think that it's been very well...,0
It's been very well studied.,0
I've got to tell you, look, disagreements, political disagreements, that's fine.,1
... and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it. ,0
That's who we are.,1
It's a criminal enterprise.,0
I don't know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other.,1
And I've known, been fortunate enough to know, a number of our more recent presidents.,1
I didn't always agree with them either, including my husband.,1
But I'll tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike, I never doubt they were trying to put the country's interests first.,1
Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries.,0
They were trying to bring people together, not pit us against each other.,1
And one of the things I will do from the very beginning, the very first day of my administration...",1
You talk about women and women's rights?,0
So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings.,0
These are people that kill women and treat women horribly.,0
<i>Audience Member:</i> "Day one.",1
And yet you take their money.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> "...is to make them day one ... you're right ... is to make sure everybody in the country knows I'm the president of every American, every single per-son.,1
Now ... so in order for me to do any of this, anything that's in this book and making sure that it's paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally, all of that, depends upon whether we win in November.,1
The stakes could not be higher.,1
So here is what I am asking all of you.,1
How many of you know you are registered to vote?,1
So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly?,0
So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th.,1
If you've moved, you may need to reregister.,1
Here's how you can find out if you are registered.,1
You can go to iwillvote.com, iwillvote.com.,1
You put in your name.,1
Why don't you give back the money?,0
I think it would be a great gesture.,0
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money.,0
You put in your address and make sure you're registered.,1
And you take a look at the people of Haiti.,0
I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida.,0
If you need to get registered, we have volunteers here.,1
And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace.,0
And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it. ,0
They don't want you to help them anymore.,0
I'd like to mention one thing.,0
Trump Foundation, small foundation.,0
People contribute, I contribute.,0
Right?,1
The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military.,0
I don't get anything.,0
And they will ... they have ... they have clipboards.,1
We're kind of low-tech about it.,1
I don't buy boats.,0
They have clipboards.,1
I don't buy planes.,0
They can help you get registered right here and now or, as I say, you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration.,1
And, remember, you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward.,1
And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure they're registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience.,1
So make no mistake.,1
What happens -- the money goes to them. ,0
No, it was -- we put up the American flag.,0
This election is going to be close.,1
And that's it.,0
They put up the American flag.,0
We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag. ,0
They always are.,1
So every call you make, every door you knock on, every person you register could make the difference.,1
So I'm asking you to go ahead and text JOIN, text JOIN, J?O?I?N, to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com.,1
And you can volunteer and become involved.,1
There was.,0
There was.,0
If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it, we win Florida.,1
And, by the way... ,0
... the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets. ,0
And, like I say, I'm not just excited about winning an election.,1
So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it.,0
I'm excited about doing the work.,1
I'm excited about listening to Americans.,1
And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars... ,0
Let me just explain.,0
Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do.,0
I'll continue to travel our country.,1
I'll be here in Florida so much you'll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida.,1
You know what she should have done?,0
I mean, Florida is already suffering from climate change, and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase.,1
And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator... ,0
... because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so. ,0
That's kind of hard to believe.,1
So there's a lot we're going to do together: jobs, rising incomes, opportunities.,1
And that's what gets me excited.,1
So here's what I hope you will do.,1
When you leave here, if somebody says, 'Where were you this afternoon?',1
you say, 'Oh, I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton.',1
You should have changed the law.,0
If they say, 'Oh, that's great," get them registered.,1
But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money.,0
I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump... ,0
But I will tell you, I sat there…,0
If they say, 'Oh, my gosh.,1
...,0
I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad.,0
All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them.,0
How can you do that?',1
if they're seriously thinking about voting for my opponent, stage an intervention, really, because, remember, remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.,1
And, frankly, you should have changed the laws. ,0
If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws. ,0
And what we believe and what we're going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all so much.",1
I will look at it at the time.,0
And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction.,1
I'm not looking at anything now.,0
I'll look at it at the time.,0
What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad.,0
We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work, and now that she is retired, she is volunteering for our campaign.,1
First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing.,0
The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care.,0
It's so dishonest.,0
And they've poisoned the mind of the voters.,0
But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it.,0
This woman never quit, and Eileen, we are so glad you are on our team.,1
I am grateful to all of the elected officials, all of the commissioners, the county commissioners, Martin County, St. Lucie, for all you do for the community, but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water, that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses.,1
This is a serious and complicated problem, isn't it, for the entire Treasure Coast.,1
And it is a reminder, if we needed it, how important good leadership is.,1
So, I thank all the leaders for their commitment.,1
Now, there are just 39 days between now and November 8th.,1
I think they're going to see through it.,0
We'll find out on November 8th.,0
But I think they're going to see through it. ,0
Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes.,1
If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote.,0
We've got to make every single day count.,1
So let me just give you one other thing.,0
So I talk about the corrupt media.,0
I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing.,0
We have to get more people registered to vote, get more people committed to turn out to vote.,1
We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families, safer communities and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
She shouldn't be allowed to run.,0
It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime.,0
And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth, this campaign really comes down to two questions.,1
She should not be allowed to run.,0
What kind of future we want for ourselves, our kids and our grandkids, and how do we make it a reality?,1
And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never... ,0
Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things. ,0
Now, as I said it the other night ... how many of you saw the debate?,1
What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time.,0
Well as I said, I now have two grandchildren, and no offense to anybody, the two most wonderful, amazing, extraordinary.,1
I'll keep you in suspense.,0
OK?,0
A little girl and a little boy.,1
Should have gotten it.,0
I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful.,0
I think it's a disgrace. ,0
I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country.,0
So I think a lot about the future.,1
Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad.,0
We had Mosul.,0
But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul.,0
And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about ... well, nearly everything when it gets right down to it ... not just about what makes America great, because I think America already is great ... but about what we should do to make it even greater, and about that basic question about how progress happens at all.,1
My opponent believes in what I call a 'strongman approach.',1
Now we're fighting again to get Mosul.,0
The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul.,0
About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul.,0
Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK?,0
He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless, broken nation.,1
I am sorry, I am looking at you.,1
We announce we're going after Mosul.,0
I don't see that.,1
That in no way resembles the strong, vibrant America I know.,1
And here's what he said.,1
He said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
I alone?,1
Well, we have learned that that's his way.,1
I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months?,0
One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly.,1
These people have all left.,0
That's why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much.,1
But that's not how change happens in America.,1
They've all left.,0
It's never just one person, not even someone as powerful as the president.,1
Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality.,1
Not just the wealthy or the powerful ... all of us.,1
The element of surprise.,0
We see that every day across America, and I bet many of you have been a part of it.,1
Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country.,0
Maybe you taught kids to read, right?,1
Or cleaned up your local park, or the beach, maybe you have organized a cancer walk, or you have run a food drive.,1
Whatever it is, chances are you have done something to serve your community.,1
And by extension, your country.,1
How many of you ... just think back over your lives ... how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community, for other people.,1
So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had.,0
All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it.,0
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it?,0
And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough.,0
They want to look good.,0
He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes.,0
That's why we have the great migration.,0
But she wanted to look good for the election.,0
The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year.,1
It's one of the best things about the American people.,1
So they're going in.,0
We are doers.,1
But who's going to get Mosul, really?,0
We'll take Mosul eventually.,0
But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought.,0
We don't just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing, we don't get resigned or pathetic, or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats.,1
Much, much tougher.,0
Much more dangerous.,0
Going to be more deaths that they thought.,0
We roll up our sleeves, we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood, our community, our city, our state, our country.,1
This has been our story, the American story, since the beginning of our nation, and it is still going strong today.,1
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart.,0
Now, for many Americans, including a lot of you here, serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces.,1
They say, what do we need this for?,0
So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing.,0
People are starting to call out their services!,1
There is no greater service or sacrifice, and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform, to their families and our veterans every single day.,1
And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons.,0
But what's so great is that national service can take many different forms, and it's something that I believe in so deeply, that every stage of our lives gives us the chance, from grade school through grandparenthood, to find a way to give back.,1
We've got folks here today from AmeriCorps, which my husband created back in 1993, and I'll tell you, to this day, it is one of his proudest achievements.,1
Because very day, AmeriCorps volunteers are out there.,1
Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.,0
So we're now going to take Mosul.,0
And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary?,0
Iran.,0
They're building houses, responding to natural disasters, helping people with disabilities find jobs, find safe places to live, and next week, on October 7th, AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member.,1
I'll tell you, Bill is really excited about this and so am I.,1
And by the way, AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard.,1
Here's how it starts: 'I will get things done for America.',1
Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision.,0
But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq.,0
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it.,0
Isn't that great?,1
I think we should make that a national slogan.,1
You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way. ,0
The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran. ,0
Now we also have folks here today from City Year, which is part of AmeriCorps.,1
Wrong.,0
Wrong.,0
And every day, they're working with students who are risk of dropping out of school.,1
They're tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs ... all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school.,1
Wrong.,0
I'm really grateful to them.,1
We also have people here today from the Peace Corps, which represents the best of America to the world.,1
Chris, we don't gain anything. ,0
Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo, staffing health centers in Nicaragua, supporting farmers in Nepal, distributing malaria nets in Uganda.,1
Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State, I got to see the results of their work first hand.,1
They are making the world a healthier, more prosperous and more peaceful place.,1
Now, maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs, but I know you serve in different ways.,1
Maybe you volunteer through your school, or with your church or synagogue.,1
Iran is taking over Iraq.,0
Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities, as I did when I was a teenager, service opportunities.,1
Iran is taking over Iraq.,0
Because for many Americans, service is part of our faith.,1
My running mate, Tim Kaine, volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man, and it changed his life.,1
Or maybe your whole family volunteers together, Bill and Chelsea and I, every holiday season, would work at a food bank back in Arkansas.,1
We don't gain anything.,0
If they did it by surprise…,0
However you serve, it feels good, doesn't it?,1
To be part of something bigger than ourselves.,1
We could have gained if they did it by surprise.,0
To take our time and labor, and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world.,1
And you know something very interesting?,1
No, you are the one that's unfit.,0
You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right.,0
He said some beauties.,0
And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment.,0
Service makes us happier, it makes us healthier, and there are studies proving that.,1
You do.,0
It's not just how we feel, they've actually followed people.,1
And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone.,0
If you think that was good, then you do.,0
It can also help us find our next job, or our true calling in life.,1
It's a smart way to use our greatest asset in life, our people.,1
Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts.,0
Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment.,0
I agree with both. ,0
Which is a big mistake.,0
And service does something important for us as a society.,1
It's a catastrophe.,0
I mean...,0
... it's a mess.,0
Too often, we Americans can become separated from each other, and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election.,1
It's easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us, talk like us, look like us, read the same news as us, that's understandable to an extent.,1
Have you seen it?,0
Have you seen it?,0
Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo?,0
OK, so it hasn't fallen.,0
Take a look at it. ,0
That's right.,0
But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences, which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us.,1
There aren't many places where people of all ages, all races, all backgrounds, all beliefs come together in common cause.,1
And they are being slaughtered...,0
... because of bad decisions.,0
But service is one of them, and that's one of the reasons I think it's so valuable, because in addition to the good work it does, it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life.,1
Well, Aleppo is a disaster.,0
It's a humanitarian nightmare.,0
I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service, to help more Americans answer President Kennedy's call.,1
But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint.,0
I mean, what do you need, a signed document?,0
Take a look at Aleppo.,0
You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.',1
It is so sad when you see what's happened.,0
But sometimes it's hard to figure out.,1
And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama.,0
And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago.,0
He -- he aligned with Russia.,0
He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful.,0
We gave them $150 billion back.,0
We give them $1.7 billion in cash.,0
How do you make a difference, especially with everything else going on in our lives?,1
And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do.,1
But that's not how it should be.,1
I mean, cash.,0
Bundles of cash as big as this stage.,0
Everyone should be able to contribute.,1
So what if we, as a country, made it easier for everybody to do that, for everybody to give back?,1
We gave them $1.7 billion.,0
What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages, invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses?,1
Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran.,0
What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasn't just something that we did one day a year, but it became a regular part of our lives.,1
They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels.,0
I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America.,1
We don't know who the rebels are.,0
I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation.,1
We're not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy.,1
We're exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people.,1
We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything.,0
We don't know who the rebels are.,0
And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now.,0
Way back, nearly 200 years ago, a Frenchman came to the United States, his name was Alexis de Tocqueville.,1
He was travelling around, trying to figure out, 'What is this new place called America?,1
They fought a revolution.,1
But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad.,0
If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape.,0
Who are they?',1
And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely... ,0
... in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse.,0
And wait until you see what happens in the coming years.,0
Lots of luck, Hillary.,0
Thanks a lot for doing a great job. ,0
But I just have to...,0
It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS.,0
We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place.,0
And he saw how we had set up our government, and we had three branches, and everything that our founders really put into place.,1
But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible.,1
If I'm elected president this fall, I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service.,1
So here's what I plan to do.,1
First, let's triple AmeriCorps.,1
That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy.,1
It was laid out in a law named in his honor, the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.,1
It's finally time we get it done.,1
Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program, so if we grow the program from 75,000 annual members to 250,000, we're going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so.,1
Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service, and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented, committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because, with their student loans, they can't afford it.,1
And right now, they're in 32 countries. ,0
So let's lighten that burden.,1
If you do national service, we will begin a program to forgive your loans, because you are giving back to your country.,1
And let's keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to.,1
Now second, let's grow the Peace Corps.,1
Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago, it's given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime, and it's fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations.,1
We've got to do more of that in the world today.,1
We should have -- wait one second.,0
We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values, serving people.,1
They had a cease-fire three weeks ago.,0
So let's make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program.,1
A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria.,0
And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore.,0
Third, let's expand service opportunities for people of all ages.,1
Right?,1
We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires.,0
They are outplayed.,0
Now, let's be fair, the younger generation is way ahead on this.,1
Now, she wasn't there.,0
I assume she had nothing to do with it.,0
But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran.,0
Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is. ,0
Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs.,0
And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero.,0
But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent.,0
And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent.,0
I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent.,0
I've talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world.,1
And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine.,0
Service isn't just something to do to check a box before graduation, it really is woven into your lives.,1
We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again.,0
To do that, we're taking back jobs.,0
We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore.,0
It's very sad.,0
And many who are just getting started in your careers, say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes, may pay a salary but doesn't give you any meaning or purpose in your lives.,1
But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry.,0
We used to be there.,0
We've given it up.,0
Now I also want to get older Americans more involved.,1
We've become very, very sloppy.,0
We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies.,0
You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say.,0
Service isn't something only students and young people do.,1
But we don't use those people.,0
Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world.,0
I know that.,1
So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55.,1
We have the greatest businesspeople in the world.,0
We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals.,0
We use political hacks.,0
Let's give people an encore opportunity after they've ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community.,1
And finally, I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious, meaningful ways without a full time commitment.,1
AmeriCorps is a full time commitment.,1
We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are.,0
So we have to use our great people.,0
But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades.,0
And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money.,0
The Peace Corps is a full time commitment.,1
The Armed Forces are a full time commitment.,1
But the Armed Forces has another model.,1
And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new. ,0
The Reserves ... right?,1
It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways.,1
Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary. ,0
We've heard this before.,0
Thank you, Hillary.,0
Could I just respond? ,0
So let's do something like that in the civilian space.,1
Let's call it the National Service Reserve.,1
And here's the idea.,1
If you join the National Service Reserve, you will receive some basic training, just like you would in the military reserves, and then when your city or state needs you, you'll get the call.,1
Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck.,1
Or maybe, like the crisis in Flint, and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families.,1
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade.,0
Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health.,1
I disagreed with him.,0
You will then be sent into action.,1
We should have been much tougher on trade even then.,0
Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days, a month, some might be longer term.,1
I've been waiting for years.,0
Nobody does it right.,0
And frankly, now we're going to do it right. ,0
I'm cutting taxes.,0
But they will directly address a vital need in your own community.,1
We're going to grow the economy.,0
It's going to grow at a record rate of growth.,0
And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student, having a job, taking care of your family.,1
You won't have to make service your only priority.,1
No, it's going to totally help you.,0
And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states, and we will have an open door to people of all ages, but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 who've said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities, but they can't leave their jobs, understandably.,1
We'll work with governors and mayors, Republicans and Democrats, because I want this to be a true bipartisan, public-private partnership.,1
It's destroying our country.,0
It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses.,0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster.,0
I also want to include businesses, colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer.,1
If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight.,0
And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution, their schools and their employers will have their backs.,1
But Obamacare has to go.,0
I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states.,1
There's so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it.,1
It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent.,0
Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent.,0
So let's bridge that divide, get people working together in ways that can help communities.,1
Now, I don't think you'll hear anything about this from my opponent.,1
And you know what?,1
I think that's a shame, because national service has always been a bipartisan goal.,1
Of course, President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps ... but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act.,1
And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse.,0
Bad health care at the most expensive price.,0
We have to repeal and replace Obamacare. ,0
President George H.W.,1
Such a nasty woman.,0
Bush created the White House Office of National Service.,1
Your husband disagrees with you.,0
And both President George W. Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service.,1
She's raising the money from the people she wants to control.,0
This should be something that we all can get behind.,1
And when you listen to what's being said in this campaign, it can be discouraging, right?,1
Doesn't work that way.,0
But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly.,0
It's called "Make America Great Again.",0
We're going to make America great.,0
We have a depleted military.,0
It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where, whenever we can.,1
It has to be helped, has to be fixed.,0
Now, I am well aware that candidates don't usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election.,1
We have the greatest people on Earth in our military.,0
We don't take care of our veterans.,0
We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets.,0
Some might say, 'Well hey, my gosh, you've only got 39 days to go.,1
Why aren't you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it?,1
That can't happen.,0
Our policemen and women are disrespected.,0
Well, I'll do that, but ...,1
We need law and order, but we need justice, too.,0
I've been thinking about this for a long time, and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me.,1
I'm trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart ... and this is one of them.,1
Thank you!,1
For me, service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith, and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: 'Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.',1
Now, I've carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl, and it's an idea that really got into my head and my heart.,1
Our inner cities are a disaster.,0
But you know what's kept me going are the people that I've met.,1
And in a country founded on liberty and equality, I can't think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable.,1
You get shot walking to the store.,0
We all deserve respect.,1
We all should listen to each other.,1
We all can make our mark on the world.,1
And when we come together in common purpose, we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own.,1
That's why 'Stronger Together' is more than just a slogan.,1
They have no education.,0
They have no jobs.,0
It's a course of action.,1
I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes.,0
So here's what I want to do.,1
I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency.,1
And I want you to help me bring our nation together ... to solve our problems, strengthen our communities.,1
All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years.,0
We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now.,0
To join with people across America who care about service, because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States.,1
America is great because we are good.,1
We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her. ,0
We are at a decisive moment in this election.,0
Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.,0
Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
There are lots of examples.,1
Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness. ,0
We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations.,1
Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.,0
But I want everybody here to know that it can be done.,1
We can do more, and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people.,1
There are so many examples in this community and communities across America ... 39 days left.,1
This is the choice: do we lift each other up, or do we tear each other down?,1
Do we listen and respect each other, or do we scapegoat, point fingers, and insult each other?,1
The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.,0
Well, I'll tell you what side I'm going to be on, and with your help, we're going to demonstrate on November 8th, what kind of country we really are.,1
Thank you and God bless you!",1
Law and order must be restored.,0
I am so [...] and so honored to be here.,1
Thank you so much Reverend Dr. Walker.,1
It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.,0
The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.,0
It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result.,0
There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.,0
Thanks to the members of the Little Rock A.M.E. Zion.,1
Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.,0
The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.,0
The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.,0
More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.,0
I have to confess ... we were putting together the [...] Rev.,1
Walker was [...],1
But he told me his church [...] 134 years ago was founded in a house on a rock and that rock has been sturdy and steady [...],1
Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police.,0
You know it, and I know it.,0
I am so delighted to be here with your Congresswoman, Congresswoman Adams, who has a [...] path in the Congress, such a [...] of conviction.,1
And my thanks also to Donna [...] for her leadership for that stirring description [...] Thank you so much.,1
This church for all those years has been a source of strength and solace, for generations of congregants and [...] It has helped people get [...].,1
It has helped people deal with the sorrows that come [...] and it has [...] the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief.,1
In here, in this magnificent house of worship, we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls.,1
Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society ... a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent ... share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.,0
In here, we are called to confront injustice, even when the world out there fails to see it.,1
In here, we see the world as it is, but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be.,1
They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.,0
It has been 12 days since Mr. Scott was shot and killed.,1
Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives ... whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore ... and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.,0
Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die, and seven children lost their father.,1
Now we don't yet know all the details about the shooting, but we do know this family and this community is in pain.,1
And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses.,1
During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.,0
But we do more than pray.,1
More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began.,0
How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?,0
As Ms. Bradford said, 'We do what each of us can do.',1
Not everyone can march, but everyone can talk, and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote.,1
The war on our police must end.,0
Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves.,1
In fact, the day before Mr. Scott died, another father, Terence Crutcher, was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa, Oklahoma.,1
It must end now.,0
And there have been many others.,1
The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.,0
So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary, everyday activities.,1
Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.,0
Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.,0
Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles, listening to music in their car with friends.,1
And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers.,1
Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others.,1
Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.,0
Or the young child walking home from school.,0
From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia, the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well.,1
It's been a hard year, hasn't it?,1
For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.,0
Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy, another shattered family, another distressed community.,1
And our children are watching, and they feel it too.,1
My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.,0
Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.,0
You've seen that right here in Charlotte.,1
I care too much about my country to let that happen.,0
Last Monday at the city council meeting, 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said, 'I wake up every morning scared that I won't get to grow up because I am black.',1
A nine-year-old, Zianna Oliphant, who's here with us today, along with her brother Marquis and her family, also spoke at that city council meeting, with tears pouring down her face.,1
And when I read what she had said, I had tears in my eyes too.,1
We all care too much about our country to let that happen.,0
Good policing saves lives.,0
She said, 'We are black people and we shouldn't have to feel like this.,1
My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.,0
The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.,0
Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.,0
Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?,0
It's a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed, and we can't even see them anymore.,1
It's a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them.,1
We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side.',1
What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world.,1
But can you imagine, nine years old.,1
She should be thinking about happy adventures, dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her.,1
Instead she's talking about graveyards.,1
I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country.,0
Our entire country should take a moment to really look at what's going on here, and across America, to imagine what we see on the news, and what we hear about, imagine through our children's eyes. ,1
It's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.,0
I'm a grandmother, and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren, but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers.,1
They have different, and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face.,1
It makes my heart ache, when kids like Zianna, are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless.,1
I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.,0
Hillary Clinton has had her chance.,0
I know how I would feel.,1
I wouldn't be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now.,1
But because my grandchildren are white, because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state, let's be honest here ... they won't face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council.,1
She failed.,0
You know, every child deserves the same sense of security, every child deserves the same hope.,1
They should not be facing fear, they should be learning and growing, imagining who they can be, and what their contributions to our country could be as well.,1
We've got to take action, we've got to start now, not tomorrow, not next year, now.,1
Now it's time for new leadership.,0
The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.,0
We know we can't solve all these problems over night, which means we don't have a moment to lose.,1
Proverbs tells us, 'Where there is no vision, the people perish.',1
So let's hold on to a common vision.,1
There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.,0
Let's come together to make America a place where every child, no matter who they are, where they're born or what they look like, has the chance to live up to their God-given potential.,1
It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American ... and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time.,0
I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.,0
It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.,0
Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other.,1
The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.,0
We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists, not just in police departments but throughout our country, without vilifying police officers.,1
Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.,0
Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.,0
We can call for reforms to policing, while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity.,1
Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.,0
I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson.,1
18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.,0
You might not have heard of him, but I want you to.,1
The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.,0
Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.,0
Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.,0
He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge.,1
A few days before he died, he wrote on Facebook, he was black but he wore blue.,1
55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil.,0
'In uniform,' he wrote, 'I get nasty, hateful looks.,1
There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country.,0
Out of uniform, some consider me a threat.,1
These are trying times.,1
Please don't let hate infect your heart.',1
1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.,0
And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug, 'I got you.',1
Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas.,1
To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.,0
The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.,0
And most officers will tell you they can't do one without the other.,1
They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it.,0
It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America ... and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.,0
I'm not part of the corrupt system.,0
In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.,0
I've been paying my own way.,0
I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system, not half measures but full measures, with real follow-through.,1
In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law.,1
The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.,0
That starts with being honest.,1
Being unafraid to face the facts.,1
The other party ... the Democratic Party ... nominated the personification of special interest corruption.,0
Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped, searched by police, charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing.,1
The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.,0
We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses.,1
I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.,0
We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations.,1
The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.,0
We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline, and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education.,1
And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.,1
Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men, more than the next nine causes combined.,1
We've got to make sure there are good jobs, equality affordable housing in every zip code in America.,1
We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind.,1
I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburn's plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more.,1
Jobs.,0
Safety.,0
Opportunity.,0
Fair and equal representation.,0
We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.,0
Now, there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division.,1
Who want to exploit people's fears, even though it means tearing our nation even further apart.,1
They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more 'law and order.',1
As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesn't exist.,1
Now, of course we need safe neighborhoods, no one is against that.,1
She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.,0
The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.,0
Of course, we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence, of course we need that.,1
It's time to break with the failures of the past ...,0
I want to offer Americans a new future.,0
But we also need justice and dignity and equality, and we can have both.,1
It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.,0
This is not an either-or question for America.,1
Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.,0
The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.,0
I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision.,1
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.,0
That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done.,1
Insiders fighting for insiders.,0
And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election.,1
I am fighting for you.,0
This is much bigger than an election.,1
When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?,0
It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.,0
It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.,0
These are issues I've been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.,0
The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.,0
Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.,0
Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers, 13, 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders.,1
Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.,0
I care deeply about this because it's not just personal to so many of us, it's about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren.,1
I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright, energetic, impressive young woman like Zianna.,1
Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.,0
I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.,0
Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.,0
Come up here a minute, would you?,1
I love your dress.,1
I am fighting ... all of us across the country are fighting ... for peaceful regime change in our own country.,0
The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.,0
You know, God loves us all, right?,1
The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.,0
I am going to give the people their voice back.,0
We are called to care for and cherish each other.,1
It's not easy, it is not.,1
But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do, not only as Christians but as Americans, as human beings to understand and respect each other.,1
To fight for each other's children, each other's dignity, each other's opportunity as if they were our own.,1
Think about it.,0
Now, make no mistake, this is not easy work.,1
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.,0
You've been doing this since Adam and Eve came here.,1
But it is righteous work.,1
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another.,0
Protecting all of God's children is America's calling.,1
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.,0
Remember what scripture also tells us: 'Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.',1
We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart.,1
We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of God's people.,1
Thank you.",1
Now, I'm pretty excited about being here today.,1
Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?,0
And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James.,1
Aren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?,0
Now, I may become president, but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king.,1
I'm obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability.,1
Are you ready for change?,0
Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first?,0
But I'll tell you what really moved me the most is he's given back to his hometown.,1
He has advocated for small businesses, for kids, giving kids more opportunities.,1
That puts your country first?,0
He's spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform.,1
He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice.,1
So I am truly honored to have his support, and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball, but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways.,1
That puts your family first?,0
Let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.,0
Now, we do have an important election coming up.,1
It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.,0
I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system ... a lot of people who've created our problems ... will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.,0
Who here is planning to vote?,1
It's time to stop making the special interests rich.,0
Well, that is very good news because this is the most consequential election, I think, in our lifetimes.,1
The choice could not be clearer, and we need everybody to show up.,1
And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote?,1
It's time to make the American people rich.,0
I am going to Make America Wealthy again.,0
The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.,0
They've ruined the schools.,0
They've driven out the jobs.,0
They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.,0
Violent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year.,0
Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.,0
Everybody here registered?,1
Well, I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th.,1
That's just a little over a week away.,1
Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.,0
And if you're not sure whether or not someone you know is registered, or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive, you can go to iwillvote.com ... see that sign over there?,1
This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton.,0
You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to.,1
More poverty, more crime, and more of the same.,0
So let's get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left.,1
Thirty-six days, now, we are reaching out.,1
The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.,0
It is time for a different future.,0
We're making phone calls.,1
We're knocking on doors.,1
If you want to get involved, you can go to my website, hillaryclinton.com.,1
Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days.,1
You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, at 47246, and get involved, because we are running to win Ohio in this election.,1
Here is what I am proposing.,0
And everybody, everybody in the campaign, is crisscrossing Ohio.,1
First, on immigration.,0
No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community.,0
Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.,0
My daughter's been here a bunch.,1
Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here.,1
I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community.,0
My husband's coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio.,1
And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state. ,1
We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.,0
Now, I'm going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago, fighting for kids and families, standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life, making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream.,1
On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job.,0
See, I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
If you're willing to work for it and do your part, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America. ,1
Now, my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead, and that may be because we have very different life experiences.,1
On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores ... and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.,0
And that's okay.,1
People have different families, different views of the world.,1
But here's what I have noticed.,1
I have noticed that he always puts himself first.,1
I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.,0
Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas.,0
I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.,0
And maybe that's because he was born into a millionaire family.,1
On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers.,0
We are going to put students and parents first.,0
Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.,0
I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.,0
On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.,0
To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.,0
On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare ... which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases ... and give choice to patients and consumers.,0
He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father.,1
His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him.,1
And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code, of our economy, that he could.,1
Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out ... as are many of the major insurance companies.,0
And along the way, along the way, he has stiffed people ... small businesses and workers and contractors.,1
And that's part of the reason I take this election so seriously.,1
My dad was a small businessman.,1
On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.,0
We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.,0
My grandfather was a factory worker.,1
And so my dad, when he got out of the Navy in World War II, he started a small business.,1
We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government.,0
He started a printing business.,1
In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.,0
No one will be above the law.,0
I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.,0
I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.,0
This is all just the beginning.,0
We are going to make this a government of the people once again.,0
He printed fabrics for draperies.,1
And he worked really hard.,1
He had a print plant in Chicago ... no natural light, no windows, just a long room where there were two big, long tables, and the fabric would be laid out on them.,1
And then if you've ever seen silkscreens, that's what he did.,1
You take the silkscreen.,1
This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you.,0
The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.,0
These are tough times.,0
You put it down.,1
You pour the paint in.,1
You take the squeegee.,1
You go across.,1
But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.,0
You lift it up.,1
To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.,0
I will be your fighter.,0
To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.,0
You go down to the end of one long table, you start on the end of the other long table.,1
Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina.,0
She cannot win for you.,0
And then, if it was going to be two colors, you would add another color, doing exactly the same thing.,1
Most importantly, she has bad judgment.,0
It was before there was machines.,1
My dad couldn't have afforded that anyway.,1
But he worked really hard, and he produced a good middle class life for our family.,1
And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people, I got to tell you, I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him, because I have met people he stiffed.,1
I have met people.,1
Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.,0
I'm talking painters and plumbers.,1
The only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors ... not the people.,0
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.,0
I'm talking dishwashers, marble installers, glass installers, architects, a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos.,1
He wouldn't pay them.,1
Now, you got to stop and ask yourself, what kind of person does that?,1
Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored.,1
And so I met one of the men.,1
I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no.,1
My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge.,0
we're not going to pay it.,1
And the man was stunned, as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been.,1
And then they come back, the Trump organization or Trump himself, and say, okay, we'll give you 10 cents, 20 cents, maybe 30 cents on the dollar.,1
Her pledge reads: "I'm With Her",0
I choose to recite a different pledge.,0
Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that.,1
They had bought the material, They had provided the services.,1
My pledge reads: "I'm With You ... the American people.",0
I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.,0
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity ... a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.,0
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.,0
We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.,0
Trump didn't care.,1
He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide.,1
I got to tell you, that is not the way we're supposed to do business in America.,1
To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.,0
And I can't imagine having a president who believes that that's the way you're supposed to treat people.,1
But you're going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House.,1
Together, We will make America strong again.,0
We will make American safe again.,0
Now, earlier today, earlier today in Toledo, I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of.,1
Now, the most recent example is Wells Fargo.,1
And we will make America great again.,0
Wells Fargo actually had people, thousands of their employees, putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand.,1
And then every time they put somebody into a new account, they got fees, which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus ... a really crummy game that hurt people.,1
Thank you, and God Bless.,0
So thankfully, we have an organization now, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington, who looks out for people who get [...].,1
Colorado is home to six military bases.,0
We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military.,0
That is an important part of how we're going to protect.,1
Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing.,0
We are going to conserve your land for future generations, and we are going to save the 2nd amendment.,0
And it's run, you may know, by Richard Cordray from Ohio.,1
Now, will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency?,1
Well, we're not going to let that happen.,1
One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy.,0
That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers who've been taken advantage of by corporations.,1
And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008.,1
Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines, and shut down shale, oil, and natural gas.,0
I have said we're never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again, and I mean it.,1
We are going to end the war on American energy, and we are going to put the miners back to work.,0
Contrast that ... contrast that with my opponent.,1
I have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan ...and the largest regulatory reform in American history.,0
That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are.,0
A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code, an issue of concern to all Americans.,0
Along with securing our borders, rebuilding our military, keeping us safe from terrorism, redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs, fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons I'm running for President.,0
I've been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous, complex and yes, unfair, our tax system is.,0
This is not the fault of the IRS, but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists.,0
He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street.,1
It is these politicians who wrote the tax code, and who are constantly adding, revising, and changing, an already over-complicated set of laws ... all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests.,0
It's thousands of pages long, and almost no one understands it.,0
He basically wants to let Wall Street, the banks, the hedge funds, all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again.,1
The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it.,0
Many so-called experts, due to the sheer size and complexity of the code, don't have a clue what these pages represent.,0
The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable, it's something I've been talking about for a long time ... despite being a beneficiary.,0
I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone, which is why I am the one who can fix them ... and that is what I commit to doing.,0
As a businessman and real estate developer, I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit, and to the benefit of my company and my employees.,0
I have often said on the campaign trail, that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required ... or, put another way, to pay as little tax as legally possible.,0
As a major real estate developer in this country, and throughout the world, I face enormous taxes: city taxes, state taxes, sales and excise taxes, employee taxes, and federal taxes.,0
Well, I'll tell you what, we're not going to let that happen.,1
We need more rules, not fewer rules on them. ,1
I want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy.,1
But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore.,1
That is not working for us.,1
But Trump's whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics.,1
It's the same ... the same idea that has failed us before.,1
It's my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible ... which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods, workers, and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities ... and always help our great providers of jobs, the small business.,0
The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990's, at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our country's history.,0
You see, he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down.,1
Well, we know that doesn't work.,1
The conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008.,0
We've been down that road.,1
And what he wants to do is, I think it's fair to say, trickle-down on steroids.,1
What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically ... and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures, the collapse of the Savings &amp; Loan industry, and the implosion of the retail market, and real estate in general.,0
Many business people, including many of my competitors, were not able to survive.,0
Companies, jobs, and opportunities were lost ... and lives were destroyed, as tens of thousands of people were put out of work.,0
What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy.,1
Now, I'm a little confused about this because for a long time we've been saying, 'Hey, where are your tax returns?',1
Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt.,0
Yet today, my company is bigger, stronger, with far greater assets, and more premium properties, than ever before.,0
A lot of us wondered what he was hiding.,1
That did not happen by chance or luck ... it happened by action, and talent.,0
I was able to use the tax laws of this country, and my business acumen, to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did.,0
Because you know, if it was something that would make him look good, he would put them right out there.,1
Everybody who's ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns.,1
In those most difficult times, when so many had their backs to the wall, I reached within myself and delivered for my company, my employees, my family and the communities where my properties existed.,0
My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there.,1
Those who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work, and who know virtually nothing of business, fail to understand the skill, dedication, and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties.,0
You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes, and frankly, we were grateful we could.,1
We are grateful for the blessings that we've had over the last 15 years. ,1
People like my opponent Hillary Clinton, whose only method of making money is by selling ,0
So did any of you see the debate last Monday?,1
Well, I raised it.,1
government favors and granting access to special interests, know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow.,0
I said, 'Well, maybe he doesn't want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders, or maybe he hasn't paid any taxes.',1
Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life ... or added a single dollar of value to the American economy.,0
Now, shortly after the debate, it was discovered that, indeed, back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos.,1
Hillary Clinton hasn't made an honest dollar in her entire life ... all she does is take from you, from our country, and peddles influence to donors, special interests, and foreign actors ... for astronomical dollars and like never before.,0
Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos?,1
It's corruption of the highest order.,0
While I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law, Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale.,0
By her own account, Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke, and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars ... without building a company, or creating a single thing of value. ,0
During the early nineties, as companies were collapsing left and right, the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back.,0
They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing, and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees, and no pathway out.,0
But, I never had any doubts and never gave up.,0
That's because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best.,0
Really.,1
And yesterday some of his supporters said, 'Well, it just shows he's a genius that he didn't pay any taxes.',1
And when people make the mistake of underestimating me, that's when they are in for their biggest surprise.,0
Well, what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place? ,1
In the debate, he said not paying taxes made him smart.,1
Just look at what happened in the primary.,0
Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now.,0
The reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn, was that I knew myself, I knew my business, I knew the financial system, I knew the tax code and, most importantly, I knew how to fight.,0
But think about what that means.,1
That's what I am ... a fighter, and I am now going to fight for you.,0
It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes, right ... what's he saying about us?,1
With my knowledge, I knew that I would make a comeback in business.,0
But more than that, zero taxes means zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college, zero for health, zero for education.,1
That is why I am here today.,0
That is why I have left private business for public life ... because I ,0
understand our country is in very bad shape.,0
And now our country is in need of a major comeback ... it needs one now more than ever.,0
And you stop and ask yourself, this is the same person who's been going around really just dumping on America.,1
We owe $20 trillion dollars in debt, but that's only part of the story ... we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities, and we have a budget that's out of control with annual deficits.,0
In addition, because of the incompetence of our leaders, we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis, now almost $800 billion a year.,0
He says our military's a disaster.,1
Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us.,1
Today in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes.,1
Our country is broke.,0
We have decaying infrastructure, failing schools, rising crime, a depleted military, an open border, and an economy that can't create full-time high-paying jobs.,0
We are a divided nation, and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided, with race riots in our streets on a ,0
monthly basis.,0
This is not the America that was handed down to us, and it's not the America we want for our children.,0
Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy ... the poster boy ... for the same rigged system that he would make even worse.,1
And it's certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren.,0
But this is the America we will have if we don't turn things around ... starting today.,0
What I say is not lost on the American people, because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction.,0
We cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton will be worse.,0
We can turn this all around ... but not if we don't make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW.,0
The failed political establishment must go ... it must go for the sake of your country, your future, and those you love the most.,0
In the early 90's, they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished.,0
Just think about it.,1
Everybody said that I was done ... there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.,0
He paid zero at least for about 20 years, we believe now based on what we know.,1
They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories.,0
And he's advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more.,1
So they said I was finished.,0
The only person who didn't think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump.,0
I started my company with a small loan and, as I grew, I borrowed money to grow the company.,0
What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money?,1
Really?,1
When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market, I had all the debt, it stayed the same ... but the value of the assets plummeted.,0
There's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye.,1
But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not.,0
My understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didn't have a clue, including many of my competitors who lost everything they had, never to be heard from again.,0
Now, they're gone, and I'm here and I'm ready to turn things around for this country.,0
The early 90's was a very tough time for the world, but in tough times you need tough people.,0
So we know he's stiffed people, didn't pay his bills.,1
We know he took bankruptcy, depending on how you count, four or six times.,1
You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years.,1
We don't know what his taxes would be after that.,1
These are tough times for America today, and we need tough leaders.,0
He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009.,1
Not people who tell you what you want to hear, but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians, like the Clintons, ever back into the White House again.,0
These tough times were when I performed my very best.,0
Show the American people your taxes.,1
I'll tell you another thing.,1
The economy and banks collapsing, the government was a mess ... but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle.,0
If I'm fortunate enough to be president, we're going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes.,1
So what did we find out today?,1
I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win.,0
That's the thinking we need for our country ... that's the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals, and military deals, and economic deals on behalf of the American people.,0
Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects.,1
Put me into the boardroom as YOUR representative, and I will deliver for you.,0
So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us.,1
He sent that money overseas.,1
Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors.,0
I am here fighting for America.,0
Many people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone they've ever seen ...,0
I've proven that over and over again.,0
Now, he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese, right?,1
You hear that all the time when he talks.,1
That's what I do.,0
When the pressure is on, when the odds are stacked against me, when people say it can't be done ... that's when I am just getting started.,0
Well, it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese.,1
It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese.,1
The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible.,0
So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show, where he is saying one thing and doing something else.,1
Now, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets.,1
You know that, right?,1
For me, impossible is just a starting point.,0
And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum.,1
How can he make America great again when he won't even buy American products in our country? ,1
And I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented.,1
From the depths of that terrible real estate depression, I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs.,0
Our company, and our employees, remade skylines, revitalized neighborhoods, rejuvenated communities, and hired thousands of workers.,0
On November 8th, America's comeback begins ... and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before.,0
The people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country.,0
This is a city with a rich immigrant history, and a rich Latino history, that has contributed so much to this country and this state.,0
And as Secretary of State, I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese.,1
Though the people of Pueblo, and their families, have hailed from all regions of the world, you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans.,0
I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum.,1
And, as Americans, you are entitled to the same protections as every other American.,0
And today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler ... about 700 more jobs, right?,1
Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities, a great education, and access to high-paying jobs.,0
I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job ... more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here ... Donald Trump said he didn't care.,1
This is the change I will deliver.,0
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure.,0
Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas, and poverty at home.,0
Save it, don't save it; didn't matter to him.,1
Well, I'll tell you where I stood.,1
She's brought massive poverty for everyone, but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens.,0
She opposes school choice, and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools.,0
We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.,0
Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare, and wants to expand it ... Obamacare is an absolute disaster.,0
Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent ... the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump.,0
Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals, like Bill Clinton's NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization ... and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal she calls the "Gold Standard.",0
Colorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals.,0
I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry.,1
And look what we got.,1
Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time.,1
But while you've lost out, Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors.,0
And so we've got to keep building it.,1
We've got to keep making sure that there are good jobs.,1
And we've got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides.,1
So now, I know that Ohio is a tough, tough state.,1
She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests.,0
You've got to get out there.,1
They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks, including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.,0
The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State.,0
To hide her corruption, Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.,0
Then she deleted and bleached 33,000 emails ... after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public.,0
You've got to talk to people, answer questions, make your case.,1
That's what we've been doing.,1
That's what we're going to do all the way to the end of this election.,1
She lies to Congress, under oath, and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals.,0
But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump.,1
I know you know people.,1
I know you do.,1
It's worse than Watergate.,0
The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.,0
And you've got to stage an intervention.,1
We have become a Banana Republic.,0
You've got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done, and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio.,1
In fact, if you look at his tax proposals, they benefit him and other wealthy people ... hedge fund managers and the like, and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families. ,1
Now, today, we learned, that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY ,0
Now, that's the kind of contrast we're getting out in the campaign, but that's why we need your help ... to make sure you go out and talk to everybody.,1
And I know people want change.,1
That's part of the American dynamic spirit.,1
We want change.,1
their laptops.,0
Well, I'll tell you, one thing that is certain is we'll have change ... it's just what kind of change.,1
Let me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up.,0
Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it ... by showing up and voting on November 8th.,0
It's whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans, hardworking Americans, middle-class families, or continues to only help those at the top.,1
I want an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
And that's exactly what we're going to fight for, and that is what we're going to get.,1
People have had it with the years, the decades of Clinton Corruption.,0
This is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.,0
I'll tell you, I've been called a lot of things.,1
Right?,1
The Clintons are the sordid past.,0
We are the bright future.,0
I've never been called quitter.,1
Now, another issue I want to address today is immigration.,0
If I tell you I'm going to get up every day and fight for you, that is exactly what I will do.,1
But I know I can't do it ...,1
As I mentioned, Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants.,0
I can't do it alone.,1
It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy.,0
Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America.,1
Illegal immigration, and broken visa programs, take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today.,0
Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime, and massive drugs ... including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado.,0
And then he said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
We are going to build a border wall, and we are going to stop the drugs, gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado.,0
He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship.,1
He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are.,1
He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin.,1
We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression, and we're never going to let that happen again.,1
And so when Trump basically signs up for Putin's wish list, that's bad enough.,1
We are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many.,0
Cases like Kate Steinle, murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant.,0
Or cases like Sarah Root, killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama ... and then released again after the killing.,0
There are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county, and we are going to get them out ... and we are going to get them out quickly.,0
To the cartels, the gangs, the drug dealers, I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.,0
But then, when he's cavalier ... and I'm not talking about basketball ... when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks.,1
He even said he wouldn't care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons.,1
We also have to keep our country safe from terrorism.,0
One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons, to be able to stop proliferation.,1
And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons.,1
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country ... as was the mall shooter in Washington.,0
Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fianc.. visa from Saudi Arabia.,0
Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.,0
Terrorists are infiltrating our country.,0
The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does.,1
Now, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees ,0
I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table.,1
from across the Middle East.,0
I want to keep you and your family safe.,0
And what I learned ... if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program.,1
And we're going to make sure they follow it to the period, the comma, everything in that agreement.,1
I'm going to enforce.,1
And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections.,1
My job is not to represent foreign countries.,0
So I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that ... we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people.,1
My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America ... putting your jobs, your wages, and your security first.,0
If you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S. citizen, I will ensure you have a safe community, rising wages, and secure immigration system.,0
I've been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS, and I have no doubt we will.,1
Immigration Security is National Security.,0
Here are some more things we will do starting in 2017 ...,0
We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
We are going to rebuild America.,0
And Donald says he has a secret plan.,1
That he won't tell us about.,1
Well, there's no secret; he has no plan. ,1
And we've got to do more ... we've got to do more to make sure we protect our country.,1
We need the best intelligence we can get, the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government.,1
We are going to revitalize America.,0
And we are going to unite America.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
I will not rest.,1
As a former Senator from New York on 9/11, I take this as a personal responsibility.,1
Together, we will make America wealthy again.,0
I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism.,1
We will make America strong again.,0
And finally, my friends, we've got to bring our country back together.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
There is too much divisiveness, too much finger-pointing and scapegoating.,1
Our diversity is one of our strengths.,1
We have to listen to each other.,1
We don't have to agree; that is not required.,1
And we will make America great again.,0
But we need to be respectful.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
Before we get started with our Q &amp; A, I'd like to address one of the most important aspects of America's national security, and that's Cyber Security.,0
We need to listen.,1
And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work.,1
When I was First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, I worked to find common ground with everybody.,1
I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Children's Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids.,1
When I was in the Senate, I worked with practically every Republican I served with.,1
To truly make America safe, we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector.,0
Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States.,0
And they all have nice things to say about me when I'm not running for something.,1
As President, improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration.,0
And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the [...] of that.,1
And we had to get 13 Republicans, and I worked tirelessly and we got them.,1
We did that.,1
There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of.,1
So I'm excited about the campaign, but I'm even more excited about getting to work for you ... being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody.,1
One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses, including all vital infrastructure.,0
I mean, that is how I was raised in my church and by my family, and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice.,1
Cyber-attacks from foreign governments, especially China, Russia, and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups, constitute one of our most critical national security concerns.,0
Hillary Clinton's only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law, engineering a massive cover-up, and putting the entire nation in harm's way.,0
The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter "C" means is just one more example of why she's unfit to hold public office.,0
The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous.,0
And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you.,1
And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate, Tim Kaine ... it's right here ... is real simple: I want you to know what we say we're going to do, because I want you to hold me accountable.,1
I don't believe in bait and switch, where I say, oh, we're going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else.,1
Our government, our businesses, our trade secrets, and our citizens' most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks.,0
Just consider some of these recent hacks:,0
JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen.,0
That kind of reminds you of somebody, doesn't it?,1
E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords.,0
No, here's what we're going to try to do.,1
We're going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations.,1
Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers.,0
And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class.,1
Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world, and the costs in our privacy, our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary.,0
Identify theft, financial laundering, as well as ransom ware ... involving the extortion of a hacked institution ... are all becoming increasingly common.,0
That is not going to happen when I am president.,1
Incredibly, hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations.,0
So please join this campaign in the last 36 days.,1
The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government.,0
It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail.,0
Talk to your friends.,1
Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.,1
I am motivated every day because now I'm a grandmother ... two beautiful grandchildren ... and I think about their future, I think about their lives, I think about our country.,1
The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed.,0
I want our country to be the land of opportunity.,1
We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time.,0
We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice, the FBI, the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia, they were able to have great success in prosecuting them, seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society.,0
The place where dreams do come true if you're willing to work for them.,1
As President, I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal, State, and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime.,0
I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense.,0
I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command.,0
As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources, the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks.,0
This is the warfare of the future, America's dominance in this arena must be unquestioned.,0
Not just for my grandchildren, but for every child.,1
Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well.,0
For non-state terror actors, the United States must develop the ability ... no matter how difficult ... to track down and incapacitate those responsible.,0
I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.,1
We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists.,0
And if you will help me win this election, and then help me work to make it come true, we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of.,1
Thank you and God bless you!",1
I want to acknowledge ... we have an overflow crowd in another room, and I know they can hear us, but we're glad they're here.,1
To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government, including our law enforcement agencies, we will put together a team of the best military, civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology.,0
The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first, but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits.,0
I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved.,0
The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies.,0
I want to thank your Congresswoman, Marcy Kaptur, for her leadership and her grit.,1
This will include the various methods of internal monitoring, attack and penetration, investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees, and identity protection for government employees.,0
The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack, and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur.,0
This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials, requiring them to follow best practices.,0
They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them, along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense.,0
I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson.,1
And the mayor told me there's a young man here who just won a boxing championship, Robert Easter.,1
Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law.,0
I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate.,0
Where's Robert Easter?,1
My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice.,0
Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats, and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century.,0
There you are, Robert Easter.,1
In 35 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
Congratulations.,1
I am going to make America Rich again.,0
I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.,0
I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are.,1
My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence, as he prepares for his debate tonight.,0
The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow, versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past.,0
We are change ... she is four more years of Obama.,0
Clinton can't talk about the real problems facing our country because she's the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place.,0
To hide her corruption, she deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena.,0
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.,0
I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction.,1
In fact, she's just made things worse ... she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent.,0
Do we have any other UAW members here?,1
It's a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons.,1
One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign.,1
She failed overseas, unleashing death and destruction.,0
And she failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.,0
I know ...,1
Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit.,0
Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did?,0
She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate.,0
I've gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half.,1
The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did.,0
I know all their names, and I know who they are, but it's not up to me to make them public figures.,0
Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros, who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months, and Warren Buffet who, in 2014, declared losses of $873 million.,0
I'm grateful for each and every one of them.,1
I know how the tax code works better than anyone, and I am going to fix it so it is fair, and just, and works for you and your family.,0
I've made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law.,0
Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office.,0
But I got to say, there's something special about this one.,1
And it's a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me.,1
Now, not everyone knows this.,1
The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.,0
I mean, you all know what an amazing athlete he his ... MVP, winner of championships ... but he's also ... LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children.,1
Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt.,0
And this afternoon I'll be in Akron, where he's done so much for the kids in that community.,1
It's a deep, personal commitment that he has that I share with him.,1
We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.,1
It doubled under President Obama.,0
I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch.,1
Now, one thing I know ...,1
I'll just say it because I know it's for sure ...,1
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.,0
I hope to be elected president, but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King.,1
I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me, and I really appreciated what she said, because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard, look after one another, and yes, pay their taxes, right?,1
The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together, and it matters.,1
We believe honest work deserves honest pay.,1
Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country.,0
Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare ... even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.,0
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.,0
The federal budget is a disaster.,0
We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back.,1
Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.,0
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
We are nation divided, with race riots in the streets.,0
It's personal for me.,1
I'm the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania.,1
He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years.,1
Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs ... or certainly not the jobs they want.,0
He believed he passed it down to my dad, who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do, he'd have a good life and his kids would have an even better life.,1
Overseas, our failed leaders have empowered Iran, unleashed ISIS, and turned Iraq, Libya and Syria into absolute chaos.,0
That is the American dream.,1
Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.,0
America needs a turnaround.,0
America needs a comeback.,0
America needs a change.,0
That is why I am running.,0
That is what we believe in.,1
That's what we've got to keep going generation after generation.,1
First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
The architect of Obamacare, Jonathan Gruber, admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie ... he called it the "stupidity of the American voter.",0
And because of my grandfather's hard work, my dad made it to college.,1
But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people.,0
And then after serving in the Navy during World War II, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.,1
As a young girl, I'd sometimes go to his print plant.,1
Do you remember all the lies?,0
President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.,0
It was a long building, no natural light, no windows, but he had these long tables where he'd roll out the fabric and then I'd watch him work with silkscreens, if you've ever seen that.,1
He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars.,0
Instead, they surged $5,000.,0
He would take the silkscreen, he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, he'd take the squeegee, go across all the way down to the end of one table, then over to the next table, all the way back.,1
Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.,0
And then if there was a second color to be added, he would do that.,1
He has absolutely trashed President Obama's signature legislation.,0
Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party of our country.",0
Bill has a different view.,0
Here is what bill said:,0
He just said it's a "crazy system," where people end up with "premiums doubled and coverage cut in half.",0
He sometimes let me help with the squeegee.,1
That was my favorite part.,1
And I know he worked really hard.,1
He said "it's the craziest thing in the world.",0
He worked really hard.,1
Bill Clinton said:,0
"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half...the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.",0
He believed in hard work.,1
Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work.",0
I couldn't agree more.,0
He passed that on to me.,1
He provided a good middle-class life for us.,1
So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo, Ohio, and America, who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream, which should be big enough for everybody.,1
Which is why, on my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life, as Kenyetta said, when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago.,1
And it will be the mission of my presidency, because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues, the ones that keep you up at night ... like the cost of child care, and college, and prescription drugs, and so much else.,1
This is essential for Arizona.,0
Because of Obamacare, most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year, and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year.,0
There is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump.,0
Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th, and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can.,0
Next, we are going to unleash American energy,0
I just met with energy producers in Colorado, and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States.,0
And that means we've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes.,1
As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs, we are going to lift the restrictions on shale, oil, natural gas, clean coal, and all forms of job-producing American energy.,0
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival,0
That means we've got to have good schools in every zip code.,1
China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money ... the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.,0
That means everybody willing to work ... and I say that very clearly; you've got to be willing to work ... and if you're willing to work, you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead.,1
That is the basic bargain.,1
Now, I don't know about you, but you wouldn't think that the theme of my campaign, 'getting an economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top' would be controversial ... and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time.,1
We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.,0
Now, I will say, most American companies ... most ... are run by honorable, patriotic people who care about their employees and communities.,1
But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else.,1
Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.,0
[Applause.],1
Too much is being made in other countries.,0
When I am President, we will start making things in America again.,0
Companies like Apple, will start making their computers and iPhones in our country.,0
And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers.,1
Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA ... a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road.,1
And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term.,1
Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.,0
And let's be honest, the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States.,1
And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse.,1
It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists.,1
So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction, it's even more important that we have an election about these very issues.,1
Since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal ... 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.,0
Because what I know will happen ... if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field, we will rebuild the middle class, we will make work pay, we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans.,1
Now, I know how hard this, but I think we are on the cusp, if we win this election, to be able to get these things done, right?",1
That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.,0
<i>Audience:</i> "Yeah.",1
<i>Clinton:</i> "That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector.,1
We've got unmatched talent, innovation, entrepreneurial spirit.,1
So when we work together, we can all benefit.,1
Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries.,0
As the factories leave, our money leaves with them.,0
Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.,0
We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.,0
Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.,0
Now, I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders ... but to their workers, to their customers, to their communities, and yes, to our country, to the United States of America.,1
We have been moving off track for decades.,1
And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.,0
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.,0
We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.,0
I don't need to tell you that.,1
You know it, you've lived it, you've seen it.,1
Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States.,0
But it is time to get back on track.,1
Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay ...and new hope.,0
And you can ask anybody who's ever worked for me or worked with me, who's ever served with me, when I tell you I'm going to try to do something, I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you.,1
But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.,0
Security begins at the border.,0
A nation that doesn't control is borders is not a nation.,0
So let's begin by making it clear that for most businesses, America is the most important asset on their balance sheet.,1
This country of ours, this system of ours, the rule of law, the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you.,1
A country that doesn't protect its people isn't a country.,0
And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world, the American middle class.,1
A government that doesn't put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.,0
So when we middle class thrives, the country thrives.,1
Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens.,0
And when it doesn't, we don't, right?,1
And I'm going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable.,1
Standing up for America, investing in America will pay off.,1
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration.,0
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.,0
The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House.,0
Now, we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value.,1
But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else.,1
He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.,0
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.,0
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.,0
So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom, every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers, exploit your employees, pollute our environment, or rip off taxpayers, we will find ways to hold you accountable.,1
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.,0
But on the other side ... on the other side, if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our country's future, we will stand with you.,1
That is the choice.,1
Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.,0
Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better.,1
Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home.,0
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.,0
Now, to understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we've seen of egregious corporate behavior.,1
In California, a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.,0
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.,0
Look at Wells Fargo.,1
Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 ... he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer ... but despite these previous crimes, he had not been deported.,0
A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names.,0
Really shocking, isn't it?,1
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now ... when I am President, we are getting them out, and quickly.,0
One of the nation's biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers, secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent, even their knowledge, misusing personal information, and then sticking customers with hidden fees.,1
On top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year.,0
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher.,0
At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.,0
Just yesterday, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot.,0
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.,0
It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy, we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law.,1
And then in a category by himself, there's Donald Trump.,1
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country ... as was the mall shooter in Washington.,0
Well, you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades.,1
You can look at 40 years of my tax returns.,1
Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers, here on asylum, or the San Bernardino Shooter, here on a fianc.. visa from Saudi Arabia.,0
Or the Orlando shooter, the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.,0
I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.,0
I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties, you have to release your tax returns.,1
Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.,0
Now, a lot of us were wondering, what is he hiding?,1
Hillary is for open borders.,0
It must be really terrible.,1
Well, The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer.,1
Back in the 1990s, Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos.,1
I am not running to be President of the world.,0
Now, how anybody can lose a dollar, let alone a billion dollars, in the casino industry is kind of beyond me.,1
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
It's just hard to figure.,1
But as a result, it doesn't look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades.,1
Now, while millions of American families, including mine and yours, were working hard paying our fair share, it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation.,1
Imagine that.,1
I am for America First.,0
Not fair.,1
Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college.,1
For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.,0
Nothing for veterans.,1
We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe.,0
Nothing for our military.,1
And you know, he has been dissing America in this whole campaign.,1
Right?,1
We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe.,0
The chaos, the violence and the crime will come to an end ... beginning in January of 2017.,0
He talks us down.,1
He makes disparaging comments about our country.,1
We are going to end the government corruption,0
Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.,0
He calls our military a disaster.,1
Well, it's not, but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform.,1
I saw a newspaper article.,1
Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails ... after a congressional subpoena.,0
A gentleman named Steve Crouse, who owns the Glass City Caf.. here in Toledo, summed it up pretty well in this article.,1
He said, 'I would feel guilty if I didn't pay anything.,1
She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals.,0
It's flat-out cheating the government.',1
It's worse than Watergate.,0
Now, my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about.,1
The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged, and it's a shame, and it's one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation.,0
Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims he's going to change.,1
We have become a Banana Republic.,0
The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business.,1
After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money, he didn't lift a finger to help and protect his employees, or all the small businesses and contractors he'd hired, or the people of Atlantic City.,1
They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire.,1
Yesterday, we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.,0
And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies.,1
Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels, and the American people have one chance to stop it ... by sending in your ballots.,0
In other words, Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill.,1
Now, he says that he's the one who can fix things, but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse.,1
We are also going to fix our inner cities,0
Right?,1
45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty.,0
58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.,0
And here's what I really am just stunned by.,1
More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, six years, seventy years or more.,0
I get stunned every day in this campaign.,1
But here's one of the many things that I'm stunned by.,1
He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more.,1
They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.,0
They've horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities.,0
To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose?,0
Vote For Donald Trump.,0
I will fix it.,0
It would be like you're paying zero.,1
You expect us to pay you to stay in business, all the rest of us in America?,1
To everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose?,0
We will have safe communities for EVERYONE.,0
School choice for your children.,0
Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country, not out of our country.,0
He'd open the loopholes even wider.,1
Everyone will be included in the American Dream.,0
And according to a new independent study, he would actually ... listen to this, people, because this is a real shocker ... his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families.,1
And you know the people it would hit the hardest?,1
Are single parents, whose lives and challenges he doesn't care about, certainly doesn't understand.,1
Now, many have likely already spent years paying more than he did, and he now would make that even worse.,1
Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
And what does he say about it?,1
Well, did you all see the debate last Monday?,1
Well, in the debate ... in the debate ... well, then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes.,1
Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius.,1
We are going to rebuild America.,0
We are going to revitalize America.,0
Here's my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?,1
This is Trump to a T. He's taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it.,1
He abuses his power, games the system, puts his own interests ahead of the country's.,1
It's Trump first and everyone else last.,1
And there are lots of principled, law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this.,1
And we are going to unite America.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
Not a single ... not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trump's campaign.,1
Think about it.,1
I've been endorsed by very successful people ... Warren Buffett, Mike Bloomberg, Mark Cuban.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me.,1
He said, 'Look, I've been successful.',1
You're going to remember this day.,0
We're going to make history.,0
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
He actually is a real billionaire.,1
We're going to make history together.,0
And you know what?,1
You're going to look back at this event, and you're going to look back at November 8th, or the day you put in your early ballot, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
He used profit-sharing to help his employees, not bankruptcy to fire people.,1
And when he sold his first company, he shared the profits with his employees, and 300 of them became millionaires.,1
You are going to be proud of your country again, and you are going to be proud of your President again.,0
That's the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country.,1
A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.,0
But here's what we've got to do.,1
Even if Trump is like one of a kind, we've got to reverse the broader trends he represents.,1
It's time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone.,1
You are voting to believe in yourselves.,0
A vote for commonsense government, solutions to problems.,0
And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers, consumers, small businesses, and workers.,1
It's a vote for jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
It's a vote for a government of, by and for the people.,0
All together, we are going to ...,0
Make America wealthy again.,0
We are going to make America strong again.,0
We are going to make America safe again.,0
And we are going to make America great again.,0
We're going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs, in higher wages, and in stronger communities.,1
In 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.,0
How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night?,0
First let's start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system.,1
It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules.,1
A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse.,1
Mike did such an incredible job.,0
And I'll tell you something else.,1
I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates.,0
Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all.,1
Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent.,0
Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates, and all of America saw that I made the right choice.,0
It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country ... on paper, not in reality ... just to take advantage of lower tax rates.,1
And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand. ,1
So here's what we're going to do.,1
We're going to close those loopholes.,1
While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America, his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions.,0
I've got a list of them we're going after.,1
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.,0
We're going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes.,1
In fact, she's just made things worse ... she failed upstate New York, promising to create 200,000 jobs, but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent.,0
She failed overseas, producing only death and destruction ... she unleashed ISIS, destabilized Iraq, Syria and Libya, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons.,0
We're going to pass something called the Buffett rule, which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them.,1
We're going to put in place a new exit tax.,1
If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share, if they try to outsource jobs, they're going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country.,1
And then we're going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America.,1
Second, we're going to protect consumers.,1
At home, Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans, producing only more poverty in the inner cities.,0
No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo.,1
And this isn't a new fight for me.,1
She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry.,0
As a Senator, I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages.,1
I am running to represent Americans ... and we are going to make America Rich again.,0
I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids.,1
I introduced legislation to protect Americans' personal data and combat identity theft.,1
So as president, I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government.,1
And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau, which was created after the financial crisis.,1
I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.,0
My economic agenda is very simple: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.,0
Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt.,0
And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren.,1
And under the leadership of Ohio's Rich Cordray, the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders, credit card companies, and others.,1
It doubled under President Obama.,0
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.,0
And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back.,1
Now, I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done.,1
Sometimes people say, well, what does the government really do?,1
The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
Our police are under-funded, under-staffed, and under-supported ... and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist.,0
Our border is wide open, and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country.,0
Well, there's a lot of examples, but this is a primary one, standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off.,1
And because of its success, Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down.,1
And Donald Trump agrees with them.,1
Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare ... even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.,0
In fact, he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis.,1
Well, not on my watch, Donald.,1
We're never going to let that happen.,1
Now, instead of gutting consumer protection, we should be expanding it.,1
And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never, ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again.,1
And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address.,1
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.,0
When the scam's victims, people like you and me, who had accounts there tried to sue, they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated.,1
Instead, they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law.,1
We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print "gotchas" to escape accountability. ,1
The federal budget is a disaster.,0
Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.,0
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
We are a nation divided, with race riots in the streets.,0
Our college students graduate, loaded with debt, only to discover they can't find jobs ... or certainly not the jobs they want.,0
Our allies aren't paying their fair share, foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us, and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.,0
And in fact, this is now common practice across a lot of industries ... from nursing homes, nursing homes that mistreat seniors, to for-profit colleges that defraud students.,1
Who reads all that fine print?,1
I don't.,1
America needs a turnaround.,0
And you get defrauded or you get mistreated, and then all of a sudden they say, 'Well, you can't sue us.',1
So we're going to rein in that abuse across everybody.,1
America needs a comeback.,0
We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,1
America needs a change.,0
It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else.,1
That is why I am running.,0
It's one of the reasons I'm against it.,1
On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is back ... bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.,0
First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.,0
I've warned about this for years, I've written about it, and I oppose TPP now, I will oppose it after the election, I will oppose it as president ... because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers.,1
That was a lie.,0
He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars.,0
Instead, they surged $5,000.,0
And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason?,1
We're going to have to protect ourselves against that too.,1
And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding, life-saving drugs, we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs.,1
And let's finally import safe alternatives from other countries, like Canada, and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market.,1
And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients.,1
Another lie.,0
Now, of all people, President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.,0
Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation.,0
Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.",0
Bill has a different view.,0
Here is what bill said:,0
He just said it's a "crazy system," and that "it's the craziest thing in the world.",0
And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine.,1
No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions. ,1
So let's stand up for taxpayers.,1
Let's stand up for consumers.,1
Bill said:,0
And let's stand up for small businesses, which create most of the jobs in America.,1
"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half...the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.",0
Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work.",0
I take this personally be-cause of my dad's very small business.,1
On my first day in office, I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump.,0
The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th.,0
The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th.,0
We need fair rules of the road so big corporations can't use their power to gain unfair advantages.,1
And early voting begins on the 22nd.,0
Now, when it comes to bullying small businesses, Donald Trump is the poster boy.,1
I have heard so many stories of contractors, and I've met some too, who worked for him, produced the goods and services, and never got paid for what they were owed.,1
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival,0
China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money ... the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.,0
I'm talking about painters, and plumbers, piano sellers, architects, glass installers ... he stiffed them all.,1
We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.,0
Not because he couldn't pay them, but he wouldn't pay them.,1
And he told them, 'You want to get your money?,1
Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.,0
Too much is being made in other countries.,0
When I am President, we will start making things in America again.,0
Sue me.',1
Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA ... a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
My dad could never have done that.,1
Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.,0
I'm just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump, because I don't know what we would have done.,1
Since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal ... 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.,0
That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.,0
More than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays.,1
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
That can cause a serious cash flow crisis.,1
As the factories leave, our money leaves with them.,0
Stores close, schools suffer, the tax base erodes, wages fall and the quality of life declines.,0
So as president, I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field.,1
Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973.,0
Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy.,1
We've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.,0
Sometimes it's called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies, but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes, as well as consumers.,1
Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.,0
With less competition, corporations can use their power to raise prices, limit choice for consumers, cut wages for workers, crowd out startups and small businesses.,1
Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.,0
I mean, look what's happening right now.,1
And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.,0
In most of the country, the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market.,1
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.,0
We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation, and apply tariffs to countries that cheat.,0
No wonder premiums are going up.,1
We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the deal Hillary called the "Gold Standard.",0
The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, and their wish is her command.,0
As president, I will appoint tough, independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions, so the big don't keep getting bigger and bigger.,1
She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.,0
I am an outsider fighting for YOU.,0
I want every business to compete and thrive, and then I also want to do something else.,1
Let's protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy.,1
We will stop the foreign cheating, the product dumping, and the one-sided trade deals.,0
Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards, not just senior executives.,1
We will lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent.,0
On top of that, we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.,0
So we're proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits, on top of, not instead of, higher wages.,1
Our tax, trade, energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade.,0
We need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining.,1
America will become the great jobs magnet of the world.,0
And we have to resist the assault on workers' rights.,1
Factories will come rushing in, our schools and communities will be revitalized, and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay ...and new hope.,0
But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.,0
Let's say loudly and clearly: 'right to work' is wrong for workers and wrong for America.,1
Security begins at the border.,0
Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead.,0
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton.,0
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root.,0
Let's also, my friends, let's raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you don't live in poverty.,1
The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton.,0
Let's defend overtime and go after wage theft.,1
Let's provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable, high-quality childcare.,1
And of course you know what I'm going to say: let's finally guarantee equal pay for women.,1
He was released again after the crime, and is now at large.,0
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before.,0
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona.,0
Now, my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say I'm playing the woman's card.,1
And I'll tell you ... right?,1
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody.,0
Another victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times.,0
Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home.,0
... if fighting for working families is playing the women's card, you know what?,1
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal.,0
In California, a 64-years old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer.,0
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported.,0
Also in California, my good friend, Jamiel Shaw, lost his amazing son at the age of 17 ... he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant.,0
The killer had 3 gun charges, as well as battery of a police officer, prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country.,0
Deal me in!,1
And then finally, I've got a lot on my mind, but finally, we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home.,1
As president, I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers.,1
We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II.,1
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now, and more who have escaped the law entirely ... when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.,0
I want to direct $10 billion to create a 'Make It in America' partnership to support American manufacturing.,1
All Americans living lawfully in this country, including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants, are entitled to have their jobs, their wages, and their security protected.,0
The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today ... and when those borders are erased, it's often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security.,0
At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.,0
And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody.,1
Just two days ago, an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot.,0
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.,0
That includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas, from inner cities to rural communities ravaged ... ravaged ... by hollowed-out factories, ravaged by mines that have been shut down, ravaged by opiate addiction.,1
It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top, I mean it.,1
And we're going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets, not costs.,1
And we're going to bring back infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, clean, renewable energy jobs, innovation, technology, small business. ,1
Now, you don't have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio.,1
Just a few years ago, as you heard Kenyetta say, in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm.,1
Jobs, homes, savings, wiped out.,1
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country ... as was the mall shooter in Washington State.,0
Now, the media doesn't want to talk about this ... they don't want to ask how our vetting procedures failed, or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence.,0
The Boston Bombers were here on asylum.,0
The auto industry on the verge of collapse.,1
The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fianc.. visa from Saudi Arabia.,0
A lot of people were ready to give up on it.,1
The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.,0
I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country.,0
Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.,0
Hillary is for open borders.,0
I am not running to be President of the world.,0
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
I am for America First.,0
For the first time in American history, we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers.,0
Well, that would have meant giving up on 850,000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry.,1
Donald Trump, for one, said rescuing the auto industry didn't matter very much.,1
We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep our people safe.,0
I have a simple message for the cartels, the gang members, and the drug dealers preying on our citizens ... your days are numbered, and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end.,0
Either way would have been acceptable, he said.,1
We are also going to end the government corruption,0
Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.,0
Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails ... after a congressional subpoena.,0
'We could have just let it go,' and that's a direct quote from him.,1
Everybody in Ohio who's thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that.,1
She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.,0
At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009, he would have let you twist and fall.,1
And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence, an ardent opponent of the auto rescue.,1
Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.,0
Well, thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio weren't ready to let it go.,1
You never gave up.,1
You didn't lose faith.,1
Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots.,0
And now, after a lot of hard work and sacrifice, the auto industry just had its best year ever.,1
But that's not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work, America, America, came to the rescue.,1
Taxpayers like all of us, not him but us, provided the funds for the rescue.,1
Union workers stepped up.,1
We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans,0
Communities like Toledo came together to make it work.,1
And now that the industry's back on its feet, the auto companies have a responsibility to give back. ,1
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.,0
So I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo, investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler, which could create about 700 new good jobs.,1
58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.,0
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more.,0
And tens of thousands of UAW workers at Chrysler plants should see a big increase in profit-sharing payments above and beyond wages and benefits.,1
They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.,0
To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose?,0
Now, that's the way it's supposed to work, when we all help each other out.,1
Vote For Donald Trump.,0
When we stand together, we are stronger together.,1
I will fix it.,0
So what I want you to know is if you join me in this campaign, I will always stand up and fight for you and fight for your jobs and fight for your families.,1
And I guess we have about 36 days left.,1
The election's going to be close.,1
Every call you make, every door you knock, every friend you register to vote, could make the difference.,1
You can text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com to sign up and volunteer.,1
Here in Ohio you have until October the 11th to register to vote.,1
And there are people with clipboards around, and you can go actually register today on your way out the door.,1
I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and to help their children grow up in safety and peace.,0
Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses, and new high-paying jobs.,0
So we have just over a week to register, and then early voting starts October 12th.,1
Let's prove ... let's prove ... that the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise.,1
I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.,0
I want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education, and a high-paying job.,0
Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
Let's prove that we're going to stand together, make the smart decisions that we get the economy going and growing for everybody, not just those at the top; that we will stand up against special privilege and special interest; that we will be ready after this election to have an agenda that will really make a difference here in Toledo and across Ohio.,1
So I'm here asking for your help, asking for your work, asking for you to be part of this campaign, and then when we win on November 8, be part of changing our country for the better!,1
Thank you all and God bless you!",1
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.,0
Any of you see that debate last night?,1
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.,0
I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land, and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
I'll tell you what, I'm not sure you'll ever see anything like that again.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
At least I hope you won't.,1
It was such a clear display of what's at stake in this election.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together, because I truly believe we are stronger together.,1
To move our country forward.,1
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
We're going to make history together.,0
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
Now, the one thing I thought about last night and said was, as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent, was to remember what Michelle Obama had said.,1
A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.,0
You are voting to believe in yourselves.,0
To paraphrase her, one of us went low and one of us went high.,1
I want you to understand, I want to be a president for all Americans.,1
You are voting to believe in your country.,0
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
All together, we are going to ...,0
And I am honored to have support, not just from Democrats, but from independents and Republicans, because we've got to pull this country together if we're going to move into the future together, creating what we need for ourselves and our children.,1
Make America wealthy again.,0
We are going to make America strong again.,0
We are going to make America safe again.,0
Now, I got to tell you, tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow, October 11th, is the last day to register in Ohio.,1
And we are going to make America great again.,0
With your help, in 34 days, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back our jobs.,0
And I hope every one of you will take your phones out, go to iwillvote.com, to confirm that you are registered.,1
Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody else's.,1
When I think about the challenges that we're facing, I don't think any one person has all the answers.,1
I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity, because that makes us smarter as well as stronger.,1
Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing.,1
We are going to make America rich again.,0
I am going to end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, keep jobs from pouring out of our country, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses.,0
We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women.,1
And last night he doubled down on his excuse, saying that, well, it's just locker room banter.,1
You know what's happened today, which is so interesting, is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA, from Major League Baseball, from the NFL and more, have been coming forward, tweeting, they've been saying, no, that's not what happens in our locker rooms.,1
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.,0
In fact, she's just made things worse ... it's been 30 years of failure.,0
The problems we face as a country are immense, and it is going to take bold action to turn things around.,0
And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does.,1
Right now, we owe $20 trillion in debt.,0
It doubled under President Obama.,0
But it wasn't just this one video that was so disturbing, even shocking.,1
We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign, and it's not just about women.,1
Yes, he's insulted and demeaned women; we've seen it over and over again.,1
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.,0
But he has targeted others as well.,1
He's disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos, Muslims and POWs, people with disabilities and immigrants.,1
He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one.,1
That is not what we are in America.,1
And it may be who he is, but this election is our chance to show who we are.,1
We are better than that.,1
We are bigger than that.,1
The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
And I want to send a message to every boy and girl, every man and woman in our country, indeed, to the entire world, that that is not who America is.,1
Heroin overdoses are surging, and meth overdoses in Nevada are up 22 percent.,0
And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever.,1
Thousands of refugees are being admitted, with no way to screen them, and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare ... even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need.,0
Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than we've had in a really long time.,1
And the main reason is because your generation, the young people of America, are the most tolerant, open and generous generation in American history. ,1
You know what's at stake, but you also know what you believe.,1
And you don't want someone who says that he's going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will ... who will keep Citizens United, one of the worst decisions ever made, that allowed dark, unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a woman's right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood.,1
You know better than that.,1
You are helping us move toward a more perfect union.,1
That has been the story of America at our best.,1
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year.,0
The federal budget is a disaster.,0
We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in.,1
Our State Department, mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton, misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds.,0
If you're willing to do your part, you're willing to make your contribution, there is a place for you in this nation of ours.,1
We don't have to make America great.,1
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
On top of it all, our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities can't provide the most basic services.,0
We've got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity.,1
And please, never forget America is great because America is good, and if we deviate, if we deviate from our fundamental values ... and that's indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run.,1
He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes.,1
America needs a turnaround.,0
America needs a comeback.,0
America needs a change.,0
He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country ... a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty.,1
And that change is coming on November 8th.,0
We are going to show the whole world that America is back ... bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before.,0
This is turning the clock back, not just a few years, but centuries.,1
First, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
The only way to rebuke this is to vote.,1
President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare.,0
Two days ago, Bill Clinton torched President Obama's signature legislation.,0
Remember, Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama, of the Democratic Party, and of our country.",0
Use the single most important, fundamental right you have as citizens of America.,1
Bill has a different view.,0
Here is what bill said:,0
He just said it's a "crazy system," and that "it's the craziest thing in the world.",0
And when you do, I want you to know what you're voting for, because I don't want you just to vote against something.,1
I want you to vote for something.,1
And here's what we're going to do.,1
Bill said:,0
"people out there [are] busting it, sometimes 60 hours a week, [and] wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half...the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies.",0
Clinton added that it "doesn't make any sense," and that "the insurance model doesn't work.",0
There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump.,0
I believe our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th.,0
The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th.,0
And early voting begins on the 22nd.,0
With your votes, you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada.,0
As soon as I got out of law school, I said, I don't want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families.,1
So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change, helping to get the law that enabled people, kids with disabilities, to go to school.,1
Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment, by overturning D.C. vs. Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right.,0
Now, most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you weren't born, but ... there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability, if you lived in a school district, there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you.,1
We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters, anglers, and all who enjoy the outdoors.,0
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival,0
And literally millions of kids were denied an education.,1
I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say, this is wrong ... in America, we're better than this.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
But to bring back our jobs, we must fix our trade deals ... and stand up to countries that cheat.,0
Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities.,1
And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place. ,1
China, Japan, and Europe are printing huge sums of money ... the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country, our businesses, and our citizens.,0
So when Donald Trump talks about what I've been doing for the last 30 years, I welcome that.,1
We're not on a level playing field, and our politicians don't understand what is going on.,0
I welcome it because in the 1970s, I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments.,1
Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers, and we are not making things in America anymore.,0
Too much is being made in other countries.,0
When I am President, we will start making things in America again.,0
And in the 1980s, I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future, while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business.,1
Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton's NAFTA ... a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
And in the 1990s, I went to the UN Conference on Women and said women's rights are human rights ... while he was insulting Miss Universe, Alicia Machado.,1
And on the day ... on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice.,1
So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years, bring it on. ,1
Hillary's Korea deal also cost us another 100,000 jobs.,0
Since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal ... 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.,0
So we've got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want.,1
And I'm pretty clear about that.,1
That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.,0
I think we want new jobs with rising incomes.,1
The jobs are leaving Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Hampshire, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, and all across this country.,0
I'm going to stop the jobs from leaving our country ... and I'm going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country.,0
It's going to be a new day in America.,0
For too long, we've rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own.,0
And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II.,1
And I have some specific ideas in mind.,1
Skyscrapers go up in Beijing, while plants and factories crumble in the United States.,0
We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.,1
They need to be upgraded and maintained and built.,1
Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico, and to other countries.,0
That is a question of competitiveness.,1
And now, Ford has announced it's moving all of its small car production to Mexico also.,0
We have to have a competitive economy.,1
Our airports are so rundown we don't even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because we're not using the newest technology.,1
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we want, we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers.,0
We're not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs.,1
I do want to bring advanced manufacturing.,1
We will also lower taxes on American business, from 35% to 15%, and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history.,0
I heard Ted Strickland talking about that.,1
Thousands of new companies, millions of new jobs, and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States.,0
I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance.,1
There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing.,1
I'm not interested in a race to the bottom, in competing for low-wage jobs.,1
I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs.,1
So let's lead in precision machining, 3D printing. ,1
But to be a rich nation, we must also be a secure nation.,0
And let's be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
Some nation's going to have that title.,1
Security begins at the border.,0
I think it's either going to be Germany or China or us.,1
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders.,0
In fact, as Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldn't take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals.,0
But she didn't do it.,0
The ICE officers, who endorsed me ... their first endorsement of a candidate ever ... issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clinton's immigration plans.,0
Let me read from it.,0
Again, this all a quote from the ICE officers: "Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S.,0
history.",0
It should be us.,1
"Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives, mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States, the total gutting of interior enforcement, the handcuffing of ICE officers, and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S.,0
borders.",0
Their quote continues.,0
No question it should be.,1
We're going to fight climate change.,1
"She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty, to expand catch- and-release, to expand President Obama's non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays, to support Sanctuary Cities, to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants, to grant amnesty within 100 days, to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty, plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees.",0
The ICE officers conclude by saying: "Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders.",0
And we're going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement.,1
That whole quote is from the nation's Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers.,0
I'm running against somebody who doesn't believe in climate change or at least he says he doesn't , who has even said he thinks it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
Well, right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do.,1
So maybe they think it's a hoax, but they're investing.,1
And they're creating.,1
In short, Hillary's immigration stance is disqualifying.,0
And they're going to want to export.,1
The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States ... anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation.,0
And what a shame it would be.,1
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now, and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely ... when I am President, we are getting them out, and we are getting them out quickly.,0
We have innovated.,1
At the same time, our country is being infiltrated by terrorists.,0
We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this.,1
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11.,0
And we're going to do it.,1
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey, and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota, were foreign nationals admitted into our country ... as was the mall shooter in Washington State.,0
The Boston Bombers were here on asylum.,0
The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fianc.. visa from Saudi Arabia.,0
When I am president, I want all of you who care about science, technology, engineering, mathematics, I want you to be part of it.,1
And while we are growing the economy, we are going to make it fairer.,1
We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty.,1
The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan.,0
Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees.,0
I am not running to be President of the world.,0
And don't you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work? ,1
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
You know, back in the spring, I was at a town hall in Las Vegas.,1
And the little girl raised her hand.,1
I am for America First.,0
We are going to build a border wall, enforce our laws, and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
We are also going to end the government corruption,0
And I called on her.,1
And she said to me, 'If you're elected president, does a girl president make the same as a boy president?',1
Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking.,0
Then she bleached and destroyed 33,000 emails ... after a congressional subpoena.,0
I said, "Well, that's one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make.",1
She lied to Congress, under oath, and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals.,0
It's worse than Watergate.,0
So we're going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly.,1
And I'll tell you something else.,1
I want to do more to promote profit-sharing.,1
If you help to make the profits, it shouldn't all just go to the executives and the shareholders.,1
Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
You should be able to share in that.,1
Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clinton's top aides to DESTROY their laptops.,0
Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote.,0
We are also going to fix our inner cities, and help Latino Americans,0
Now, there's a lot we can do.,1
And people say, 'Well, how are you going to pay for it?',1
Well, I'm going to go where the money is.,1
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.,0
And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country.,1
I have made a pledge, and you can hold me to it.,1
58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.,0
I will not raise taxes on the middle class.,1
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share.,1
The Democrats, like Hillary Clinton, have run the inner cities for 50 years, sixty years, seventy years or more.,0
Now, Donald Trump is the poster child for this.,1
Last night he finally admitted he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.,1
Now, he claims that's because back in the early 1990s, he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos.,1
They've produced only more joblessness, failing schools, and rising crime.,0
To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose?,0
Who loses money running casinos?,1
Really.,1
Vote For Donald Trump.,0
I will fix it.,0
Now, one of his supporters said, 'Well, the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didn't have to pay taxes made him a genius.',1
I will be your greatest champion, and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities.,0
Well, I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year.,1
I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty, and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation.,0
But I'll tell you what.,1
What that meant was he paid zero, zero for the military, zero for our vets, zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college.,1
And then he did something that, in retrospect, seemed both odd and not very smart.,1
Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy, and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
This Election Day, you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this country.,0
He brought in Warren Buffett.,1
He said, 'Well, everybody does this.,1
Warren Buffett does this.',1
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
So Warren Buffett, who, by the way, is a real billionaire, Warren Buffett, heard that, pretty hard to miss.,1
The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.,0
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation ... and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
And so he put out a statement today.,1
And here's what he said.,1
He said, 'I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944, when I was 13.',1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
We're going to make history together.,0
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
He said, 'I have copies of all 72 of my returns.,1
A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.,0
And none uses a carryforward.',1
You are voting to believe in yourselves.,0
You are voting to believe in your future.,0
That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share.,1
You are voting to believe in your country.,0
All together, we are going to ...,0
Make America wealthy again.,0
And then Warren Buffett ends by saying, 'Finally, I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited.,1
We are going to make America strong again.,0
I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit.',1
'Neither would Mr. Trump.,1
At least he would have no legal problem in doing so.',1
Well, if you take a shot at Warren Buffett, you'd better be prepared. ,1
And in fact, Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more.,1
He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him.,1
We are going to make America safe again.,0
And he has proposed what's called the Buffett rule, and I am absolutely behind that, and I've said that's one of the changes I want ... so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share.,1
Now, there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe.,1
And so, don't.,1
But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer.,1
And we are going to make America great again.,0
You know, he's not usually tongue-tied, but he had no answer when confronted about the report that he's been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs.,1
Now, I know you've seen reports and you've probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies.,1
He's had a lot of them across Ohio.,1
He claims to be on the side of workers.,1
The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country.,0
Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation, so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes.,0
He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers.,1
He even had the nerve ... this is what kills me about him ... he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.,1
This is collusion and corruption of the highest order, and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor.,0
We have to investigate the investigation.,0
Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a congressional subpoena ... and then destroyed her phones with a hammer ... all to cover-up her crimes.,0
People have gone to jail for doing far less.,0
She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars.,0
And the whole time he was hiding the truth.,1
Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel. ,1
These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty.,0
You know, when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price, and people like Trump buy it, that kills jobs.,1
It kills jobs in this state, including right here in Columbus.,1
This May, Columbus Castings, the biggest single-site foundry in America, just seven miles from where we are tonight, filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off.,1
Now, when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people, it really ... it really gets me upset.,1
There's no justification for it.,1
But it fits him to a T. For all his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
Trump's suits and ties were made in Mexico and China.,1
They could have been made right here in Ohio.,1
In fact, he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York.,1
This criminal government cartel doesn't recognize borders, but believes in global governance, unlimited immigration, and rule by corporations.,0
So we've got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing.,1
And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country, investment in workers, investment in plant and equipment, investment in research and development, and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others. ,1
We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms.,1
...,0
Even Chelsea Clinton, the WikiLeaks emails show, expressed "serious concerns" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department.,0
During a recent trip to Florida, I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti.,0
We're going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed, the Dodd-Frank rules.,1
The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country.,0
I also learned from them, firsthand, how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti.,0
New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti, which killed over 150,000 people, the Clintons couldn't stop cashing in.,0
Trump wants to do away with those.,1
As people were dying in Haiti, Clinton insiders were separating out requests from "Friends of Bill" or "William Jefferson Clinton VIPs" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment.,0
People who were labeled "Not Friends of Bill" were placed on the sidelines.,0
In their biggest project, the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S. taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop.,0
He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers.,1
He wants to do away with that.,1
And guess who set it up?,0
And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class.,1
Well, we're going to crack down on corporate fraud, like we've seen at Wells Fargo.,1
Cheryl Mills, Hillary's Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails, and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer.,0
The company that benefitted from Mills' actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills.,0
We're going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again.,1
Today, as Haiti's death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise, we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time.,0
And we're going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America.,1
If they try to leave, we're going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America.,1
To all of our friends in Haiti, your day of justice is coming, and it arrives on November 8th.,0
Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti, but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics.,0
This is deeply offensive.,0
We're also going to end the carried interest loophole.,1
I've been trying to get that done for years.,1
We're going to get it done.,1
We've got a couple of different ways of doing it.,1
I hope that Congress along with us, but if they don't, we're going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code, hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate, not for investing but just for moving money around.,1
It's just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans.,0
We've all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement, secret service, and others in uniform.,0
She even smeared all of America's police officers as essentially racist.,0
I'm proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect, especially our military and law enforcement personnel.,0
The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillary's staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile.,0
That's going to end.,1
The emails also show, yet again, that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton.,0
I want to reward the productive economy.,1
The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders' plans to the Clinton Campaign.,0
I don't want to keep rewarding the financial economy.,1
To all the Bernie voters out there: don't vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton.,0
A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, more Wall Street cheating, more terrible trade deals, and ... as confirmed by Wikileaks ... she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security.,0
...,0
That is not the way we're going to grow new businesses, and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans.,1
Now, people in Ohio often ask about, 'Well, what are we going to do about trade?',1
Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time.,0
Well, we're going to have smart and fair trade.,1
That's what I love about your Senator, Sherrod Brown.,1
The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign.,0
It's just one more way the system is rigged.,0
He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have.,1
Look.,1
We've got to trade with the rest of the world.,1
We're only 5 percent of the population of the world.,1
We've got to trade with the other 95 percent.,1
When I was Secretary of State, we really bore down on this, and we increased American exports 30 percent, and in particular, 50 percent to China, because we stood behind every American business.,1
We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell.,1
Reporters who work for these outlets ... like the Washington Post, or the New York Times ... may think of themselves as journalists, but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine.,0
The emails show the New York Times, Boston Globe, Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons, and smother the Clintons with praise.,0
And I've gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade.,1
The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories.,0
It's called corruption.,0
They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal.,1
So we're going to stand up.,1
I'm going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal we're already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us.,1
The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders.,0
And I've always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs?,1
Dona Brazile, the DNC Vice Chair, emailed: "from time to time I get the questions in advance.",0
Does it raise American incomes?,1
The media can't report on the establishment because the media is the establishment.,0
And they're all teamed up against you, the American people.,0
is it good for our national security?,1
...,0
And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, it fails my tests.,1
Once it was finally negotiated, I don't think it will do what I want it to do, so I oppose it.,1
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders, on trade, on foreign policy, on the economy, and so much more.,0
I oppose TPP now.,1
I'll oppose it after the election.,1
We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you, squandered our wealth, and sold our country.,0
I'll oppose it as president.,1
I am asking all Americans ... Republicans, Independents and Democrats ... to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people.,0
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation ... and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
But I'm going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world. ,1
I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security.,1
And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about, but I'll tell you what.,1
I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
That is off the table forever.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
So let's say yes to good jobs, but here's what else we need to say yes to.,1
Let's say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university.,1
I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well.,1
And for a lot of kids, they're not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade.,1
There's an achievement gap already.,1
There's also a digital gap; we have five million homes, mostly poor homes, without access to the internet, so they're behind.,1
I want this to be a true meritocracy.,1
You're going to remember this day.,0
I'm tired of inequality.,1
I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it. ,1
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful.,1
We're going to make history together.,0
I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education.,1
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school.,1
We need technical education for more young people.,1
A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.,0
Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We will make America wealthy again.,0
We will make America strong again.,0
We will make America safe again.,0
Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college, but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful.,1
I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses.,1
And we are going to make America great again.,0
We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers, for coders, for all kinds of skills.,1
In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
We are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
And then when it comes to college, I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself.,1
We both remember that college was affordable.,1
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
And it isn't for a lot of people now, and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities.,1
So here is our proposal.,1
We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125,000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free.,1
And for families over that line, we want you to go debt-free.,1
Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.,0
We are going to be a rich country again.,0
So yes, you pay what you can afford, but you don't have to go into debt to go to Ohio State.,1
And I'll tell you, the other big problem ... how many of you already have student debt?,1
We are also going to end government corruption.,0
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency ... and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.,0
Oh, wow.,1
Practically every hand.,1
The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.,0
The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.,0
Well, here's what we're going to do.,1
They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.,0
We're going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt.,1
They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.,0
If you can refinance your home mortgage, your car payment, or if Donald can refinance his airplane, you ought to be able to refinance your student debt. ,1
And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make, and have a limit on that, 10 percent, so that ...,1
I feel personally about this because that's what I did after law school.,1
They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.,0
To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails ... after a Congressional Subpoena ... she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.,0
My dad was a small businessman, and he really was a saver.,1
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes.,0
He didn't even have a credit card.,1
Didn't believe in that.,1
So he saved the money for me to go to college.,1
The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes ... and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them.,0
The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary ... supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren ... is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.,0
I had to work if I wanted to buy a book, but that was okay.,1
Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election.,0
That was the arrangement.,1
And then I told him I wanted to go to law school.,1
He said, 'You're on your own.,1
I don't have any money for that.',1
The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.,0
So I worked, I got a small scholarship, and I took out loans.,1
But we are going to stop it.,0
We are not going to back down.,0
We are not going to let it happen.,0
But boy, was I lucky, because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs.,1
In other words, when I got out of law school, I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund and make, I don't know, $14,000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income, not on an interest rate of 8, 10, 12 percent like I see from young people across America.,1
So that's what I want, but I also want to make it possible, if you do public service or national service, to have a lot of your loan, and maybe all of it, forgiven because you're going to be paying back to our country.,1
And I've got this idea about something I'm calling the National Service Reserve.,1
We are just getting started.,0
It's kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve.,1
Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption.,0
You get the training and you're kind of on call and you practice and train.,1
And then if you're needed, you're called up.,1
I want a civilian national reserve, and I want people of all ages in it.,1
They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.,0
This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.,0
And we would train you so that if there's a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with, we could call you up to go do that.,1
And it's a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because that's how we build solidarity.,1
That's how we get to know each other better. ,1
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.,0
By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.,0
When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.,0
Either we win the election, or we lose the country.,0
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.,0
When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities.,0
I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you ... we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.,0
So I'm pretty excited about what we're going to do together.,1
And I can't do any of this without your help.,1
I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure you're registered, to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure they're registered.,1
New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.,0
We have to solve this crisis.,0
I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.,0
Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.,0
As I said, go to iwillvote.com.,1
You can find it out right there on that site.,1
We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.,0
Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other.,0
And we'd love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November, we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again.,1
Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.,0
I think I have to do everything, everything in my power to bring people together, and I will.,1
It's really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not.,1
First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.,0
The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.,0
I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.,0
Obviously, I hope you do, but I will be your president, and I will stand up for you, and I will work for you, and I will fight for you.,1
We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.,0
We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.,0
We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.,0
So please, if you're not registered, get registered by tomorrow, and then you can start voting October 12th.,1
President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories.,0
Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.,0
Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system.,0
And whatever issue, whatever issue you care about, imagine that that is on the ballot.,1
Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.,0
Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.,0
These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.,0
Imagine if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, if you believe ... if you believe that we finally should have paid family leave in this country like every other advanced economy, if you believe climate change is real and we could save our planet by creating a lot of jobs at the same time, if you believe diversity is America's strength, not a weakness, if you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions and that LGBT Americans should be treated equally across America, and you should be able to live up to your potential, no matter who you are or where you come from, then start voting October the 12th!,1
And I promise you this.,1
A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.,0
Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.,0
It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction.,0
We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.,0
Together we're going to prove that we can make the future what it should be for all of you; that there is a positive, optimistic, confident America out there; that America's best days are ahead of us, not the dark and divisive vision of my opponent, but one in keeping with what I see as I travel across America ... the energy, the dynamism, the entrepreneurial spirit of all Americans, but particularly young Americans.,1
The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs.,0
And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.,0
Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives.,0
So please, join this campaign.,1
Be part of it for the next 29 days.,1
And together we will prove that we can have the future that we want and that yes, love trumps hate!,1
We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.,0
Thank you, Ohio State!",1
And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular, I want to thank all of the elected officials.,1
Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida.,1
Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.,1
Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach.,1
Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami.,1
As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.,0
At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.,0
Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.,0
Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.,0
Thanks to all the others who were part of the program.,1
This legislation is an important step.,0
I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment.,0
These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.,0
I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.,0
As we were coming in, we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd, and I was told as I was coming out, there's an overflow, but they can hear us in the overflow, and we're so happy you're here as well!,1
I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.,0
I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration.,0
So thanks to the overflow crowd.,1
But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the world's most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.,1
Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.,0
About a decade ago, Al made a movie called 'An Inconvenient Truth.',1
Now, maybe some of you have seen it, but if you haven't, I hope you'll watch it tonight.,1
It doesn't have a lot of special effects ... but it does have a lot of drama.,1
Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.,0
And here's the main message: climate change is real, it's urgent, and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it.,1
Right?,1
We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions.,1
But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.,0
We can transform our economy.,1
The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.,0
We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution.,1
And above all, we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.,1
At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.,0
Now, let me just say ... so, so let's remember, let's remember what's at stake.,1
I'm running against a guy who denies science, denies climate change, claims it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
So this is something that Al Gore's been working on for a really long time.,1
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.,0
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.,0
The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
Since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal ... 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.,0
That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.,0
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
And I want you to know how far back he goes.,1
It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen.,1
Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, Fiat,0
And then when Al became a senator, he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions, and as vice president, he led America's efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions.,1
Chrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.,0
Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.,0
You take all this together, those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.,1
If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA.,0
I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent, and in the face of a lot of people ... in public life, in business, in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science ... he never wavered.,1
And in the years since, the climate challenge has only grown more stark.,1
If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.,0
We are going to start making things in America again.,0
And I will tell you this, it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election.,1
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
Look at it this way.,1
We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.,0
Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.,0
Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change, to protect our planet, to protect our health, and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy.,1
Or in the alternative, we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk.,1
We will lower taxes massively on all Americans ... Hillary will raise your taxes massively.,0
So we've really got to get this right.,1
We will become the great jobs magnet of the world.,0
And if you need additional convincing, just remember what happened this week.,1
Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country, more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti.,1
North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week, if not longer.,1
Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.,0
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.,0
We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.,1
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
That's why I've encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon, the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew, or to UNICEF, helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.,1
Now, some will say, 'We've always had hurricanes.,1
They've always been destructive.',1
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation ... and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
And that's true.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change.,1
Right now, the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures ... and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas.,1
Sea levels have already risen about a foot ... one foot ... in much of the Southeast, which means that Matthew's storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.,1
Plus, as you know, the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes.,1
It's become a daily reality here in Miami.,1
We're going to make history together.,0
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide.,1
Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.,0
The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system.,1
We will make America wealthy again.,0
We will make America strong again.,0
We will make America safe again.,0
Sometimes, people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.,1
So, if you need proof that climate change is real and that it's costly, there you go.,1
So at this rate, at this rate, my friends, my friends, please.,1
Let's focus on what's really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country, because this is what I want you to hear and understand.,1
At the rate we are going, one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century, and when kids ... like that adorable young boy over there on his dad's shoulders ... are grandparents, we believe that's more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk, and nationwide, it's as much as $882 billion in property at risk.,1
But there's also health consequences.,1
And we are going to make America great again.,0
Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges.,1
And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse, which is especially bad for our children.,1
And look at what is happening in California, a brutal five-year drought.,1
I am so happy to be back here in Columbus.,0
Make sure you request your absentee ballot to vote by mail.,0
And remind your friends and family to do the same.,0
Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.,1
And it's also about national security.,1
We are now 26 days away from the most important election of our lifetimes.,0
And we've only begun to fight.,0
If we win, we will create a booming and thriving economy for young Americans.,0
The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our America's national security.,1
The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk, Virginia.,1
We will create safe communities, lower taxes, leaner government, affordable childcare and healthcare, and a government that is honest and decent and fair.,0
It's the largest naval installation in the world.,1
We are the campaign of change.,0
We will deliver jobs, opportunity and justice for future generations.,0
I've wanted this race to be about the issues.,0
And because of rising sea level, the base is frequently flooded, even when it's sunny.,1
But the Clinton Campaign has refused to discuss the issues.,0
They only place they want to go is the gutter.,0
So that's why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations, not just in Norfolk, but at all of our military bases around the world.,1
So they have slandered and libeled me with false accusations ... but we will not let these lies distract us from our campaign.,0
So you would think if you look at the facts, if you listen to the science, that even the most committed climate skeptic would say, 'Ok, I agree, something's happening here.,1
We need to take it seriously.',1
In an earlier speech today, I addressed the fact that I was falsely accused.,0
But unfortunately, there are still plenty of people ... in Washington, on the campaign trail ... who won't face what's happening right in front of us.,1
Donald Trump, is, quote, 'not a big believer' in climate change.,1
As I said, he said it's a hoax created by the Chinese.,1
And in our first debate two weeks ago, he tried to deny saying that.,1
But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.,1
And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida, like Miami Beach's Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these 'Sunny Day' Floods.,1
Or maybe, he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem..n. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner, John Elizabeth Alem..n. John Elizabeth is a Republican, but she's supporting our campaign...because she knows America can't afford a candidate who doesn't accept climate science.,1
Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security, or what about the ranchers in Colorado, or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say, 'Our lives and jobs and families are being affected ... please, let's come together as a country and do something about it.',1
We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House.,1
It is disgraceful that you can have front page articles in the New York Times inventing false claims, without any evidence, any witnesses, anything at all.,0
At all, that is absolutely unacceptable.,1
We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat, creating good jobs, and yes, saving our planet.,1
I want to talk about the policies affecting our lives, and your future.,0
So here's what I want to do.,1
First, we need to do a lot more on clean energy.,1
The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany, China, or us...and I want it to be us.,1
Right now, our government has been taken hostage by global special interests that will stop at nothing to drain every last ounce of wealth from this country for their personal benefit.,0
And I want you to be part of making it us.,1
The greatest weapon wielded by the Clinton Machine is the media.,0
The WikiLeaks emails show that the Clinton Machine and the Corporate Media are one in the same ... they collaborate and conspire together.,0
And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs, building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines.,1
Modernizing our electric grid.,1
This Washington establishment will stop at nothing to stop all of us.,0
These are the people who have given us decades of endless wars producing only death and bloodshed, but no victory.,0
These are the same people who have flung our doors open to Radical Islam, putting us on the same path to France of multigenerational struggles with violence and extremism embedded in our communities.,0
These are the people who've allowed violent international cartels to invade our country and prey on our most vulnerable citizens.,0
Victims like Marilyn Pharis, raped by an illegal immigrant with a lengthy criminal record and beaten to death with a hammer.,0
These are the people who've let drugs pour into our country and poising our children.,0
These are the people who emptied the jobs out of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina and shipped them to other countries.,0
The political powers trying to stop us are the people who've stripped the jobs form our inner cities, trapped millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans in impoverished, crime-besieged neighborhoods, and left 70 million American women and child in poverty or near the brink of poverty.,0
At the center of this assault on American prosperity is the Clinton Machine.,0
Retrofitting buildings.,1
They don't work for you, they don't work for America, the work only for themselves and their donors ... including foreign government and foreign actors.,0
Hillary Clinton is a criminal who destroyed 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena.,0
Building resilient, 21st century infrastructure, and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind...not our cities or our small towns or our remote, rural areas.,1
Now, you wouldn't know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is.,1
He has such a dark, divisive view of America, but that doesn't tell the story about what's really going on.,1
It's actually pretty exciting.,1
In red states and blue states, local leaders are stepping up.,1
Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America ... union workers in Michigan, union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy.,1
Iowa, Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind.,1
She ignored hundreds of requests for security in Benghazi, causing the deaths of four brave Americans ... and then she lied to the faces of the grieving parents about the reason for the attack.,0
She defended a man who violently and viciously raped a 12 year-old girl by horribly smearing and blaming the victim ... and the she laughed about getting the rapist off the hook.,0
Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie.,1
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank, Hillary pledged her support for "open borders.",0
Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America.,1
That means tens of millions of new foreign workers to compete against you for your jobs, your wages, your futures ... she's selling out the future of young American, of all backgrounds, to enrich her donors.,0
I think that is so exciting ... there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.,1
And in Spartanburg, South Carolina, a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm.,1
We won't let it happen.,0
That landfill was a blight and a health threat, just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood.,1
Now, that same land will generate enough clean, renewable electricity to power 500 homes.,1
So this is what we can do.,1
And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that.,1
As president, I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term.,1
And let's generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade.,1
Let's make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.,1
Hillary and her special interest allies want to keep children in our inner cities trapped in failing schools.,0
Under a Trump Administration, disadvantaged children will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice.,0
Under President Obama and Hillary Clinton, the national debt has almost doubled.,0
$20 trillion-dollar national debt is a weight around the future of every young person in this country.,0
And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research, to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies, investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing, putting big partnerships together between states, cities, and rural communities.,1
We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do.,1
It would require $120,000 from every millennial in the country to pay off.,0
The new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.,0
So I'm hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future.,1
The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America.,1
We want them manufactured in America, installed in America, and putting people to work in America.,1
And while we do that, let's make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us.,1
Yet, not one penny of that new debt has gone to lowering your tuition.,0
The share of 16-to-28-year-olds not in the labor force has increased to 45 percent during the Obama administration.,0
We need to invest in resilient infrastructure.,1
In a Trump Administration, we will work every day to make America great again for millennials.,0
First, we will Lower the Cost of College and Solve the Student Loan Crisis.,0
Tuition at public four-year institutions was 40% higher in the last school year than it was ten years ago.,0
In all, Americans owe $1.3 trillion on their student loans--more than auto loans, credit card debt, or home equity loans nationwide.,0
Now, sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times, let's be more creative ... like in New York Harbor, where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge.,1
Sometimes we'll overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours.,1
Students should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford, and the debt should not be an albatross around their necks for the rest of their lives.,0
In Philadelphia, they're trying something else: green roofs, porous pavements, curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.,1
That is why under my student loan program, we would cap repayment to an affordable portion of a borrower's income--12.5%.,0
And if borrowers work hard and make their full payments for 15 years, we will let them get on with their lives.,0
That's the nature of the deal we give many public employees today.,0
Every American deserves the same deal, so we will equalize treatment so everyone can start saving for their families and retirement by the time they are 15 years out of college.,0
In addition, I will take steps to push colleges to cut the skyrocketing cost of tuition.,0
If the federal government is going to subsidize student loans, it has a right to expect that colleges work hard to control costs and invest their resources in their students.,0
If colleges refuse to take this responsibility seriously, they will be held accountable--including by reconsidering whether those with huge endowments deserve to keep those endowments tax-exempt.,0
Some schools are paying more to hedge funds and private equity managers than they are spending on tuition assistance--while taxpayers are guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars of student loans to pay for rising tuition.,0
And here's something we don't talk enough about.,1
Let's make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster.,1
We want universities to spend their endowments on their students, not themselves.,0
Because sadly, I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy, newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital, because the electricity went off.,1
Nurses, I love nurses ... heroic, courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing.,1
Now, here in Miami, you know how important this is.,1
They need to use that money to cut the college debt and college tuition.,0
You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Children's Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason.,1
And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.,1
And then finally, we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge.,1
If we don't do it, nobody will do it.,1
We must confront the climate challenge.,1
Much of the skyrocketing cost of college education is due to the tremendous bloat in college administrators and bureaucrats.,0
According to the Department of Education, the number of college administrators is up more than 60 percent since 1993--ten times the increase in tenured faculty positions.,0
There's no doubt about that.,1
And so, let's move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.,1
Federal regulations are responsible for much of this administrative bloat.,0
When I was Secretary of State, I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority.,1
Vanderbilt University estimated that it spends $150 million per year---11 percent of the university's budget--to comply with government regulations.,0
As president, I will immediately take steps to drive down college costs by reducing the unnecessary costs of compliance with federal regulations so that colleges can pass on the savings to students in the form of lower tuition.,0
I will also make it a priority to protect students' rights to free speech on campus.,0
In the past few decades, political correctness has transformed our institutions of higher education from ones that fostered spirited debate, to a place of extreme censorship where students are silenced.,0
We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution.,1
In fact, we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark ... slip past the guards ... it was all very cloak and dagger.,1
But for a really important purpose, and because of that breakthrough, and a lot of patient, persistent work, and because of American leadership, 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December.,1
It's called the Paris Agreement.,1
And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last, best chance to solve the global, climate crisis.,1
And what does Donald Trump want to do?,1
We will end the political correctness, and foster free and respectful dialogue.,0
He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement.,1
We also have to recognize that traditional four-year degree programs are not the only path to a good job and a good career.,0
He doesn't care what it would do to the planet.,1
We should support schools that allow people to learn skills and practice a trade so young people can have access to the education that's right for them.,0
He doesn't care how much that would damage American leadership in the world.,1
He doesn't care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.,1
And we must hold all schools equally accountable for their performance.,0
I will make sure that students have the information they need about all of their options before starting school, and for repaying their student loans upon leaving school.,0
There is a lot of room for improvement in this regard.,0
Well, he may not care ... but we do.,1
Currently, students navigate 16 complex repayment plans, 8 forgiveness programs, and 32 deferment and forbearance options...each of these programs has their own nuances and qualifications.,0
And that's why this election is so critically important because on the ballot, it is not just my name.,1
It's every issue we care about it's our values as a country.,1
Climate change needs to be a voting issue.,1
I will simplify this confusing maze into a single Income-Based Repayment Program, similar to those that have proved so popular in recent years.,0
We need to elect people up and down the ballot, at every level of government, who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done.,1
Please, we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses...and certainly not to the White House.,1
We also have to make sure that those who have graduated college and those who are soon to graduate can find a good job to start a good career when they do.,0
Many mothers across this country are worried their kids won't find jobs, and they are right to be worried.,0
One of the biggest threats is outsourcing ... jobs for college-educated kids are being sent to other countries.,0
At the same time, companies are importing low-wage workers on H-1B visas to take jobs from young college-trained Americans.,0
We will protect these jobs for Americans.,0
My economic plan ... including tax, trade regulatory, and energy reforms ... will create 25 million new jobs and allow the private sector to grow at 4 percent per year.,0
And if you care about climate, your Senate race is also really important, and I'll tell you why.,1
This includes reforms to protect and expand the sharing economy--startups like Uber--that have managed to provide great services to consumers, and create lots of jobs in the process.,0
It is unacceptable, it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio, when asked about climate change to say, 'I'm not a scientist.',1
Well, why doesn't he ask a scientist and then maybe then he'd understand why it is so important that he, representing Florida, be committed to climate change?,1
That's why I hope that you'll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.,1
Finally, and most importantly, the foundation for a new prosperity will be a rededication to the constitutional rule of law.,0
A vote for me is a vote for change, and a vote for me is really a vote for you.,0
Together, we are going to make America great again.,0
Look, we need leaders who can get results.,1
In 24 days, we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House.,0
It's easy to stonewall.,1
Make sure to get your absentee ballots.,0
It's not enough to protest: we need creativity, we need hard work.,1
Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
And when it comes to climate change, we don't have a minute to waste.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
So, I know it's easy to get cynical...especially about our politics.,1
We are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers, spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory, and destroyed our middle class.,0
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
I get that.,1
But this election matters more than any has in a really long time, and I believe that as strongly as I can, we've got to address this issue for our sakes, our children, our grandchildren.,1
And it's so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.,1
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
And just look, if you will ... look at the difference between your state, the Sunshine State, which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now.,1
Your companies won't be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration.,0
We are going to be a rich country again.,0
And do you know why?,1
We are also going to end government corruption.,0
Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs ... her private position ... then lies to you, the public, with her public position.,0
Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words 'climate change.',1
So my friends, this is a big deal in the election, and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world.,1
And there isn't anybody ... there isn't anybody who knows more, has done more, has worked harder.,1
I know he was in Miami just last year, training and educating people to be climate change activists.,1
I can't wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States.,1
It's all a fraud.,0
So please join me in welcoming our former vice president, a climate change leader and an all-around great guy, Al Gore.",1
<i>Audience:</i> Hillary!,1
Hillary!,1
Hillary!,1
Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails ... after a Congressional Subpoena ... she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing.,0
Thank you so very, very much.,1
Wow.,1
I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you.,1
Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes.,0
The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes ... and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them.,0
I am thrilled.,1
The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary ... supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren ... is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.,0
And I can't thank you enough.,1
Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election.,0
And it's a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader, someone who has served not only this state so well, but also our country.,1
The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.,0
But we are going to stop it.,0
And so I want to thank -- once again, I want to thank former senator and former secretary, Ken Salazar. ,1
And I also want to thank somebody else who's here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you.,1
And that is your senator, and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington, Michael Bennet.,1
I also want to recognize someone who's running a great race for congress, Gail Schwartz.,1
We are not going to back down.,0
I -- I was thinking -- I was thinking, the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992.,1
I was here for somebody else, namely my husband who was running for president.,1
And I know there are a lot of really young people here, but was anybody here back in 1992?,1
Well, Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time.,1
And it is always a treat for either one of us to come.,1
We are not going to let it happen.,0
And today, it's especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election.,1
We have only just begun to fight.,0
Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption.,0
And we're also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time, you are all going to be able to vote by mail.,1
And this Monday, October 17th, ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters.,1
This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.,0
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
Now, if you've already registered to vote, I hope you'll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot.,1
Send it back as quick as you can.,1
Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers.,0
Don't wait to fill it out.,1
Don't do what I do, put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon you're wondering, "Where is that ballot?,1
By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.,0
I know it cam here a few days ago.",1
By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.,0
Either we win the election, or we lose the country.,0
Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism within our shores.,0
So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night.,1
And maybe -- if you haven't registered to vote yet, please do it right now.,1
She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States.,0
And if you go to Iwillvote.com, you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered.,1
Pretty easy, huh?,1
Because we need everybody to vote in this election.,1
And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach, because this is about something so important.,1
I don't know that there's ever been a more serious or consequential election.,1
And we can see that people feel that way, because across America, people are already voting in high numbers.,1
A lot of states have what's called early vote, and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought.,1
So let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
And bigger than they've been in the past.,1
Just this morning in Ohio, people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote.,1
They couldn't wait to cast their ballots.,1
And by the time we're done, we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election.,1
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl.,0
So don't be left out because we need you.,1
In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home.,0
He left her on the side of a dirt road.,0
What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors?,0
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.,0
Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head ... after his release, he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick.,0
A wall will not only keep out criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.,0
Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace.,0
And oh by the way, if you've got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too.,1
We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent.,1
I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis.,0
And you know, your vote can make all the difference.,1
I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore.,1
My plan begins with a strong border, includes the prosecution of drug dealers, and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction.,0
And as he said yesterday, take it from him, every vote counts.,1
But, if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans, we must also solve our jobs crisis.,0
At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.,0
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.,0
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.,0
So don't sit this one out.,1
And I'm very proud of the campaign we've run.,1
I'm proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
When I am President, everything will change.,0
It was about -- it was about issues, not insults.,1
We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America.,1
We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls.,0
We will end our chronic trade deficits.,0
And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead.,1
We will start growing again.,0
And to me, that is what we're supposed to be doing.,1
We're supposed to bring people together.,1
We're supposed to unify our country.,1
We're supposed to solve our problems by working together.,1
And I know it's been a long race, but as soon as our primary finished, Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt, provide more healthcare.,1
And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness.,1
You know, the other night -- did you see that last debate?,1
Well, I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower.,1
And I was reminded of what my friend, and our first lady, Michelle Obama says.,1
When they go low, we go high.,1
And I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone.,1
We'll rebuild our roads, schools, bridges, tunnels, railways, hospitals and airports.,0
The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
Since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal ... 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.,0
I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers.,1
That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.,0
I want to bring people together across our party lines, across any lines that divide us.,1
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
And not just people who vote for me, I want to be the president, yes, for Democrats, but also Republicans and Independents.,1
And I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me.,1
If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA.,0
If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.,0
We are going to start making things in America again.,0
And I am very -- I'm very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me, some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before.,1
So we're going to keep running this campaign.,1
I want to give you something to vote for, not just something to vote against.,1
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
And during these next 28 days, we're going to crisscross our country.,1
We're going to be talking about what we can do together.,1
But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone.,1
His campaign -- his campaign said today that they're going to use a, quote, "scorched Earth" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race.,1
We will lower taxes massively on all Americans ... Hillary will raise your taxes massively.,0
Now, that just shows how desperate they are.,1
Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class ... this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare.,0
Reagan's tax cuts in the eighties, and Kennedy's tax cuts in the sixties, brought us tremendous growth.,0
My economic reforms ... on taxes, trade, regulation and American energy ... will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade.,0
That's all they have left, pure negativity, pessimism.,1
It's the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.,0
We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land.,0
President Obama, with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton, issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87,000 acres in Maine into a new "National Monument.",0
And we're not going to let Donald Trump get away with it, are we?,1
No consideration was made for local concerns, impacts to jobs, or the Maine forestry sector.,0
No approval by Congress.,0
Your state legislature opposed it.,0
It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good.,0
I don't care what he says about me.,1
Obama and Clinton don't care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine.,0
But we are going to turn it all around.,0
I -- I -- I care about what he says about you.,1
And I'll tell you what, I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him.,1
Now, the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women.,1
America's comeback begins on November 8th.,0
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
And he is doubling-down on his excuse that it's just, quote, "locker room talk.",1
Well, you know what happened?,1
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.,0
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
It just kind of happened spontaneously.,1
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.,0
A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook.,1
I mean, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the NFL, and more.,1
They are coming together and they're saying, "That doesn't happen in our locker rooms.",1
I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.,0
But of course, you know, it's not only women that he has disrespected.,1
He's insulted practically everybody.,1
I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.,0
I'm going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise, and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.,0
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors.,0
He went after a distinguished federal judge, Judge Curiel, who was born in Indiana.,1
I'm going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable ... and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens.,0
And Trump said, "Well, he couldn't be trusted because his parents were Mexican.",1
He has targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos.,1
I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans.,0
He's targeted POWs, people with disabilities, moslems, and so many others.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
And every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared, writing me a letter or talking to me.,1
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
We're going to make history together.,0
And especially children.,1
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.,0
It's really who Donald Trump is.,1
We will make America wealthy again.,0
We will make America powerful again.,0
But when you scare children, you know, like a little boy.,1
We will make America strong again.,0
His mother wrote to me.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
And we will make America great again.,0
She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,1
There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families.,1
Their parents, their grandparents were not around.,1
And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old.,1
We are one nation.,0
He's only lived in the United States.,1
And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump, he turned to her and asked, 'Mommy, will he send me back to Ethiopia?',1
When one state hurts, we all hurt ... and we must all work together to lift each other up.,0
That's the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death, especially the children, that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door, school to school, business to business, home to home.,1
And it is hard to explain to children.,1
And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said, you will reassure them.,1
Working, building, restoring together.,0
I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you.,1
Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences.,0
And that in this election, we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents.,1
Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.,0
We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.,0
Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.,0
Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.,0
But here's what I also want to know.,1
On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going.,1
On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.,0
Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.,0
You know, Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.,1
The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens.,0
You know, that's called trickle down economics, but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump, he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever, ever had.,1
So I believe differently.,1
If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end ... and it will end very quickly.,0
We're going to invest in the middle class.,1
We're going to invest in you, in your jobs, in your future.,1
Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.,0
<i>Audience:</i> Hillary!,1
Hillary!,1
To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people.,0
But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.,0
We cannot make America great again if we leave any community behind.,0
Hillary!,1
Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.,0
Well, you know, you do have to feel a little sorry for them.,1
Jobs, safety, opportunity.,0
They've had a really bad couple of weeks.,1
Fair and equal representation.,0
This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.,0
But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.,0
As you know, I am not a politician.,0
I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life.,0
But you know, part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences.,1
You know, Donald grew up the son of a millionaire.,1
I've never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct ... it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.,0
He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad.,1
So it's not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy, because that's his own experience.,1
I grew up differently.,1
Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.,0
My father was a factory worker.,1
I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.,0
Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.,0
Well, my grandfather was a factory worker.,1
But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.,0
My father was a small businessman.,1
I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.,0
I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us, and that's what I want to make sure everybody gets.,1
I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.,0
I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need ... and so many are not making it.,0
They are dying.,0
That's why I believe we've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, and we're going to focus on those issues.,1
I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.,0
We're going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure.,1
We need to fix our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports and our airports.,1
And we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because here's what we've learned, Donald Trump hasn't paid a penny in federal income tax in years.,1
Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans ... Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals ... who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them.,0
Now this is all allegedly because of course we don't know for sure because he won't release his income taxes but it's allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos.,1
Now I ask you, who loses $1 billion running casinos, right?,1
Do you know how hard that is?,1
But think about it, it means he's contributed zero.,1
Zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military.,1
He calls the United States military a disaster.,1
Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America.,1
Now, you've all heard his slogan, Make America Great Again, right?,1
Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America.,1
All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.,0
There are so many examples but let me just give you one, which is close to your hearts, because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America, right?,1
So you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry.,1
Now, Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it.,1
No truth to it, but you know, he did say it over and over again and we've slowly but surely uncovered how little he's done to help anybody except Donald Trump.,1
These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels.,0
And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings.,1
The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.,0
I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.,0
Not American steel.,1
Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people.,0
He could be buying American steel, he should be buying American steel.,1
Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.,0
If he wants to make America great again, start by America with American steel.,1
Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country.,0
This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight ofour lives ... together ... to save our country.,0
I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure, which uses American steel, we're going to do more on advanced manufacturing, on technology and innovation, on clean energy jobs and we're going to make the economy fairer at the same time.,1
And here's what I want the young people and their families to hear.,1
I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream.,0
Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved.,0
Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan.,1
We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else.,1
Let our children be dreamers too.,0
If you already have debt because you're trying to get your education, we're going to help you refinance it.,1
It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you can't refinance your student debt.,1
Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.,0
And we're going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income.,1
Now, based on this plan, we will save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save.,1
When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.,0
In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.,0
Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt.,1
If something isn't working, you replace it.,0
And we're also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time won't be in poverty.,1
If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.,0
I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.,0
And we're going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women.,1
That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity.,0
A future where America, and its people, always ... and I mean always ... come first.,0
Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?,0
And we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform.,1
I'm going to introduce reform.,1
Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises?,0
I can't wait to work with Senator Bennet, I can't wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning.,1
We're gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens.,1
I also think it is past time, don't you, to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because it's not only a woman's issue it's a family issue.,1
If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister it's your issue.,1
Right?,1
You know that.,1
And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.,0
Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?,0
So Donald Trump always says, you know I'm playing the woman card.,1
That is all about to change ... and it's about to change soon.,0
And my response is pretty simple.,1
If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the woman's card, then deal me in.,1
We are going to put the American people first again.,0
I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.,0
You see I am very excited, I am very excited about what we could do.,1
In this journey, I will never lie to you.,0
I will never tell you something I do not believe.,0
I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.,0
And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.,0
I have no special interest.,0
I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign ... nobody else is.,0
My only interest is the American people.,0
So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth.,0
You know I give President Obama a lot of credit.,1
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.,1
One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.,0
The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.,0
Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?,0
Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?,0
I remember, because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election.,1
Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?,0
And I didn't know why.,1
He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didn't know that.,1
Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?,0
Has she apologized for Iraq?,0
For Libya?,0
But I got there and the first thing he says is, "It's so much worse than they told us.",1
For Syria?,0
Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?,0
Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?,0
And it was.,1
Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran.,0
You remember.,1
He denied it was for the hostages, but it was.,0
He said we don't pay ransom, but he did.,0
He lied about the hostages ... openly and blatantly ... just like he lied about Obamacare.,0
It was terrible.,1
Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped.,0
Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.,0
Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time.,1
Let's talk about the economy.,0
We have dug ourselves out of that ditch, thanks to everybody's hard work.,1
And we can't ever go back there because believe me, trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place.,1
And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street.,1
He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which returns money to people who've been defrauded by big companies.,1
Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA.,0
Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it.,0
North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.,0
Well I have a totally different view.,1
We're gonna keep those and then we're going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to they're gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny, every penny, of tax benefit they've ever gotten.,1
Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization ... another Hillary Clinton-backed deal.,0
And I've been very clear about how we're gonna pay for what I want to do.,1
Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State ... our chief diplomat with China.,0
It is going to be going after the wealthy, closing the loopholes on corporations.,1
I can pledge to you, I will never raise middle class federal taxes.,1
It is not right.,1
She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.,0
Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.,0
And what I've been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues.,1
And we thank you very much.,1
Another major issue in this campaign has been the border.,0
What - right now - thank you.,1
Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities.,0
So much needless suffering, so much preventable death.,0
I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.,0
I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border.,0
You know, I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo.,1
Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.,0
My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.,0
I think I'll come here anytime it gets hard in the White House.,1
What do you say?,1
But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle?,0
Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?,0
Finally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids.,1
You know, there is nothing more important.,1
Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?,0
I'm now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren, a little girl, a little boy.,1
And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children.,1
So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit.,1
It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs.,1
I'm going to double - I'm going to double the child tax credit.,1
That's another $1,000 for young kids to pay for the things you need, whether it's child care, housing, prescription drugs, groceries, or anything else, it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and we're going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most.,1
We're going to lift families out of poverty.,1
These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians.,0
In fact, the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and we're going to look for other ways to help you.,1
What I am interested in is your success, your futures, your possibilities, your dreams.,1
I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives.,1
That is how I was raised.,1
They certainly don't get apologies.,0
They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.,0
That's what I want for you and every single family, every single child in America!,1
So we have about four weeks ago.,1
It's going to be - it's going to be a race to the finish line, my friends.,1
But they will always come first to me.,0
And here is what I want to ask you.,1
As I said in the beginning, think about everything that is important to you, whether it is jobs and rising incomes, whether it is education, healthcare, whatever it might be.,1
Whether it is protecting our rights.,1
Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families.,0
People who have fought so hard, whether it is immigration reform, whatever it might be, think about it because you know what?,1
We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.,0
Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.,0
Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security.,0
I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests.,0
I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs.,0
Those issues will be on the ballot.,1
I will never put the special interests before the national interest.,0
I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.,0
Instead, I will be a champion for the people.,0
They may not be listed there, but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump.,1
And I know that if people turn out, I know if people show up, we're going to win and we're going to be able to do everything I've talked about.,1
The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives.,0
They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.,0
And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail, you fill it in, you send it back, you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted.,1
You know, when I think about this election, I do think about my grandchildren a lot.,1
Yeah, you, too, right?,1
I'll tell you what, for those of you who aren't grandparents yet, it is an incredible experience.,1
Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed ... she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.,0
Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.,0
Right?,1
And there is nothing I wouldn't do for them.,1
Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools.,0
Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.,0
As I like to say, face time was invented for grandparents, and you get to check in and see how they're doing.,1
But more than that, what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?,1
Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders.,0
I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child.,1
It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.,0
So many people suffering in silence.,0
Make sure every child has a good education, a good school, good teachers, and every zip code in America.,1
No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.,0
So again, it's not about me.,0
Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs.,1
It's never been about me.,0
That's why I work to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, so we can take care of millions of children.,1
That's why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids.,1
It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.,0
I am running to be their voice.,0
I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.,0
I got into this work so many years ago.,1
I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again ... including some powerful people in my own party.,0
Because it means I am fighting for real change.,0
There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, right out of law school.,1
Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.,0
And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids.,1
And the reason I did that is because of my own mother.,1
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.,0
I didn't know it when I was just a little girl, but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own, and then at the age of eight, holding her little three-year-old sister's hand, she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents.,1
It turned out the grandparents didn't really want her either.,1
The insiders fighting for the insiders.,0
So by the age of 14, she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter.,1
I am fighting for you.,0
Here is the change I propose.,0
On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.,0
We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism.,0
I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.,0
But here's what I want you to know.,1
It sounds pretty harsh.,1
It was difficult.,1
It made a profound impression on her life.,1
I think my mom, who lived to the wonderful age of 92, I don't think there was a day that went by that she didn't think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own.,1
On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed.,0
All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people.,0
Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa.,0
If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life.,0
But, along the way, people were kind to her.,1
People helped her.,1
Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.,0
The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day, because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school, so she said to her, Dorothy, if you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.,1
We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.,0
Now, you'll have to come right back home.,1
My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
That might sound kind of unfortunate, but for my mom, it was a gift, because she really wanted to go to high school.,1
Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration.,0
Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.,0
And so my mother always cared about other people.,1
We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.,0
And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else, right.,1
On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world.,0
We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.,0
And we need to show each other more kindness and support.,1
And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away, we should be drawing people toward us.,1
We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children.,1
The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one.,0
That's what I think about when I imagine, if I'm so fortunate enough to become president, I think about waking up -- waking up ...,1
Their day is over.,0
On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.,0
I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with?,1
How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential?,1
That's what I think we are called to do.,1
Whether you're a person of faith or not, the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up.,1
Nobody, nobody makes it alone.,1
Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way.,1
Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.,0
So let's pull together, Pueblo, let's get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children.,1
God bless you, thank you.",1
On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses ... creating millions of new good paying jobs.,0
I have to say it's great to be back on the campaign trail.,1
As you may know, I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia.,1
I tried to power through it, but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good.,1
We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.,0
And I'm not great at taking it easy, even under ordinary circumstances.,1
But with just two months to go until Election Day?,1
On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive.,0
We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones.,0
My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy.,0
She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.,0
Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be.,1
But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift.,1
I talked with some old friends.,1
I spent time with our very sweet dogs.,1
I did some thinking.,1
We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities ... and what a big difference that will make.,0
This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.,0
The campaign trail doesn't really encourage reflection, and it's important to sit with your thoughts every now and then.,1
On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about.,1
People like me ... we're lucky.,1
Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina.,0
When I'm under the weather ... now, I just want to have a conversation, and other people can wave their arms and their signs.,1
But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky.,1
We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare ... at a much lower cost.,0
On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.,0
When I'm under the weather, I can afford to take a few days off.,1
In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.,0
No one will be above the law.,0
I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.,0
Millions of Americans can't.,1
They either go to work sick, or they lose a paycheck, don't they?,1
I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.,0
Finally, we are going to bring this country together.,0
Lots of Americans still don't even have insurance, or they do but it's too expensive for them to actually use.,1
So they toss back some Tylenols, they chug orange juice, and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own.,1
We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans.,0
Lots of working parents can't afford childcare, which in many states costs as much as college tuition.,1
So for millions of moms and dads, if they get sick, there's no backup.,1
We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.,0
They're on their own, aren't they?,1
If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing.,0
Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership ... look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working.,0
It is time for change.,0
What do you have to lose by trying something new?,0
That's the story for too many people still in America.,1
...,0
When illness strikes, or an accident happens, you feel you're on your own.,1
I will fix it.,0
This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.,0
If you lose your job or can't afford college, you're on your own.,1
Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted.,0
If your aging parent starts needing more help, and you don't know what to do, you're on your own.,1
Life events like these are catastrophic for some families, but mere bumps in the road for others.,1
I have met so many people living on a razor's edge, one illness away from losing their job, one paycheck away from losing their home.,1
Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.,0
It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.,0
And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans.,1
In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.,0
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.,0
This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.,0
Because some things should not come down to luck.,1
Some things should be within reach for everyone, no matter what.,1
Like financial security.,1
Like affordable health care.,1
But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.,0
Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong, your family will be okay.,1
72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track.,0
I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.,0
It is time to vote for a New American Future.,0
And above all, the knowledge that no matter what, your president is fighting for you and will always have your back.,1
That right there, that's why I got into this race.,1
I am running for everyone working hard to support their families, everyone who's been knocked down but gets back up.,1
Together, We will make America strong again.,0
The factory workers on their feet all day, and the nurses looking after patients all night.,1
We will make American proud again.,0
I'm running for young people like so many of you here, who dream of changing our world for the better, and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
I'm running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen.,1
Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, we will make America great again.,0
Thank You, and God Bless.,0
We are going to declare our independence from media executives that don't care about us, and politicians who don't listen to us.,0
We are going to declare our independence from rising crime, soaring poverty and crushing debt.,0
And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are, just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina.,1
Look at what's happening with the NCAA and the ACC.,1
This is where bigotry leads, and we can't afford it ... not here, not anywhere else in America. ,1
We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future.,0
Once again, we will have a government of, by, and for the people.,0
Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.,0
I'm running for women like Janelle Turner.,1
It's going to be America First from now on.,0
Let me tell you what this new future looks like.,0
Back in May of last year, Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer.,1
She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments.,1
We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs.,0
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
Last October, she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read, 'Thirteenth chemo yesterday.,1
We are going to appoint judges who will support, defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States.,0
Three more.,1
We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment.,0
We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility, or with the private doctor of their choice.,0
Hear me roar!',1
We're going to eliminate job-killing regulations.,0
We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.,0
Wouldn't you want to meet the woman behind that sign?,1
Well, I sure did.,1
So we got talking, and we've stayed in touch.,1
She keeps promising me she'll see me at the inauguration.,1
Let's talk about another issue that is important to our future, and the future of our children.,0
And I tell her I'll keep working to get there, but she'd better be there too.,1
I'm running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids.,1
But perhaps most of all, I'm running for those kids.,1
Standing up for children has been the work of my life.,1
As a lawyer with the Children's Defense Fund, as First Lady in Arkansas, in the White House, as a Senator, I have fought for kids housed in adult jails, kids who have been neglected and abused, kids who couldn't get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions, kids with disabilities so they could go to school.,1
You heard today from someone I've known for a long time, now grown up and a lovely young woman, Anastasia Somoza.,1
I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can.,1
That's the issue of crime.,0
And to me, that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials.,1
Violent crime is rising across the country.,0
So when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported, it hits me right in the gut.,1
More than 2,700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year.,0
When I meet a little boy in Flint, Michigan, who can't drink the water at home or in school because it's poisoned with lead, that gets me going.,1
No American should consider this level of crime acceptable.,0
Every American has the right to live in safety and peace.,0
All I want to do is get to work making things better for them.,1
A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order.,0
Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers.,0
That's why I care so much about national security too.,1
I want to give our kids a safer world.,1
This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers, and the wounding of another 7, in the assault on Dallas.,0
We pray for the families, and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded.,0
To all law enforcement in America: we are with you, we support you, and we will always stand with you.,0
To me, that means a world with strong allies, more friends, fewer enemies, and fewer nuclear weapons.,1
Together, we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land ... but especially those who have not known safety in a very, very long time.,0
It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet.,1
My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts.,1
That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law.,0
I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs, cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people.,0
I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear.,0
Just a few days ago he said that if another country's troops taunted ours ... not fired at them, but taunted them, just taunts ... he'd responded ... he would respond by blowing them out of the water.,1
All citizens deserve to be protected.,0
No American left behind.,0
I want every African-American parent in this country ... and all parents in this country ... to be able to raise their kids in safety.,0
And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country ... and all children in this country ... are put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.,0
We are going to have school choice, charter schools, and merit-pay for teachers.,0
My opponent, Hillary Clinton, discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy.,0
He would start a war over that.,1
That is just one more reason, my friends, why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes.,1
I've been involved in politics in one way or another for many years.,1
No one owns me.,0
It is not an easy business.,1
It can get rough and I've built up some defenses.,1
When it comes to public service, I'm better at the 'service' part than the 'public' part.,1
But this is why I do it, and this is who I'm in it for: to make life better for children and families.,1
And that's what this race has always been about for me.,1
I answer only to the American people.,0
Well, now we're in the final stretch.,1
There are just 54 days till Election Day.,1
Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes.,1
And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina.,1
In a New York Post column, Deroy Murdock, published data confirming what I've been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities.,0
Murdock confirms these facts:,0
Let's make these days count, particularly here, because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do ... make it harder for young people to vote, harder for people of color, harder for people with disabilities, harder for the elderly.,1
"The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent ... down 3.2 percent.,0
There can't be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person, every person of color, every person with a disability, every older person turns out and votes.,1
So in these final days, let's try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesn't often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs, to create opportunity, to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future.,1
Let's talk about what really matters.,1
And here's my promise to you.,1
I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor ... focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.,1
This metric also slumped for black teenagers, from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent ... down 6.4 percent.,0
Next week, I'll go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida, to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyone's contributions, in-cluding people with disabilities; then I'll be back here in North Carolina, to meet with more working families.,1
The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama, the Census Bureau reports, from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 ... up 1.6 percent.,0
The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama ... from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 ... up 58.2 percent.,0
Also, from Obama's arrival through last June 30, the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent, the Census reports ... down 9.5 percent.",0
Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty.,0
From now until November 8th, everywhere I go, I'm going to talk about my ideas for our country.,1
My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas ... yes, somebody actually counted.,1
Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimer's to supporting people with autism.,1
You see, I have this old-fashioned notion that if you're running for president, you should say what you plan to do, how you're going to get it done, and how you're going to pay for it.,1
You can read it all on my website, hillaryclinton.com.,1
We even put it in a new book called, you guessed it, Stronger Together.,1
Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do.,1
Now, like a lot of women, I have a tendency to over-prepare.,1
58 percent of young African Americans are not employed.,0
I sweat the details, whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint, or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs, or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal.,1
Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore.,0
Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities.,0
Because you know what?,1
This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton.,0
It's not a detail if it's your kid.,1
It's not a detail if it's your family.,1
To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new?,0
Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs, higher wages, and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities.,0
We are going to turn it all around.,0
It's a big deal.,1
And it should be a big deal to your president. ,1
Success must be created for everyone, and available to everyone.,0
Now, I confess, I'll never be the showman my opponent is, and that's okay with me.,1
Just look at ... look at the show he put on with Dr. Oz today.,1
But I am going to deliver for you and your family, just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Children's Health Insurance Program, that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is.,1
That is how we are going to create a New American Future.,0
But to make every American safe and prosperous, we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security.,0
We are going to build a wall.,0
And I'll tell you something else.,1
People accuse me of all kinds of things.,1
You probably have seen that.,1
But nobody ever accuses me of quitting.,1
We are going to enforce the law.,0
We are going to protect your jobs and wages.,0
And I will never give up, I'll never walk away, no matter how tough the going gets.,1
I'm actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his.,1
And we are going to keep our country safe.,0
According to the Texas government, nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016.,0
We don't need a president who says the minimum wage is too high.,1
Collectively, those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses, including 1,055 homicides, 5,516 sexual assault charges and more than 50,000 charges of either burglary or theft.,0
Yet, Hillary Clinton wants a totally, completely open border.,0
We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage.,1
We don't need a president who wants to take away people's health coverage.,1
We need a president who wants everyone to have quality, affordable health care.,1
She wants catch-and-release.,0
Obamacare for illegal immigrants.,0
Massive amnesty in her first 100 days.,0
She wants to gut immigration enforcement.,0
And we don't need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids.,1
She supports Sanctuary Cities.,0
She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal.,0
We don't need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms.,1
We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues, who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes.,1
One lawless order after another.,0
We must not let it happen.,0
Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing, San Bernardino and Orlando.,0
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider.,0
I want to create safe zones in the Middle East.,0
Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side, respect your family, stand up and fight for you and your kids. ,1
That is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention, when we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between Democrat or Republican.,1
My plan suspends visas when we can't perform effective screening, and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who don't support our values.,0
After all, that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about.,0
This election will decide whether or not we have a border.,0
It's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.,1
This election will decide whether or not we have a country.,0
Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports.,0
It's also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations.,1
People have to decide, are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top?,1
Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart?,1
Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe, or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build? ,1
Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families, she will never hear these stories.,0
These are all forgotten Americans ... they are not Hollywood or media stars, or big money special interest donors.,0
She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests.,0
This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy.,0
Now, I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country.,1
My opponent keeps running us down, saying we're weak, a disaster, an embarrassment.,1
Every day more and more alarming facts come out.,0
The scandal I speak of is the State Department's Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton.,0
Every time he says things like that, I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer, or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges, and that little boy in Flint, who gets up every day and goes to school even though he can't drink the water.,1
If our Secretary of State can be bought, or bribed, or sell or trade government favors, then the whole American system is threatened.,0
See, my opponent has America all wrong.,1
There's nothing we can't do when we come together as one nation, set big goals, and pursue them.,1
It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself.,0
And the American dream ... the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise.,1
This is what happens in a Third World country ... it's the failed conditions people flee when they come to America.,0
So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty, join us.,1
If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions, join us.,1
If you believe ... if you believe your working mother, wife, sister, or daughter deserves equal pay, then join us.,1
Get involved these last 55 days.,1
America can never elect a candidate who, like Hillary Clinton, did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash.,0
Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246.,1
We need volunteers right here in North Carolina.,1
The new revelations about Hillary Clinton's email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.,0
Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes.,0
We can't do this without you.,1
And remember, the presidential race isn't the only one this fall.,1
We've got a lot of im-portant statewide races.,1
That's why she deleted 33,000 emails.,0
Let's come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate.,1
Starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county.,1
That's also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public.,0
So the heat is on.,1
She said she never sent or received classified materials.,0
That was a lie, proved over and over again.,0
She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device.,0
Spread the word.,1
But she used multiple devices.,0
Another lie.,0
Tell your friends, your family, your neighbors.,1
If you share our vision for America's future, come be part of helping us shape it.,1
We do not have a minute to lose.,1
We have so many blessings.,1
Under penalty of perjury, she said she turned over all of her work-related emails.,0
But the FBI found thousands she never turned over, and now just found another 15,000 more.,0
Another Clinton lie.,0
She said she sent nothing marked classified.,0
Now it's our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person, and particularly every child, no matter who they are, what they look like, or who they love, is part of the American dream now and way into the future.,1
A total lie, unmasked to the world.,0
Let that be our message.,1
Let that be our mission.,1
Please come out and help us fight, fight for you, fight for our children, fight for our families.,1
Let's make America all that it should be.,1
And more to come.,0
She said her server was secure, and had no breaches.,0
But we know now it was completely unsecure, and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies.,0
More Clinton lies.,0
Thank you and God bless you!",1
Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them.,0
Please everyone be seated.,1
This is such a great opportunity to lift up the work that so many of you have done for years -- your organizations, individually -- and I am grateful for it because it has helped to guide me in a lot of the work that I've been privileged to do.,1
One more Hillary Clinton lie.,0
I want to thank Gwen Hess for her introduction.,1
Lie after lie after lie.,0
Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office.,0
It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins.,0
It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons' set up a business to profit from public office.,0
They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money.,0
I want to acknowledge, it's always great to see a woman serve as president in any setting. ,1
I want to congratulate today's honorees.,1
Everyone is so deserving of this recognition.,1
I also want to acknowledge a few others.,1
We have some fierce members of Congress with us today, women whom I admire, who have been my colleagues and friends and with whom I am looking forward to continuing our work: Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Congresswoman Gwen Moore, Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett.,1
It goes back to the Arkansas days, and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors.,0
And I want to give a special shout out to Congresswoman Joyce Beatty.,1
But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business ... or, more accurately, their crime enterprise ... grew with the roles reversed.,0
Bill, now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator, Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President.,0
When I saw Joyce recently, she said, 'Well, you are coming, aren't you?',1
And I said, 'I'm working hard to get it set.',1
They turned this into an exponentially larger business.,0
But it was more than a business, it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise.,0
It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States.,0
And I am so proud that it did work out, and I thank Joyce for that extra push.,1
I also want to acknowledge someone who had such a profound effect on my life, in every way, someone whom I admire and love, Marian Wright Edelman.,1
This audience is filled with longtime friends and people I went to Wellesley College with that became life-long friends to me, and so many of you who have been on the front lines -- everyone associated with The Black Women's Agenda, I'm thrilled to be with you.,1
The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same.,0
If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton, you got an entry to the Department of State.,0
I'm thrilled to be associated with you.,1
Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s.,0
I'm also thrilled to be back on the campaign trail.,1
As the world knows, I was a little under the weather recently.,1
The good news is, my pneumonia finally got some Republicans interested in women's health.,1
Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills.,0
She was Secretary of State Clinton's Chief of Staff.,0
Looking back, I know, I should have followed my doctor's orders to rest, but, my instinct was to push through it.,1
That is what women do every single day, and I felt no different.,1
Life has shown us that we do have to work harder at the office while still bearing most of the responsibilities at home -- that we always need to keep going because our families and our communities count on us.,1
And I think it is more than fair to say, that black women have an even tougher road.,1
And you, your daughters, your granddaughters -- I was pleased to meet Gwen's beautiful granddaughter earlier -- leave the house every morning, put on that game face that we all practice, and enter a society that consistently challenges your worth.,1
You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business.,0
With the images you see, the lower pay that so many take home, that try to silence your voices and break your spirits; yet, you remain fierce in the face of these challenges.,1
But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation ... no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages.,0
We see that every day in the businesses you start, the art you create, the children you teach and the communities and organizations you lead.,1
While your stories are often missing from the history books -- make no mistake -- you are the change makers, the path breakers, and the ground shakers.,1
We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation.,0
And, you are proof that yes, indeed, black girl magic is real. ,1
Now, I've been blessed to see this magic's influence on kids and communities up close for decades, starting with my first job after law school working with Marian at the Children's Defense Fund.,1
This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case.,0
Marian's belief was that every single child had worth and potential and deserved the opportunity to live up to their god potential with the tools and the support that every child needs.,1
In other words, they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise.,0
The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech.,0
And that if we just improve the odds a bit for those suffering in poverty, they could flourish.,1
So she led our team into some very poor communities.,1
I walked through two of them yesterday ... the sale of U.S.,0
We met kids who had dropped out of school because they couldn't afford textbooks or transportation.,1
Some didn't have decent clothes and stayed home to avoid being humiliated in class.,1
Some had untreated medical and dental problems that made it practically impossible for them to learn.,1
Those stories really hurt my heart.,1
Uranium to Russia, and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech.,0
The UBS saga is another one.,0
Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans.,0
But Marian always believed we could deliver help and hope if we never ever gave up.,1
She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement.,0
Of the 52,000 accounts the U.S. was seeking, the government settled for only 4,450 accounts.,0
Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual.,0
Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60,000 to the Foundation.,0
After the Clinton favor for UBS, it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600,000 contribution, a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton.,0
This is corruption, pure and simple.,0
This is why I have called for a special prosecutor.,0
So she taught us ways to think creatively, as well as strategically-- to take our advocacy and turn it into action and results.,1
She sent me to New Bedford, Massachusetts, to go door to door looking for children who weren't in school.,1
That was back before we had a legal requirement that every child, regardless of disability, deserved to get an education.,1
Justice is supposed to be blind.,0
I met a young girl in New Bedford and sat and talked with her on the small back porch of her house.,1
It's never supposed to be for sale.,0
She told me how badly she wanted to learn, but couldn't because schools weren't accessible or welcoming.,1
In the long-run, there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J. Trump.,0
So Marian had us get to work and change that.,1
We gathered evidence and built a coalition.,1
Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law.,0
We helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.,1
Come November, the American people will show her that she is not.,0
You will be voting for justice, fairness and equality.,0
Marian showed me that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.,1
You will also be voting for a more inclusive country, where no one is left out.,0
You need both understanding and action.,1
And there is no question, I'm here today because of her example.,1
I also want to recognize pioneers like Barbara Jordan and Shirley Chisholm, who sacrificed and struggled so that I and so many other women running for office could soar.,1
I'm here because of friends and colleagues, like Donna Brazile, Reverend Leah Daugherty and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge ... three black women who ran the Democratic National Convention in July.,1
It was a great four days.,1
It goes to show that black women deserve more than a seat at the table.,1
Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty.,0
Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1,000 under President Obama.,0
It's past time you had a fair chance to run the meeting.,1
The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent.,0
And let's be clear: I would not be the Demo-cratic nominee for President of the United States were it not for black women like all of you who made noise at the polls this year in support of our campaign -- who did surrogate events, went to barber shops and beauty salons and cafes, got on local radio and local TV to make the case.,1
Our pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation.,0
We've come far together. ,1
I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty.,0
And as I said yesterday in North Carolina, I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career all those years ago at the Children's Defense Fund, and the way that I will serve as your president should I have the great honor of being elected: I will be focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families.,1
The American people deserve something to vote for, not just against. ,1
And together -- together, we are going to make this a freer, fairer and stronger nation.,1
We're going to fight for the parents struggling to balance family and work and push for affordable child care, paid family leave, and yes, finally, equal pay for women.,1
We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees communities of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.,0
The era of division is coming to end.,0
We will create a new future of American unity.,0
Are you ready for real American change?,0
It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans.,0
We'll fight for the young girls who want a fair chance in life, which is why we'll make universal pre-k available so that every child -- no matter what they look like or where they live -- can rise up and be prepared to fulfill their academic destiny.,1
We will promote our common culture, values and principles.,0
We are also going to do a lot to emphasize STEM education, particularly for girls and women, and I thank the agenda for making that a priority!,1
We'll fight for the entrepreneur who said that more businesses die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else, which is why we're going to increase access to capital, and we are going to help African American women continue to represent the fastest growing segment of women-owned businesses in America right now.,1
We will be one nation.,0
We are going to invest in communities that have been left out and left behind.,1
We will be one people.,0
Urban reinvestment and restructuring that is going to give more people decent housing, access to jobs, the transportation to get to those jobs, rural communities that are too often ignored and denied the services they need.,1
We will share together one great future.,0
I am a fan of Jim Clyburn's '10-20-30' plan.,1
It's going to be America First.,0
Together, we will make America proud again.,0
We will make America prosperous again.,0
I am going to do everything I can to push that forward.,1
We'll remember the pain of the Mothers of the Movement and fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and a future where everyone has respect for the law and is respected by the law.,1
And we are going to pass common-sense reforms to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people and keep our communities safe. ,1
We'll remember the families neglected in Flint and take action so that no child's life is ever put at risk again when brushing their teeth or drinking a glass of water at din-ner.,1
We'll advocate for everyone concerned about their parents and grandparents as they age, and lift up caregivers and home care workers so older Americans can live in comfort and with dignity. ,1
And we're going to protect and enhance Social Security, which is the main source of income for older women.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
We'll stand-by-side to make sure that all of our rights are respected and protected ... civil rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, worker's rights and, of course, voting rights.,1
We are coming together at a pivotal moment for our country.,1
Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again.,0
Now I do believe that every election is important.,1
But this one feels different, doesn't it?,1
That's because it is.,1
We want to achieve a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground.,0
I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing America's core national interests, promoting regional stability, and producing an easing of tensions in the world.,0
This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past.,0
We can make new friends, rebuild old alliances, and bring new allies into the fold.,0
The next 53 days will shape the next 50 years.,1
The future of our children and grandchildren hangs in the balance. ,1
I'm proud to have the support of warfighting generals, active duty military, and the top experts who know both how to win ... and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now.,0
On one hand, we have my opponent, Donald Trump, and in recent weeks, he's tried to restrain himself and clean up his image.,1
Just yesterday, 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign.,0
In a Trump Administration, our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism.,0
But as Maya Angelou once said, 'When some-one shows you who they are, believe them the first time.',1
And we know who Donald is.,1
The current strategy of toppling regimes, with no plan for what to do the day after, only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists.,0
Gradual reform, not sudden and radical change, should be our guiding objective in that region.,0
We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism, and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission.,0
For five years, he has led the birther movement to de-legitimize our first black president.,1
We now have an Administration, and a former Secretary of State, who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
His campaign was founded on this outrageous lie.,1
There is no erasing it in history.,1
Just yesterday, Trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the United States.,1
Donald's advisors had the temerity to say, 'He's doing the country a 'service' by pushing these lies.',1
No, he isn't.,1
Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS.,0
This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare ... as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago.,0
He's feeding into the worst im-pulses -- the bigotry and bias -- that lurks in our country.,1
Instead of an apology tour, I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world ... just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War.,0
We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American.,0
Barack Obama was born in America, plain and simple.,1
And Donald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.,1
So, my friends, there is no 'new' Donald Trump.,1
There never will be.,1
At the same time, immigration security is a vital part of our national security.,0
We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people.,0
Donald Trump looks at President Obama after eight years as our president.,1
He still doesn't see him as an American. ,1
Think of how dangerous that is.,1
Imagine a person in the Oval Office who traffics in conspiracy theories and refuses to let them go ... no matter what the facts are.,1
These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy.,0
Imagine someone who distorts the truth to fit a very narrow view of the world.,1
Imagine a president who sees someone who doesn't look like him, and doesn't agree with him, and thinks, 'That person must not be a real American.',1
Unlike my opponent, my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy, not destruction.,0
Hillary Clinton's legacy in Iraq, Libya, and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering.,0
Donald Trump is unfit to be President of the United States.,1
Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people, then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them.,0
Including Veteran healthcare costs, the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.,0
We cannot become insensitive to what he says and what he stirs up.,1
We can't just accept this.We've got to stand up to it.,1
Yet, after all this money spent and lives lost, Clinton's policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before.,0
Meanwhile, China has grown more aggressive, and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent.,0
Russia has defied this Administration at every turn.,0
Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton.,0
If we don't, it won't stop. ,1
In addition to the president, Donald Trump looks at a distinguished federal judge, born in Indiana, and he sees a Mexican, not an American.,1
Sometimes it has seemed like there wasn't a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didn't want to invade, intervene or topple.,0
He looks at a Gold Star family and sees them as Muslims, not patriotic Americans.,1
He looks at women and decides how our looks rate on a scale of one to 10.,1
She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war.,0
Hillary Clinton is just reckless ... so reckless, in fact, she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack.,0
I look at America, I see everyone.,1
Then Clinton's team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails.,0
I see our great diversity, which is one of our core strengths, not our burden.,1
They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones, to cover her tracks and obstruct justice.,0
These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over.,0
We know who Donald Trump is.,1
In the FBI report, she claimed she couldn't recall important information on 39 occasions.,0
She can't even remember whether she was trained in classified information, and said she didn't even know the letter "C" means confidential.,0
Now it's time for our country to show who we are and reject his divisive vision.,1
That's why this election is so important.,1
If she can't remember such crucial events and information, she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief.,0
Her conduct is simply disqualifying.,0
As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic Convention, 'When we go to the polls this November, the real choice isn't between a Democrat or Republican.',1
It's about who will have the power to shape our children's lives for the next four years.,1
It's also about the kind of country we want to be, and what we want to leave behind for future generations. ,1
She talks about her experience, but Hillary Clinton's only foreign policy experience is "failure.",0
We are at our best when every person gets to share in our nation's promise, contribute to its progress.,1
'Stronger Together' is not just our campaign slogan.,1
It's the guiding principle for the future we need to build.,1
So Americans, we need to ask themselves: Are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just for those at the top?,1
Everywhere she got involved, things got worse.,0
Let's look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in.,0
Libya was stable.,0
Syria was under control.,0
Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart?,1
Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States.,0
Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence.,0
Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything that generations of Americans have worked so hard to build? ,1
Now in many ways, the profound choice is up to the women in this room.,1
African American women turned out to vote more than any other group of Americans in 2012.,1
This year, once again, you have your hands on the wheel of history and you can write the next chapter of the American story. ,1
Keep up the great work with your Four for 4' campaign.,1
The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished.,0
Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.,0
Make sure we get as many people registered and then to the polls as we possibly can.,1
People say to me all time, 'I just -- I don't know what to do about Trump and his supporters and the things he says and inciting violence and all of the terrible activities that are happening this election year.',1
Fast-forward to today.,0
What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced?,0
Well, here's what we can do.,1
Let's reject the cynicism, the bullying, the divisive rhetoric that my opponent uses to make us afraid of each other, afraid of our differences, afraid of our future.,1
Libya is in ruins, our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, and ISIS has gained a new base of operations.,0
I know that all of us in this room are ready to stand up against this ... to rise up for our families, our communities, but most importantly, to show up at the polls this November.,1
With our power and strength, I know -- I believe this, or I would not be standing here before you, I would not have run again for president, I would not deal with all the in-coming brickbats that are hurled my way if I did not in my heart believe with every fiber of my being that together we can build a future where, yes, love trumps hate.,1
Thank you very much.,1
Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war.,0
Thank you.",1
And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had, Barack Obama?,1
All through this campaign, I have made the point over and over again, Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression.,1
ISIS controls large portions of territory.,0
He brought Osama bin Laden to justice.,1
And so much more.,1
I, for one, don't think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what he's done on behalf of our country and the world.,1
And it's not just the President he's been, but the man he is.,1
Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters, have represented our country with class, grace, and integrity.,1
As Michelle says, 'When others go low, we go high.',1
I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you're a great American!,1
And you make us all proud to be Americans, too.,1
Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor, and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well.,1
I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps ... Barbara Jordan.,1
Shirley Chisholm.,1
A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.,0
I would not be standing here without them.,1
And hundreds of thousands are dead.,0
In Egypt, terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert, near the Suez Canal, one of the most essential waterways in the world.,0
Iraq is in chaos, and ISIS is on the loose.,0
ISIS has spread across the Middle East, and into the West.,0
Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States ... plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments.,0
In other words, our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money.,0
Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us.,1
Worst of all, the Nuclear deal puts Iran, the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism, on a path to nuclear weapons.,0
This is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.,0
But that's not all.,0
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military, which only invite more aggression from our adversaries.,0
This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back, to leaders like all of you, and to a rising generation of young activists.,1
To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America, every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential.,1
This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund all those years ago.,1
And I'm going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president, focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families.,1
History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest.,0
We have so much work to do together.,1
I've heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign.,1
We want to deter, avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength.,0
One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner, a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia.,1
Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II.,0
She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job.,1
She said she'd been hungry more times than she could count, and that life felt like a maze, because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned.,1
We currently have the smallest Army since 1940.,0
The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915.,0
But despite all of this, Tianna has hope.,1
She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day.,1
And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family.,1
And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947.,0
Let's prove her right.,1
As a country, we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams.,1
When Ronald Reagan left office, our Navy had 592 ships.,0
When Barack Obama took office, it had 285 ships.,0
That is what's at stake in this election.,1
Today, the Navy has just 276 ships.,0
The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old.,0
We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers ... their fathers flew the same plane.,0
It's not about golf course promotions or birth certificate.,1
Our Army has been shrinking rapidly, from 553,000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479,000 today.,0
In 2009, our Marine Corps had 202,000 active Marines.,0
Today, it's just 182,000.,0
It comes down to,1
Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions.,0
President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450,000 troops...which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States.,0
who will fight for the forgotten, who will invest in our children, and who will really have your back in the White House.,1
We need ideas, not insults, real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind, not prejudice and paranoia.,1
It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system.,0
We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards.,1
In 2010, the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending.,0
Instead, we need to come together, to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage, to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburn's 10-20-30 plan, to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people, to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice, and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in.,1
When you really think about it, the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans.,1
As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention, it's about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives.,1
In the current year, we are spending $548 billion ... a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars.,0
This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester, or automatic defense budget cuts.,0
Under the budget agreement, defense took half of the cuts ... even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget.,0
As soon as I take office, I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military.,0
This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding, and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs.,0
It's also about the kind of country we want to be, what we want to leave behind for future generations.,1
As part of removing the defense sequester, I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending.,0
I thank everyone here, who has been fighting for this vision over so many years.,1
In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public.,0
I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks ... and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans.,0
Government-wide, improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year, and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion.,0
We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition ... that is, when employees retire, they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees.,0
We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law.,0
I thank all who have supported me.,1
I want you to know I'm not taking your vote or anyone's vote for granted.,1
Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws.,0
I'm working every single day to earn your support.,1
And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together.,1
Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation.,1
So to everyone here tonight, please, keep doing what you're doing, but also help to register voters.,1
Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years.,0
Tell others about the clear choice in this election.,1
The military will not be exempt either ... the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well.,0
In some states, early voting is nearly here, so we need to keep the pressure on.,1
Let's send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together.,1
Early in my term, I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills, which many are not doing right now.,0
Only 5 NATO countries, including the United States, are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense.,0
And no matter what, remember this: Love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all very much!",1
Before I begin with my remarks, I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York, New Jersey and Minnesota.,1
There are now reports of a suspect in custody, but we must remain vigilant.,1
Additionally, I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them.,0
Finally, we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy.,0
The Institute for Energy Research cites a "short-run" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production.,0
Using these new funds, I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals:,0
We will build an active Army of around 540,000, as the Army's chief of staff has said he needs.,0
This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world.,1
We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams, or 490,000 troops, and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready.,0
We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions, which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies ... we have 23 now.,0
I'm here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really, much more than that, they are part of our future ... the kind of country we want to have, the kind of people we want to be and, particularly, what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America.,1
We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines, as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel ... we have 276 ships now.,0
I have a proud Owl on my staff, Jamira Burley.,1
And we will build an Air Force of at least 1,200 fighter aircraft, which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions ... we have 1,113 now.,0
We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system.,0
A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia.,1
She loves Temple and we love her.,1
And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction.,1
Under Obama-Clinton, our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea.,0
Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future.,1
As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs, US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East, as well as our allies, are increasingly in range, with the United States homeland also potentially threatened.,0
We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense, starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.,0
The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service, then refused to modernize these aging ships.,0
We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships.,0
Your generation is the most inclusive, progressive and entrepreneurial that we've ever seen.,1
As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.,0
Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort ...every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow.,0
In addition, we will improve the Department of Defense's cyber capabilities.,0
And as you heard, when Lauren was in college, she saw challenges facing students of color, but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus ... so she started one.,1
And Lauren remains committed and engaged, working with an organization called Generation Progress, because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades.,1
Now, I know that with so much negativity out there, it is really easy to get cynical ... especially about our politics.,1
I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War.,1
It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothing's ever going to change.,1
But you're here today because you refuse to accept cynicism.,1
You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years.,1
Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking.,0
And you see how much needs fixing in our country, from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change ... but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together.,1
Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules, and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information.,0
You're here today because you believe we can do just that.,1
You want something to vote for, not just against.,1
Optimism, not resentment.,1
Answers, not anger.,1
Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department.,0
Ideas, not insults.,1
Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale.,0
Bridges, not walls.,1
We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S. Cyber Command, and recruit the best and brightest Americans.,0
You're also here because you know this election isn't a reality TV show.,1
One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and all relevant federal departments, to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities ... in our power grid, our communications systems, and all vital infrastructure.,0
It shouldn't be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news.,1
I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities.,0
At the same time, we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies, including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications.,0
This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America.,1
I believe it's wrong to tear each down.,1
These new investments in cybersecurity, and the modernization of our military, will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow.,0
We should be lifting each other up.,1
It's wrong to let income inequality get even worse.,1
America must be the world's dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century, and young Americans ... including in our inner cities ... should get these new jobs.,0
We have to make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We must also ensure that we have the best medical care, education and support for our military service members and their families ... both when they serve, and when they return to civilian life.,0
Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal.,0
And it's wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war.,1
To all those who have served this nation, I say: I will never let you down.,0
We will protect those who protect us.,0
We should work with our allies to keep us safe.,1
It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country, or are we going to be, as I know we can, stronger together?,1
I know what I believe, and I'm going to close my campaign the same way I started my career ... fighting for kids and young people and families.,1
That has been the cause of my life.,1
And we will follow their example of unity.,0
We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation.,0
And it will be the passion of my presidency, and I hope you'll join me.,1
Together, we will have one great American future.,0
We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.,0
We can't get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus.,1
My husband has a saying about that.,1
America will be a prosperous, generous and inclusive society.,0
He calls it majoring in the minors ... getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesn't matter, you forget what's really important to your future and to the future of this country.,1
Take the challenges facing young Americans today.,1
We will discard the failed policies and division of the past, and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy, rebuild our inner cities, and rebuild our country.,0
We will bring back our jobs.,0
We will make America strong again.,0
First of all, if you're willing to work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world.,1
But that's been out of reach for too many young people ... trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
And we will make America great again.,0
Our vision of hope stands in stark contrast to my opponent's campaign of hate.,0
That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs.,1
Hillary Clinton has been running a hate-filled and negative campaign with no policy, no solutions, and no new ideas.,0
We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner, more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country.,1
Next, getting an education should give you a boost, not hold you back.,1
But as you know better than most, tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up.,1
By contrast, I've been going around the country offering detailed plans for reform.,0
I understand that Temple was founded to democratize, diversify and widen the reach of higher education.,1
All of these reform plans are available on our website.,0
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.,0
You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders.,0
That is still a vital goal.,1
So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan.,1
We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone.,1
You are Democrats, Independents and Republicans.,0
Above all else, you are Americans ... and you are entitled to leadership that honors you, cherishes you and defends you.,0
And if you already have debt, we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford.,1
Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country.,0
You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com.,1
Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your champion in the White House.,0
Hillary Clinton represents only the insiders, the donors and the special interests.,0
And here's something we don't talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America.,1
I will be speaking more about Hillary Clinton's disqualifying remarks in a minute, but first let me invite onto the stage some people who can tell you themselves what they think of her spiteful comments.,0
People should be able to learn a skill, practice a trade, and making a good living because of that.,1
I have some more thoughts on Clinton's remarks I will be sharing momentarily, but first I want to tell you what I am going to do to make your life better.,0
So we're offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board ... for welders, machinists, health technicians, coders, and so many other fields.,1
We've outlined a detailed plan on trade, on immigration, on rebuilding the military, on changing our foreign policy.,0
Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in today's economy.,1
I've delivered a plan on defeating Islamic terrorism, on reforming our tax code, on unleashing American energy, and on providing school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.,0
We've released policy after policy, solution after solution.,0
Families look different today than they did decades ago, I think we can all agree.,1
Most need two incomes just to get by.,1
And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules, or they have to cobble together part-time work, all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country.,1
That's why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality, affordable childcare, preschool and paid family leave.,1
Every day, we are putting forward new ideas to make your life better.,0
We fundamentally believe ... the more we can strengthen families, the stronger we will be as a nation.,1
Everywhere I go, young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today.,1
You aren't ... and you shouldn't be ... satisfied with the progress we've made.,1
You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all.,1
We see, as Lauren said, too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home.,1
And more than previous generations, you understand that all these challenges are intersecting, and we must take them on together.,1
But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like we've never seen before in any campaign.,1
The change will start right away, the moment I take my oath of office.,0
Hate speech being normalized.,1
On my first day, we are going to immediately terminate every single unconstitutional executive order signed by President Obama.,0
The dog whistles are out in the open.,1
Then, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight ,0
years.,0
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.,0
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.,0
And yet, despite this, I remain convinced America's best days are ahead of us.,1
In large part, that's because of the inspiring young people I meet every day.,1
I'm inspired by Astrid.,1
I met her in Las Vegas last summer.,1
She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll, a cross, and the dress she was wearing.,1
Now she's in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform.,1
We should all join her in this.,1
I'm inspired by Mikey, who I met in New York.,1
We are going to lift the restriction on American energy ... this will create another half a million new jobs a year.,0
That's just the beginning.,0
Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense.,1
After he got out, Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people who've done their time to find good jobs and opportunities.,1
On my first day in office, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare ... this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.,0
I am also going to propose a massive tax reduction to unleash prosperity in every city and state in our country.,0
But he persisted, and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York ... and I can recommend, it's delicious.,1
We have to do more to help others get that second chance, including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system.,1
On that first day, I am also going to instruct the Department of Commerce to immediately begin a review of all foreign trade practices that unfairly hurt American manufacturing.,0
I will use every lawful Presidential power to achieve relief for our workers.,0
You can read the full 7-point trade plan on my website, DonaldJTrump.com.,0
North Carolina has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.,0
Bill Clinton signed it, and Hillary Clinton supported it.,0
Right here in Ashville, you've lost 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization ... another Hillary-backed deal.,0
I'm inspired by Erica, one of the bravest young women I've ever met.,1
Hillary Clinton owes all of you an apology.,0
Her mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students.,1
Erica was devastated.,1
But then, she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms.,1
It's been painful for her ... a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful ... but Erica won't give up.,1
As she said, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, it's hard, so I'm going to walk away?,1
And I think you'll get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton hands over the 33,000 emails she deleted.,0
That's not the type of world I want to live in.',1
That's the spirit that makes this country great ... we might get knocked down, but we get right back up again.,1
And we refuse to quit, no matter what.,1
And that's the spirit we need in this election too.,1
Now, I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship, the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm.,1
By the way, Hillary Clinton destroyed her emails after she received a congressional subpoena.,0
They used a special software called bleach bit.,0
She even made her 13 different phones disappear ... some of them were even destroyed with a hammer.,0
Hillary Clinton obviously had a whole lot to hide, including her pay-for-play scandals at Secretary of State.,0
Pay-for-play with UBS, with Russian Uranium, with contracts for her friends and family ,0
I also know that even if you're totally opposed to Donald Trump, you may still have some questions about me.,1
in Haiti.,0
Nothing is so dangerous to American Democracy as when a public official puts their federal office up for sale.,0
I get that.,1
And I want to do my best to answer those questions.,1
Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law.,0
She also believes that she is above all of you.,0
After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton came out and finally told the world how she feels about the people of this country.,0
She said tens of millions of patriotic Americans belong in a "basket of deplorables.",0
When it comes to public service, the 'service' part has always easier for me than the 'public' part.,1
She talks about people like they're objects, not human beings.,0
I will never be the showman my opponent is ... and you know what, that's okay with me.,1
And it's also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy, like the precise interest rate on your student loans, right down to the decimal.,1
She said half of our supporters are not even real Americans, and describes the other half as having run out of options ... what she can't understand or accept is that the great majority of this country now sees right through the lies and deceptions of a failed political establishment.,0
They want change, they want justice, and they want a government that puts the American people first.,0
But that's because it's not a detail for you.,1
Whether our supporters have lost a job to a factory moved to another country, or whether they're a captain in the police department, or a teacher at a local school, they are united by their deep and sophisticated understanding of how our political system has abandoned the people.,0
For those who have been hit by hard times, they understand better than anyone that it's Hillary Clinton's Wall Street agenda that has crushed the middle class of this country.,0
Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred in her heart for these working class Americans.,0
She looks down on them ... she looks down on all the people who make her life possible.,0
She looks down on the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, lawyers and accountants.,0
It's a big deal.,1
She looks down on the police officers, soldiers, and firefighters supporting our campaign.,0
And it should be a big deal to your president.,1
So here's what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing.,1
Hold us accountable for our ideas, both of us.,1
She looks down on the people who cook her meals, drive her cars, and dig the coal that powers her electricity.,0
I can't promise you'll agree with me all the time, but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better.,1
She called these Americans every name in the book ... racist, sexist, xenophobic, Islamophobic ... she said they were not even American.,0
I will never stop, no matter how tough it gets.,1
Never in history has a major-party presidential candidate so viciously demonized the American voter.,0
She was attacking millions of moms and dads who love their children and want a better future for all Americans.,0
What should these parents tell their children about Hillary Clinton's attacks?,0
To every kid in America tonight, I want you to know: your parents are working so hard to make your life better, and to make your country better ... and if I get the chance, I will fight right alongside them to deliver a better future for everyone.,0
In fact, you can read about what Tim and I want to do.,1
We're not keeping it a secret.,1
We've got a book called 'Stronger Together.',1
But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president.,1
I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice, activism, and public service.,1
Clinton made her remarks at a high-dollar fundraiser in Wall Street.,0
The first woman is my mother.,1
Her name was Dorothy, and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl.,1
She ended up out on her own at 14, working as a housemaid.,1
When I learned about this many years later, I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm, loving person and not become bitter and broken.,1
And here's what she said, one word: 'kindness.',1
Her goal is simple: to bully the American voter out of voting for change.,0
She was saved by the kindness of others.,1
Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share.,1
The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone.,1
The people who rigged the system want to keep things exactly as they are.,0
We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.,1
She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can.,1
They want to keep our terrible trade deals.,0
They want to trap children in failing government schools.,0
That mission guides me still today.,1
When I stumble, it helps pick me up, because there's always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open, especially kids.,1
They want massive regulation to keep small businesses from being able to compete.,0
Hillary Clinton can never be President of this country.,0
When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported, it hit me right in the gut.,1
No one who has such a low opinion of the American people can ever be elected as their President.,0
Earlier today I had a chance to spend some time with some more of our most amazing Americans.,0
I spent the afternoon with the National Guard Association of the United States.,0
These are the heroes who rescue our people in disasters, and who fight our wars.,0
I knew how hard-working her parents were.,1
I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life.,1
When I met a little boy in Flint, Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead, it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder.,1
Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America.,1
These heroes are a permanent testament to the courage and character of our nation.,0
We also honor and remember the lives of the service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice.,0
The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman.,1
There is no greater love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for this country and its people.,0
She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi, first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar.,1
Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting.,0
She was an ally of Dr. King and Robert Kennedy, and the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, an altogether remarkable person.,1
One day during my first semester in law school, I saw a flyer ... we used to have those, flyers on a campus bulletin board.,1
And Marian was coming to give a lecture.,1
One thing that we must do is to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the best equipment, resources and tools in the world.,0
We must provide them the best medical care while they serve, and the best medical care when they return home to civilian life.,0
The Veterans scandals that have occurred under this Administration ... and that have been dismissed by my opponent ... are a permanent stain on this government.,0
It's just one more way Hillary Clinton only looks out for herself.,0
We must take care of our Veterans.,0
I made sure to be there, and what I heard was captivating.,1
That includes giving Veterans the right to choose treatment at either a public VA facility, or the private doctor of their choice.,0
Just today we learned that the VA has violated a federal law by failing to make its ,0
Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families.,1
performance records available to consumers.,0
Something just clicked in my brain.,1
The scandals never seem to end ... but they will, when I'm elected President.,0
Nothing makes me more proud than to have the support of the men and women who hear the uniform.,0
We've received endorsements from 120 generals and admirals, these are the people who know how to keep our country safe.,0
I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others I'd learned from my mother, my church, into real social change.,1
I went up to her and I said, 'Could I work for you this summer?',1
Just today, I was profoundly humbled to gain the endorsement of 13 Medal of Honor recipients.,0
I can't even begin to say how much it means to me to have the support of these intrepid heroes.,0
She said, 'Sure, but I can't pay you.',1
Also, today, I was thrilled to announce that Ambassador R. James Woolsey, former head of the CIA, is now a senior advisor to our campaign.,0
I said, 'Well, I am paying my way through law school, so I have to get paid.',1
She said, 'Well, if you can figure out how to get paid, you can have a job.',1
So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her.,1
After graduation, I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm, but I went to work for Marian at the Children's Defense Fund instead.,1
We are on a mission of change.,0
That includes a new agenda for our inner cities.,0
She sent me door to door in New Bedford, Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then.,1
And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house.,1
She told me how badly she wanted an education, but it just didn't seem possible.,1
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.,0
My heart went out to her and I wanted to help.,1
4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.,0
But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough.,1
That wouldn't force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education.,1
I learned that to drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws.,1
So we gathered evidence.,1
2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
We built a coalition.,1
For those suffering and hurting, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance.,0
I will fix it.,0
What do you have to lose?,0
Let me also tell you what you have to gain: millions of new jobs, higher wages, and amazing schools.,0
And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.,1
And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families.,1
I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies.,1
In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies.,1
I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
When Bill was elected President, a lot of people were surprised, and even threatened, by the idea of an activist as First Lady.,1
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.,0
In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans ... and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.,0
But I wasn't about to quit then, either.,1
I fought for universal health care, and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids today. ,1
We will keep our children safe ... which includes steadfast support for American law enforcement.,0
The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia, the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City.,1
It was the late 1990s, and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate, and I kept telling them no.,1
After all, no First Lady had ever done anything like that.,1
I myself hadn't run for anything since student council.,1
Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
Government corruption will end.,0
Honesty will be restored.,0
Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.,0
I'd always been an advocate, not a politician.,1
We will make America prosperous again.,0
But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King.,1
Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said, 'Dare to compete.',1
We will make America safe again.,0
Before my speech, Sophia introduced me.,1
She was tall, and as we shook hands, she bent over and whispered in my ear, 'Dare to compete, Mrs. Clinton.,1
And will Make America great again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
In 39 days, we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House.,0
Dare to compete.',1
It is going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.,0
We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs, your wealth, and your middle class.,0
Once again, something just clicked.,1
We are going to take on the arrogant, corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity ... a theft that has left behind crumbling schools, roads, bridges and a ,0
For years I had been telling young women to step up.,1
Participate.,1
depleted military.,0
It is time to rebuild Detroit.,0
Go for what you believe in.,1
Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?,1
Well, it was a difficult transition, becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race.,1
Even all these years later, I confess I don't enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians, like talking about myself.,1
But I took that leap then for the same reason I'm running now, to even the odds for those who've got the odds stacked against them, especially children and families.,1
It is time to rebuild Michigan.,0
It is time to rebuild the United States of America.,0
And I've learned that in a democracy, if you want to help the greatest number of people, you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out.,1
We need activists and advocates, entrepreneurs and innovators, teachers and mentors, people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways.,1
Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan.,0
We also need strong, principled leaders who can win votes, write laws, allocate resources, and do the slow, hard business of governing.,1
Now, of course, politics can be discouraging.,1
This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes.,1
But it matters.,1
These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit.,0
That's how she gets rich ... by taking your jobs and your money away from you.,0
That's why Hillary Clinton, if she ever got the chance, would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
It really does.,1
The deal she called the "Gold Standard.",0
The TPP will economically devastate Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and so many other states across this country.,0
It matters for our families, our communities, and our country and the world.,1
Hillary Clinton's donors want the TPP ... and their wish is her command.,0
These special interests pay her for speeches.,0
They pay her Foundation.,0
They pay her husband.,0
Our most cherished values are at stake.,1
Every election is important, from school board to state senate to president.,1
In return, they GET YOUR JOBS.,0
But this time is different.,1
We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses, who retweets white supremacists, who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President, and he's still lying about it today.,1
Like I've been saying all week, when it comes to Hillary Clinton, all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY.,0
He refuses to apologize to President Obama, his family, and the American people.,1
Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions.,0
Her close associate and confidant, Terry McAuliffe, said she'd pass it.,0
We have to stand up to this hate.,1
Her husband has talked it up.,0
We cannot let it go on.,1
And when we do that, we send a clear message: America is better than this.,1
Everyone knows she's for it, because she doesn't believe in protecting American Sovereignty.,0
America is better than Donald Trump.,1
Just as important, we have a chance to make real progress together in our country.,1
I need you.,1
Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors.,0
I need you as partners, not just for winning this election, but for driving real change over the next four years.,1
The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election, one president, or even one generation.,1
It's going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want.,1
That's why, if I'm in the White House, young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made.,1
Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP, 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation.,0
9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches.,0
So if you believe diversity is America's strength, not America's burden, join us.,1
Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP, 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation.,0
At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800,000 for her campaign.,0
On November 8th, We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long, long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST.,0
If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us.,1
If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs, join us.,1
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.,0
If you believe that every man, woman, and child in America has the right to affordable, quality health care, join us.,1
If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women, join us.,1
And here's how you can join us.,1
Go to iwillvote.com and register today.,1
I am an outsider fighting for you.,0
Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system.,0
We are the ones who are going to change the system so it's fair and just for every American.,0
We have a movement.,0
Register your friends.,1
Register everyone you know.,1
This is going to be close.,1
The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us.,0
The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige.,0
We need everyone off the sidelines.,1
Not voting is not an option.,1
That just plays into Trump's hands.,1
The arrogant political class doesn't believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans.,0
They don't believe in secure borders and strong walls.,0
It really does.,1
Text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246 right now, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
I understand here at Temple you're already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it.,1
We have 50 days, 50 days, to reach everybody we possibly can, to not only win an election ... that's just the first step ... then to keep the progress going, go even further, make it absolutely clear that we're going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are.,1
These Washington and Wall Street insiders don't believe in hiring more police, producing more American energy, or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools.,0
So talk to your classmates.,1
Talk to your neighbors.,1
Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia.,1
You know, I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced.,1
Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14, it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other, where the parents loved their children, cared for them, planned for them, where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers.,1
For decades, we've talked about the corruption, incompetence, and failures of our leaders.,0
2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem ... and to hold our politicians accountable.,0
If you do this one simple thing, you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote.,0
Everything I've learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate. ,1
So please join us in working together.,1
When you cast that ballot, just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry, and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: you're fired.,0
In their place, will be a new government.,0
We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln, and once again, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
There's no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group.,1
We are going to do it together.,0
In 39 days, everything is going to change.,0
And when you turn out and vote this fall, we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome.,1
Now, the media doesn't want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption.,0
So we are going to spell it out for them today.,0
We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential, no matter who they are, where they're from, what they look like, or who they love.,1
That's the America we believe in.,1
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
That's the America worth fighting for.,1
That's what we've got to do to stand together.,1
We are stronger together, and let's make sure love trumps hate.,1
Follow the money.,0
Thank you all!",1
I want to thank Anastasia for that introduction.,1
Didn't she do an amazing job?,1
I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old.,1
She raised her hand at a town hall and she said, 'My twin sister can't speak.,1
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
Follow the money.,0
Because of that, they put her in a separate class, apart from the rest of the kids.,1
But she can communicate with a computer.,1
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
Follow the money.,0
The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
Follow the money.,0
In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.,0
She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.,0
And she's very smart and would do just as well as anyone else, if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance.',1
I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl ... her confidence and how much she loved her sister.,1
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.,0
So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years.,1
When she grew up, she became an intern in the Senate.,1
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.,0
Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.,0
She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale ... and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.,0
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.,0
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.,0
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.,0
I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too.,1
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.,0
We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five.,0
And I'm very excited that she's here with us today.,1
So here's my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?,0
I also want to thank Orlando.,1
And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge, here and now, not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself?,0
No one is above the law.,0
Not even Hillary Clinton.,0
Clinton and her cronies will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on ,0
It's great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you.,1
power ... to keep their control over this country.,0
Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich, in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money?,0
You've been through a lot this year.,1
And what has been so notable is you've responded with grace.,1
The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals.,0
You've shown the world what Orlando is made of ... strength, love and kindness.,1
This is something we could all use more of right now.,1
I'm here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone, but first, I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days.,1
They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.,0
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.,0
First, an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa.,1
Then, a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte.,1
I'm sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well.,1
There is still much we don't know about what happened in both incidents.,1
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.,0
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton ... they are too smart, and they know they are being used.,0
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over ... she never does, and that will never change.,0
But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters.,1
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators.",0
To the African-American community, let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago?,0
If not, vote for Donald Trump.,0
It's unbearable.,1
I will bring jobs, great education, and safe neighborhoods.,0
And it needs to become intolerable.,1
If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting the same results.,0
We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week.,1
Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit.,0
And last night in Charlotte, 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scott's death.,1
Half of Detroit residents do not work.,0
Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty.,0
Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage, honor and skill.,1
We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota.,1
Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right.,1
It's the second most dangerous city in America, according to the FBI.,0
And they likely saved a lot of lives.,1
This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton.,0
I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed, as I am, to reform.,1
A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.,0
My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.,0
Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated.,0
Why?,1
Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers.,1
We will unleash the power of American energy.,0
The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.,0
We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities.,1
I've also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children, and young people who feel that, as far as their country's concerned, their lives seem disposable.,1
And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in Michigan, will be renegotiated ... and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing.,0
We've got to do better.,1
Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO ... both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
Before NAFTA went into effect, there were 280,000 auto workers in Michigan.,0
Today, that number is only 160,000.,0
Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico.,0
And I know we can.,1
It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.,0
And if I'm elected president, we will ... and we will do it exactly together, which is the only way it can be done.,1
Look, I know I don't have all the answers.,1
I don't know anyone who does.,1
But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.,1
Sybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine.,1
Her son, Trayvon Martin, was killed not far from where we are today.,1
Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.,0
Sybrina says, 'This is about saving our children.',1
Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, which has cost this country another 100,000 jobs.,0
And she's absolutely right.,1
We need to come together, work together ... white, black, Latino, Asian, all of us ... to turn the tide, stop the violence, build the trust.,1
We need to give all of our kids, no matter who they are, the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country.,1
Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007.,0
Now, there are so many issues we need to take on together, and that's why we're here today.,1
She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal "will hurt the us auto industry, increase our trade deficit, cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive.",0
Because in just 48 days ... can you believe it, 48 days ... Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president.,1
She pledged to reject the deal.,0
Well, I hope so.,1
I hope so.,1
But she lied to all of you, just like she lied about her emails.,0
I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that, in America, every person, no matter what you look like, who you are, who you love, you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you.,1
Once installed as Secretary of State, she supported it and called it a "cutting-edge deal.",0
She rammed it through to adoption ... she always does whatever the donors tell her to do, no matter how it impacts our families, schools and communities.,0
The U.S. trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose.,0
This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state.,0
And that is the basic bargain that made our country great, and it's our job to make sure it's there for you and future generations.,1
According to the Economic Policy Institute, Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members, and the country lost 740,000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year.,0
Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved, as Hillary Clinton is planning to do.,0
Building an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, is the central challenge of our time.,1
And I take it personally, because I'm a proud product of the American middle class.,1
My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton, Pennsylvania, when he was just a boy, and worked there for 50 years.,1
Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.,0
She even supports the disastrous surrender of America's control of the internet, which is happening tomorrow.,0
Thanks to him, my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business, printing fabric for draperies.,1
And because of my dad and my mom, I could head out into the world and follow my dreams.,1
Hillary Clinton's website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a "global community of stakeholders.",0
Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton it's not the job of our leaders to represent a "global community.",0
Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children.,1
It's the job of our leaders to represent American citizens.,0
Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country.,0
And history has shown us ... our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive, broad-based growth ... when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards.,1
Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people.,0
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
I am running to be President of the United States of America.,0
Now, here is just one example.,1
Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen?,0
The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth.,1
But as women's labor participation has slowed in recent years, due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare, so our economic growth wasn't as strong as it could have been.,1
Women who want to work deserve to work.,1
The reason for this is simple.,0
And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them ... and we all lose out.,1
In a competitive 21st century global economy, we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines.,1
When we leave people out or write them off, we not only shortchange them and their dreams, we shortchange our country and our own futures.,1
It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.,0
That's one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents.,1
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your ,0
family.,0
It's one reason why I'm such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform.,1
Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal.,0
Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation, and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base.,1
And, just today, we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released, the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Iran's missile programs.,0
It is estimated if we did this, despite what you hear from the other side, we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years.,1
Now, we need that.,1
It's also one reason why we've got to break down barriers of systemic racism, including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations.,1
Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.,0
That's part of building an inclusive economy, too.,1
And it's why I believe we need to do more to help young people, who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession, find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again.,1
And we've got to help older Americans who've displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy. ,1
And too often, training and retraining doesn't work as it should.,1
If you don't have a four-year degree, if you haven't really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years, it's hard to just make a course correction.,1
Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors ... we're taking them on for YOU.,0
So you can have the future you want.,0
Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs, starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers.,1
They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment.,0
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.,0
I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.,0
Whether you're trying to start your career or you've spent decades contributing to our economy, you deserve better.,1
Now, these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy, and I'm going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because we've actually put in one place all of our plans.,1
You see, we have this old-fashioned idea if we're asking you to support us, we should tell you what we're going to do.,1
Together, we can accomplish anything we want.,0
Right?,1
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.,0
You have 39 days until the election.,0
You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed ,0
for your country come true.,0
And today I want to focus on one area that hasn't gotten enough attention.,1
It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible, overlooked, and undervalued, who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it.,1
Now, that's been true for a long time, and we have to change it.,1
Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.,0
I'm talking about people with disabilities, men and women, boys and girls, who have talents, skills, ideas, and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else.,1
Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich, full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country.,1
And right now, in too many ways, we are falling short.,1
We've got to face that and do better for everyone's sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans.,1
I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency. ,1
I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people.,1
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.,0
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the ,0
American voter.,0
On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.,0
Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country:,0
We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
American cars ... made in Michigan ... will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known.,1
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability.,1
Now, some of those disabilities are highly visible, some much harder to notice.,1
If you don't know you know someone with a disability, I promise you, you do.,1
But their disability is just one part of who they are.,1
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.,0
Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones.,1
They're holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.,1
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
They're veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe.,1
They're working in the White House.,1
Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf.,1
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
So when world leaders come to the White House, the person who greets them is Leah.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone.,1
To the people of Michigan, I promise you this ...,0
And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns.,1
I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities, and they're doing phenomenal work.,1
We will make America wealthy again.,0
We will make America strong again.,0
I'm grateful to them every single day.,1
And people all over America would say the same about their boss, their colleague, their employee, their family member with a disability.,1
We will make America safe again.,0
And we will make America great again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
In 26 days, we are going to win the state, and we are going to win the White House.,0
Now, over the past few days, our country has taken leaps forward, not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities, but in making long-overdue changes in our schools, workplaces, and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life.,1
Even so, not that long ago if you had a disability ... if you couldn't see, couldn't walk, lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue ... that one fact was allowed to define your entire life.,1
Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American People.,0
Because of that and that alone, the world was closed to you.,1
There is nothing the political establishment will not do, and no lie they will not tell, to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense.,0
The Washington establishment, and the financial and media corporations that fund it, exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself.,0
The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election.,0
As an example, just one single trade deal they'd like to pass, involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries, corporations and lobbyists.,0
For those who control the levers of power in Washington, and for the global special interests they partner with, our campaign represents an existential threat.,0
This is not simply another 4-year election.,0
Not all of it and not for everyone, but for most people, basic essential things that others could do you couldn't and never would.,1
This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government.,0
The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us, is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration, and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry.,0
And that was that.,1
I saw this for myself, as Anastasia said, years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Children's Defense Fund.,1
The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs, as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries throughout the world.,0
One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids weren't in school.,1
We looked at census tract numbers and we said, okay.,1
How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract?,1
Then we would look at school enrollment numbers, and there'd be a gap.,1
And we would say, wait a minute.,1
Where are the kids?,1
Why aren't they in school?,1
I went door to door, along with people across our country, going into different communities.,1
Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic, and our gross domestic product, or GDP, is barely above one percent.,0
I was in New Bedford, Massachusetts.,1
We saw a notable disparity there, and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities.,1
Workers in the United States, were making less than they were almost 20 years ago ... and yet they are working harder.,0
It's a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth, and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.,0
There were kids who were hard of hearing, kids with intellectual disabilities.,1
Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan ... and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and across our country.,0
They have stripped these towns bare, and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.,0
I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart, curious, desperate to go to school.,1
The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure.,0
But that chair held her back.,1
Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms.,1
We've seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.,0
Most teachers and aides weren't trained to help her.,1
And, likewise, the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates.,0
So she didn't get to go.,1
It felt like the world had said to her, sorry, kid.,1
Your life just isn't going to be worth very much.,1
Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times.,0
And she and her family weren't rich.,1
And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election.,0
With their control over our government at stake, with trillions of dollars on the line, the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign, which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before ... and we won't let them do that.,0
The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media.,0
They weren't powerful.,1
Let's be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism.,0
So what could they do about it?,1
That little girl reminded me of another little girl, my mother.,1
They are a political special interest, no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda.,0
And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost, at any price, no matter how many lives they destroy.,0
She didn't face the same challenges, but she, too, was clocked from a full and happy childhood ... abandoned by her own parents, raised by grandparents who didn't want her, and ended up on her own when she was just 14, supporting herself as a housemaid.,1
But then something finally went her way.,1
For them, it is a war ... and for them, nothing is out of bounds.,0
This is a struggle for the survival of our nation.,0
This election will determine whether we are a free nation, or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system.,0
This is not just conspiracy but reality, and you and I know it.,0
The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known.,0
The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school.,1
Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe and morally deformed.,0
They will attack you, they will slander you, they will seek to destroy your career and reputation.,0
And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like.,1
And they will lie, lie and lie even more.,0
After many lonely years, it was the start of a better life.,1
The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone.,1
The Clintons are criminals.,0
This is well-documented, and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power.,0
Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this, one that includes the destruction of 33,000 emails, 13 phones, laptops, missing boxes of evidence, and on and on.,0
People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything.,0
And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine, the New York Times, and other media outlets, as part of a concerted, coordinated and vicious attack.,0
We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up.,1
And I remembered that, sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair.,1
It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment, and all together at the same time, as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine ... including 2,000 more emails this morning,0
These claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false ... and the Clinton Machine knows it is.,0
My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids.,1
It's all fabricated.,0
So we opened the doors to school, and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed, 26 years ago.,1
It was bipartisan.,1
It's pure fiction and outright lies.,0
These events never happened.,0
The claims are preposterous, ludicrous and defy truth, common sense and logic.,0
We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies, and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time.,0
The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported.,1
And, by the way, I'm proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this.,1
These lies come from outlets whose past stories, and past claims, have already been discredited.,0
As Secretary of State, I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world.,1
The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts, because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears.,0
What's happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people, like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine ... and that magazine should be put out of business.,0
And over the years, I've spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities.,1
In addition to Anastasia, who spoke at the convention, another young man, Ryan Moore, also spoke there.,1
Six months ago, the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me, and the central witness they used said the story was false, that she was quoted inaccurately.,0
She said I was a great guy, and never made those remarks.,0
We demanded a retraction, but they refused to print it ... just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book, or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things.,0
I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old.,1
I was fighting for health care reform.,1
He was born with a rare form of dwarfism.,1
But he never let that stop him.,1
That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times.,0
He's had so many surgeries, we've lost count of them.,1
It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them.,0
But his family was always there for them and ... for him.,1
And he was the advocate for himself as he got older.,1
Now today, the same two discredited writers, who should have been fired from the times, tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago ... another ridiculous tale, no witnesses, no nothing.,0
Also, a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary.,0
The story was lovely but last night we hear, after 12 years, a new claim that I made inappropriate advances.,0
I ask a very simple question, why wasn't it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago?,0
Now he's a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district.,1
And he's just one of the most optimistic people you'll ever meet.,1
I was one of the biggest stars on television, and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year.,0
Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance, never got the chance to get the education, let alone go to college, become forces for change.,1
And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America.,1
Take a look at her words.,0
I'll never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said.,1
It would have been the headline.,0
Some of you may be too young to know who he was.,1
He was a huge star.,1
No, it only appears 26 days before the election.,0
This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony ... the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false.,0
This weekend, the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years.,0
But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them.,0
Others have likewise were presented with this story, but after seeing the evidence we provided, refused to print it.,0
He played Superman.,1
This is part of a concerted effort, led by the New York Times, which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival, and which probably won't even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook, has become more and more vicious and vile.,0
He was unbelievably good-looking.,1
He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine.,1
And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident.,1
He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics, 'family values.',1
I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies, but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people.,0
But let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies.,0
'Since my accident,' he said, 'I've found a definition that seems to make sense.,1
I think it means that we're all family and we all have value.',1
They are false and slanderous in every respect.,0
I couldn't agree more.,1
We've come a long way since the fall of 1973, when I was going door to door talking to kids and families.,1
We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime ... indeed one the most important elections in modern history ... and the polls show us in a dead heat.,0
And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead.,0
So now, the Clinton Machine, has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met, worked with and employed ... in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense.,0
But make no mistake.,1
Again, this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government.,0
When I declared my candidacy, I knew what bad shape our country was in.,0
I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics.,0
We still have a lot more work to do.,1
I knew they would throw every lie they could at me, and my family, and my loved ones.,0
We can't be satisfied, not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities aren't in the workforce, not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage [cheers and applause], not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day.,1
We've got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities, values their work, treats them with respect. ,1
I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me.,0
Now, one advocate after another has told me the same thing, 'We don't want pity.,1
We want paychecks.,1
We want the chance to contribute.',1
But I take all of these slings and arrows for you.,0
I take them for our movement, so that we can have our country back.,0
Our great civilization, here in America and across the civilized world, has come upon a moment of reckoning.,0
We've seen it in the United Kingdom, where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.,0
As president, I'm going to give ... give them that chance.,1
First, we're going to focus on jobs and incomes.,1
I'm going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits.,1
People with disabilities shouldn't be isolated.,1
But the central base of world political power is here in America, and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people.,0
Their financial resources are unlimited.,0
They should be given the chance to work with everyone else.,1
And we're going to eliminate the subminimum wage, which is a vestige from an ugly, ignorant past.,1
Good work deserves fair pay, no matter who you are.,1
Their political resources are unlimited.,0
Their media resources are unlimited.,0
Second, we're going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities.,1
And, most importantly, the depths of their immorality is unlimited.,0
To have a truly inclusive economy, we need a truly inclusive education system.,1
Our political establishment has no soul.,0
So let's raise our standards.,1
I knew these false attacks would come.,0
I knew this day would arrive.,0
For too long, accessibility has been an afterthought.,1
Let's make it a priority in our curriculums, our classrooms, and the technology our students use.,1
And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve.,0
It's like what Anastasia said about her sister.,1
The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you.,0
The only force strong enough to save this country is you.,0
The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American People.,0
They control the Department of Justice, and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States ... in the back of her airplane, while on the runway ... for 39 minutes ... to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton.,0
Likewise, they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what he's done to one of our great institutions.,0
She can communicate through a computer.,1
Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings, and far more ... and yet he let her off the hook, while others lives are being destroyed for far less.,0
This is a conspiracy against you, the American people.,0
This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization.,0
Then let's make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so.,1
I didn't need to do this.,0
Third, we're going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired.,1
As part of that, we'll launch a new effort we're calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace.,1
Fourth, let's build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.,1
I built a great company, and I had a wonderful life.,0
I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family, instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies, deceptions and malicious attacks.,0
It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum, and it's a chance to show American values and American leadership.,1
And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady, I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country.,1
When I was secretary of state, I went to 112 countries.,1
And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities.,1
I'm doing it because this country has given me so much, and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back.,0
Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell.,0
But they are wrong, it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people.,0
Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away, basically forgotten.,1
In my former life, I was an insider as much as anybody else ... and I know what's like to be an insider.,0
Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam.,0
Because I used to be part of the club, I'm the only one who can fix it.,0
I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities.,1
Now, these ideas are just a start.,1
We're working with advocates to come up with even more.,1
I'm doing this for the people, and this movement is just right ... and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again.,0
The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise.,0
They know, that if we win, their power is gone and returned to you.,0
The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted, and replaced with a bright future ... but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future, or whether we let the American people decide our future.,0
If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work, then no other highly successful person ... which is what our country needs ... will ever again run for this office.,0
If you've got an idea, we want to hear it.,1
I will not lie to you.,0
These false attacks hurt.,0
Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate.,1
To be lied about, to be slandered, to be smeared so publicly and before your family, is painful.,0
What the Clinton Machine is doing to me, and my family, is egregious beyond words.,0
This issue is very close to my heart.,1
I've always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military.,1
It's how we treat our fellow human beings, especially the most vulnerable among us.,1
It is reprehensible beyond description.,0
And on this front especially, I intend for my presidency to move our country forward.,1
Together, we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream.,1
Now, if you want some proof, let me tell you this story.,1
It's a story of a woman named Freia David.,1
But I also know, it's not about me ... it's about all of you.,0
It's about all of us, together, as a country.,0
It's about the Veterans who need medical care, the mothers who've lost children to terrorism and crime, it's about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help, it's about the millions of jobless Americans.,0
Now, some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe.,1
This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare, and it's about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution.,0
I've carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much.,1
Freia has Down syndrome.,1
When she was 21, she got her first job, at the local McDonald's.,1
Her mother was a little worried, as any mother would be.,1
This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime, poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton.,0
She wondered, would Freia be able to handle being independent?,1
Could she handle the job?,1
Would she even pass the six-month training program?,1
Well, not everyone in her class passed, but Freia did.,1
And then ... then she excelled at that job for 32 years.,1
Her colleagues loved her, and she loved them.,1
The restaurant became such a home to her that she'd bring her family there on off days just to hang out. ,1
They've robbed these citizens of their future, and I will give them their hope, jobs and opportunities back.,0
I will deliver.,0
Earlier this year, Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia.,1
This election is about every man, woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety, prosperity and peace.,0
We will rise above the lies, the smears, and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters.,0
She knew that meant she had to stop working, but 32 years is a pretty good run, isn't it?,1
We will vote for the country we want.,0
It broke her heart.,1
One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor.,1
Her family hoped a few people might show up.,1
And in the end, nearly 100 people did: customers, colleagues and friends from over the years.,1
The party lasted three hours.,1
We will vote for the future we want.,0
We will vote for the politics we want.,0
And at one point, one of Freia's former managers asked for everyone's attention.,1
She turned to Freia, and she said, 'We love you.,1
We appreciate you.,1
We respect you.,1
We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business.,0
And we are all better people for having you in our lives.',1
We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers, our borders, our freedoms, and our sovereign rights as a nation.,0
My friends, after years of hard work and treating people right, isn't that what we all want to hear?,1
We will end the politics of profit, we will end the rule of special interests, we will put a stop to the raiding of our country ... and the disenfranchisement of our people.,0
Isn't that America at our best?,1
Our Independence Day is at hand, and it arrives, finally, on November 8th.,0
Join me in taking back our country, and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people.,0
We don't thrive on tearing each other apart, or separating ourselves.,1
As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.,0
We know we are stronger together.,1
This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.,0
Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.,0
We believe in equality and dignity for all.,1
And when we fall short, we strive to do better, not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves, to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for.,1
Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful.,0
This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal, to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America, to say loudly and clearly in this country, no one's worthless, no one's 'less than.',1
Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure.,0
She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.,0
To further cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear ... some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.,0
We're all of value.,1
In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe everyone is created equal.,1
She even pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified.,0
And you know what else we believe?,1
As the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clinton's closest associates demonstrates, the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit.,0
The Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in.,0
We all believe love trumps hate.,1
The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we've ever seen before ... including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters, and a private position for Wall Street.,0
Thank you all.",1
<i>Audience Member:</i> We're proud of you!,1
<i>Clinton:</i> Thank you.,1
Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
Hillary should have been convicted long ago.,0
Thank you.,1
That the legal process has been taking this long is incredible.,0
And I think her ...,1
And now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI ... that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her.,0
I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality, that get-up-and-go personality, is going to mean a lot to the people she's taking care of.,1
97% of Department of Justice employees' presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.,0
So Christine, thank you and Godspeed.,1
There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General.,0
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona.,0
He said it was to play golf, but he never played, and it was over 100 degrees.,0
This is what we mean when we call it a rigged system.,0
Now the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right ... but what should have been done many months ago.,0
Now, I have to thank ...,1
I have to thank Dr. Stephen Scott, the president of Wake Tech Community College, all the administrators, the faculty, and the students of Wake Tech.,1
Now, Dr. Scott told me that the enrollment's about 73,000.,1
Perhaps, through this other investigation, they found what may be some of the 33,000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy, even going so far as to use digital bleach.,0
And what a tribute to what this institution represents.,1
The stakes on November 8th could not be higher.,0
A vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system.,0
And I am a huge, huge supporter.,1
What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws ... Hillary's corruption shreds that foundational principle.,0
I just see America differently.,1
Public Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy.,0
Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, and infects the operations of government itself.,0
I think there's nothing we can't do if we make our minds up, roll up our sleeves, get working together, support institutions like Wake Tech, support people like Christine.,1
If the corruption is not removed, then the people are not able to have faith in their government.,0
And that's what I intend to do.,1
Now, I want to thank your mayor, Mayor McFarlane.,1
Thank you so much for being here.,1
It deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation.,0
Corruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system.,0
State Senator Dan Blue, Jr.,1
I also want to recognize Linda Coleman, candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina.,1
When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope.,0
They detach.,0
Linda came so close last time.,1
And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line?,1
And I'll tell you somebody else I'm really excited about.,1
That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate, former State Representative Deborah Ross.,1
Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged.,0
I have watched ...,1
I have watched the campaign she's run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it.,1
When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then the laws lose their moral authority.,0
I'll tell you what, we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina.,1
I want to thank all the elected officials who are here, and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husband's and mine, somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship.,1
Hillary believes money and power ... not truth and justice ... should rule the day.,0
That's former Governor Jim Hunt.,1
As FDR once said, government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.,0
Now, there's a lot that I want to talk about today.,1
This is what we often see in Third World countries ... where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment.,0
Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government, and it must be stopped.,0
Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.,0
We must save the America.,0
That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests.,0
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say.,0
When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.,0
But let me start with this because you may or may not know.,1
A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
It's just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums.,0
Today is National Voter Registration Day.,1
And you see some signs people are holding.,1
Elect me, and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD.,0
'I Will Vote.',1
WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE.,0
Now, that's not only a great sign that shows you're committed to vote, but it's a website.,1
And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered.,1
Every single one of Arizona's 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare.,0
And I hope you all will, and I hope you'll tell everybody that you know to do the same, because we want to make sure people are registered.,1
And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina, and I hope that you will, because think about everything that's at stake in this election right here in North Carolina.,1
The very mean-spirited, wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state.,1
In Phoenix, there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year.,0
But more than that, it's hurt people.,1
It has sent a message to so many people that, well, you're not really wanted.,1
You're not really part of us.,1
Next year there will be only one.,0
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people.,1
And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year.,0
Now, they were pretty blatant about it.,1
Make it harder for people of color.,1
Make it harder for the elderly.,1
And make it harder for the young.,1
One insurer in the state will have a $14,000 deductible.,0
Now, some of that's been rolled back, thankfully, because it was so wrong and, I would argue, unconstitutional.,1
But the best way to show, hey, in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous, vibrant debate, that's what it's about.,1
Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona, and a catastrophe for all of America.,0
Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.",0
In Minnesota, where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent, the Democratic Governor has said "the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.",0
Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, admitted it was all a fraud, and he said, outrageously, that it was passed because of the "stupidity of the American voter.",0
But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote.,1
Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare, making it even more expensive.,0
That's the way we're supposed to be making decisions.,1
My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and I'm asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona.,0
It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that.,1
Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington.,0
Now, I have won elections and I have lost elections, so I know what the difference is.,1
But I'll tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us, to govern ourselves, to continue to widen the circle of opportunity, and that includes the opportunity to be heard, to express yourself, your voice and your vote.,1
And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote, and demonstrate the importance of your vote. ,1
I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election.,1
Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout we've ever had.,1
As you have heard, it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton.,0
This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and it is everybody's deepest hope that justice, at last, can be delivered.,0
Now, that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future, and who we are fighting for.,1
Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles.,0
Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional, and purposeful.,0
Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure ... and exposure.,0
But early information is actually quite encouraging.,1
She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk, and put the safety and security of your children at risk.,0
We're seeing spikes in early voting.,1
And we're seeing voting rates among African Americans, Latinos, and young people going up.,1
And for the first time, the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote.,1
Now, I would love to see that.,1
But she didn't care ... as long as she and Bill got the money, the safety of your family didn't matter.,0
Obviously, I hope people vote for me.,1
To cover-up her crimes, she bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, made 13 phones disappear ... some with a hammer, lied to Congress under oath, lied to the FBI many times, and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing.,0
But I would love to see that because every election is about the future.,1
And honestly, it's more about the future of young people and children than it's ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent.,1
Now, last night I got a chance ...,1
The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government.,0
Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and, if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
She'd put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators ... whoever offers the highest price.,0
I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if I'm so fortunate enough to be elected as your president.,1
And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm asking for your vote, I should tell you what I want to do.,1
Yet, now it's reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI ... that's because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton.,0
97% of Department of Justice employee's presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton.,0
There are those, and I happen to be one of them, who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President.,0
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona.,0
And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together.,1
You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.,1
This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged.,0
A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption, graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself.,0
And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together.,1
You see, I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren.,1
I think about that a lot, in part because I started out working for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws, and that we are all equal under those laws ... Hillary's corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded.,0
Government corruption spreads outward, like a cancer, infecting the whole operation of our government.,0
When the outcome is fixed, when the system is rigged, people lose hope ... they stop dreaming, they stop trying.,0
When the powerful can get away with anything, because they have the money and the connections to rig the system, then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future.,0
Hillary's corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation, and it must be stopped.,0
It's always been my passion about what we can do [applause] to help more kids live up to their God-given potential.,1
And during this campaign, people have asked me, 'Well, how did you get interested in that?,1
As FDR once said, "government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob.",0
'And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood.,1
Hillary believes money and power ... not truth and justice ... should rule the day.,0
We have one ultimate check on Hillary's corruption, and that is the power of voting.,0
The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions, including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives.,0
She was basically abandoned by her parents, sent to live with grandparents who didn't want her.,1
Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again.,0
Restoring honesty to our government, and the rule of law to our society, will be my highest priority as President.,0
By the age of 14, she was out on her own working in a home babysitting, keeping house.,1
She was basically a maid.,1
Haven't we had enough drama with the Clintons?,0
And when I think about my mother's own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers, she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people.,1
Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice, signed the worst trade deal in history, NAFTA, which emptied our country of it's manufacturing jobs, and he doesn't even have the right to practice law.,0
Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched.,0
Look at Whitewater, cattle futures, jobs in Upstate New York, or look at Syria, Iraq, Libya, and now her emails.,0
We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other, the respect we show, the kindness, the love that we show.,1
This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough.,0
This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future.,0
My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption.,0
And I'm well aware that's not something you put necessarily on a campaign website, but I've been talking about it because I think we've got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other.,1
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say.,0
When we win on November 8th, We Are Going To Washington, D.C. And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP.,0
At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs.,0
When my mother was in first grade, she never had any food, and her first grade teacher noticed that.,1
Right now, 70 million American women and children live in poverty, or near the brink of poverty.,0
America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA.,0
America has lost 70,000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.,0
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
In those days, they just brought food, a little bag of food, then they'd sit in the classroom and eat it, and my mother never had any food.,1
And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her.,1
She would say, 'You know, Dorothy, I brought too much food.,1
Hillary's goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country.,0
Would you like this sandwich?,1
Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent, massively expand regulation, shut down American energy, and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors.,0
Her policies will cause a major recession, or even a depression.,0
A Trump Administration will stop TPP, renegotiate NAFTA, and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation.,0
We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
Would you like this milk?',1
And it wasn't until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year, something she didn't have to do, but her love for her students, her recognition of a child who wasn't well taken care of meant that she stepped in.,1
And then when my mother worked as a maid, she really wanted to go to high school.,1
We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars.,0
She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents' home.,1
My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11, which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas.,0
We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.,0
We will become a rich nation once again.,0
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school, and so she said to her, 'If you get up early ... it sounds like Christine getting up so early.,1
If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school.',1
A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
And that's what my mother did for four years, she got up early and then she literally had to run, run to get to high school.,1
We have the endorsement of America's ICE and Border Patrol Officers, the first time they have ever made an endorsement.,0
When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldn't take them back.,0
It sounds harsh, but not for my mom.,1
These were people guilty of murder, assault, rape, and all manner of violent crime.,0
Hillary has pledged "open borders," and supports Sanctuary Cities.,0
Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government won't do it's job.,0
These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, of Mesa Arizona, who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported ... but the government refused to act.,0
She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live, gave her food to eat, gave her the chance to go to high school.,1
So when I talk about us being stronger together, I'm not just talking about what our government needs to do, I'm talking about what each of us can do to contribute.,1
We do need to make sure ... we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top, and that means we've got to make investments in more good, new jobs, infrastructure jobs, advanced manufacturing jobs, technology and innovation, clean renewable energy jobs.,1
And we've got to do more to help small businesses because that's where most of the new jobs will come from.,1
I've spent time with his incredible mother.,0
28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders.,0
As I said last night, my dad was a small businessman.,1
When he got out of the Navy after World War II, he started this small business printing drapery fabrics, and he had a print plant in Chicago.,1
It was just ... it was dark room.,1
Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument.,0
33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle, a young cancer survivor, was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant.,0
There was no natural light.,1
Nick was shot twice in the back of the head.,0
21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck, was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant.,0
His illegal immigrant killer, despite a criminal record, was out on bond, roaming free.,0
He had two long tables and he'd spread that fabric on the table, and then he would take silkscreens ... if you've ever seen one ... and he'd start at one end and he'd put it down, he'd pour the paint in, and he'd take the squeegee and he'd lift it up and he'd go all the way down to the end of one table, and then he'd start on the other table, and he would do that until he got the job done.,1
And I would help him out from time to time, so I knew how hard he worked.,1
When I become President, this crime wave ends.,0
We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities.,0
We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation.,0
But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker.,1
And so he was able to do what we want to see in America, keep going, keep reaching, move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you.,1
So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone, to grow the economy, to create more jobs, but I also want a fairer economy because ... when you work hard, you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year.,1
We will end illegal immigration, deport every last criminal alien, and save American lives.,0
We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.,0
But if you are a minimum wage worker, if you work full time minimum wage, you will make $15,000 a year.,1
Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women, most of them with families to support.,1
And I've talked to a lot of these women.,1
Sometimes I'll be at a caf.. or sometimes I'll be in a store and I'll just start talking to them, and they will tell me ... it's one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if you're open to it, folks will tell you what's on their minds and their hearts.,1
We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients.,0
So I've met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids.,1
Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been, and my plan builds the modern, advanced fighter aircraft we need ... fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base.,0
So we need to raise the national minimum wage and ... and we need to guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work because ... number one, it's fair.,1
It's fair.,1
And if your mother, your wife, your sister, or your daughter is working, don't you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?,1
Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II, and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence ... that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca, home of the Army's Intelligence Center.,0
And the other thing I want to do, I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place.,1
Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft ... they won't have to get spare parts from museums anymore.,0
We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First.,0
It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives.,1
Hillary's policies unleashed ISIS, empowered Iran, and spread death and destruction across the Middle East.,0
Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East, and now it's in worse shape than ever before.,0
Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family.,0
They've dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe, they have left our borders wide open at home, and they've shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.,0
I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work.,1
And last night at the debate, one of my guests was Mark Cuban.,1
Now, Mark Cuban, who is a real billionaire, by the way, he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business, and he not only used it while the business was going, but when the business was sold.,1
He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight.,1
To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership.,0
Now, that's the kind of business leadership I want to hold up, because what we've seen from my opponent is someone, who his own campaign manager has said, builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy, stiffing people ... dishwashers, painters, plumbers, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers ... across America.,1
Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days ...,0
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day, but they really mean another decade.,0
Hillary has been there for 30 years, and she has accomplished nothing ... she's just made things worse.,0
Some of them have come forward.,1
She is the candidate of yesterday.,0
We are the movement of the future.,0
Our movement represents all Americans, from all backgrounds, and all walks of life.,0
You can go to our website; you can see their stories.,1
We are asking for the votes of Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and first-time voters.,0
It's heartbreaking.,1
And as I said last night, I'm really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business.,1
We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people ... not the donors and special interests.,0
We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community, and every American family, who yearns for a better future.,0
And in addition to making the economy fair, we've got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work.,1
It's really hard out there, isn't it?,1
And just listening to Christine's story ... getting up at 4:00 and studying, getting kids up at 7:00, going to school, going to work, going to another job ... that's not an uncommon story.,1
We've made it really hard for a lot of people.,1
With your vote, we are just 10 days away from the change you've been waiting for your entire life.,0
So here's what I think we need to do, and it's not a luxury, it's a necessity ... because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them.,1
Together, We Will Make America JUST Again.,0
And I've heard so many stories.,1
They've told me ... people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses they're under.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
So let's finally, since every other advanced economy has already done this, let's have paid family leave so that when you're sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn, you can take care of your loved ones.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
And let's have earned sick days so that you don't lose your job because you're sick or you go to work because you're sick.,1
And let's finally have affordable childcare, which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition.,1
I don't think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare, and we're going to fix that so that becomes the norm.,1
In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.,0
Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.,0
Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
And then let's make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget.,1
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
Now, tomorrow in New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary.,1
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
And I want ...,1
I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way.,1
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
And we're also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner.,1
Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.,0
Now, how are we going to do that?,1
We are also going to end government corruption.,0
Well, we're going to go where the money is, and the money is at the top.,1
We're going to go after millionaires, billionaires and corporations.,1
We're going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, and we're going to close corporate loopholes.,1
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.,0
And I believe that we can get that done, in part because you're going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so we're going to have another Democratic senator.,1
But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again ... not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence.,1
Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes.,0
That hasn't worked out so well.,1
The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server.,0
In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.,0
We've got to get back to first principles.,1
This is a criminal conspiracy ... a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.,0
Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified.,0
Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.,0
Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go.,1
We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.,0
But it gets even worse.,0
The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a "quid pro quo.",0
This is felony corruption.,0
Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.,0
Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.,0
This is magnitudes worse than Watergate.,0
And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.,0
Let's be a government for the struggling, the striving and the successful.,1
But there's still more.,0
Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists.,0
So I'm excited about what we can do.,1
One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, "take the money!!",0
with two exclamation points.,0
This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.,0
I really am.,1
Remember, we are competing in a rigged election ... the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters.,0
And I'm going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of ... all of Donald Trump's claims.,1
The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved ... Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.,0
There were ... there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night.,1
A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton.,0
But here's a couple of things that caught my attention.,1
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes.,1
In fact, I think there's a strong probability he hasn't paid federal taxes a lot of years.,1
And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution, from health care to education, our vets.,1
They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.,0
The following comes straight from Pew Research.,0
But he probably hasn't paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems.,1
And when I confronted him with the reasons why he won't release his tax returns ... and I got to that point where I said, well, maybe he's paid zero ... he said that makes him smart.,1
QUOTE: "Approximately 24 million...one of every eight...voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.",0
Now, if not paying taxes makes him smart, what does that make all the rest of us?,1
I got to tell you, Bill and I have been blessed.,1
We didn't come from millionaire families.,1
QUOTE: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters.",0
My husband's father ... his biological father died before he was born.,1
His mother went to nursing school in order to support him.,1
QUOTE: "Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state.",0
Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting.,0
They struggled.,1
They worked hard.,1
And America gave him the chance to get a good education, pursue his dreams, end up being President.,1
My dad, as I told you, worked hard.,1
The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post.,0
So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years.,1
The article was entitled: "could non-citizens decide the November election?",0
And if you look, you'll see that we paid the highest marginal rate.,1
Here are some excerpts.,0
QUOTE: "More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote.",0
We tried to give 10 percent to charity.,1
QUOTE: "Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections.,0
Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.,0
It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina.,0
Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that we've been given, we should do our part.,1
The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen.,1
Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin.",0
Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.,0
The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.,0
I don't think I'd make a big bragging point out of that.,1
If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.,0
But he seemed to feel like, hey, it shows you how smart I am.,1
We will not let that happen.,0
It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,0
He basically said, 'Yeah, if the housing market crashes, I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money.',1
I got to tell you, what kind of person believes that?,1
That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.,0
What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes?,1
One who should never be president is the answer to that question.,1
And he made it very clear that he didn't prepare for that debate.,1
At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared.,1
When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave.,0
But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort.,1
And I said, 'Yeah.,1
But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do ... he rigged the system on his way out.,0
You know what?,1
Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.,0
So, here is what I am announcing tonight.,0
I did prepare.,1
And I'll tell you something else I prepared for.,1
First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service.,0
I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.,0
Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.,0
I prepared to be president of the United States, and I think that's good.',1
Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.,0
So as I said in the beginning, we have two different visions here.,1
I believe we are stronger together.,1
Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.,0
And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.,0
That is at the core of what I've done over my years in advocacy and public service.,1
I believe that America is already great, and it is our responsibility to make it even greater.,1
I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone, we also need to keep our country safe, and we need to provide strong, steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners.,1
I've laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues.,1
I've laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS.,1
Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.,0
And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent.,1
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
It's unclear exactly what he is saying.,1
But words matter.,1
And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia, "Hey, we're not sure we're going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty.",1
Words matter.,1
At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.,0
People here that and they start to doubt America's word, America's intention.,1
I felt like I had to jump in and say, 'I just want to be clear.,1
We will honor our treaties.,1
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.,0
We will support our allies and our partners.',1
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.,0
This is not reality TV.,1
This is real.,1
Briggs &amp; Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.,0
It's as real as it gets.,1
so we're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.,0
Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.,0
We're going to keep America safe, provide strong, steady leadership, and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other.,1
Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night, are they?,1
There's still a lot we don't know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte, but this we do know: We've got to bring communities together.,1
The list goes on and on.,0
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.,0
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
We will be a rich nation once again.,0
We have to listen to each other.,1
We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect, and respect for the law from the communities that are protected. ,1
And we've got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many, too many lives in our country.,1
Again, I think we can come together.,1
A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks.,1
They believe in the Second Amendment, as I do.,1
They believe in the right of individuals to have guns, as I do.,1
But they believe, along with me, that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people, and make it so easy to get them.,1
So there's work to do.,1
But it's great work.,1
It's important work, starting right here in North Carolina.,1
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
National Security begins at the border.,0
We have 42 days left.,1
This election's going to be close.,1
They all are these days.,1
That's why every call you make, every door you knock on, every friend you register to vote, to make the difference.,1
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
I want you, if you can, to text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina.,1
And I know there's a big overflow room, and I'm told they can hear me, so to my friends in the overflow, we want you to be just as involved as anyone else.,1
Thank you for coming.,1
By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.,0
By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.,0
In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are "Un-American.",0
So remember, here in North Carolina, starting on October 20th, you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county.,1
So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.,0
And remember, it's not just the presidential race.,1
It's the governor's race, the lieutenant governor's race, the U.S. Senate race, and other races up and down the ticket.,1
Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election.,1
Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.,0
So let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
We're not fearful.,1
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
We don't want to build walls.,1
We want to build bridges.,1
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
We don't want to turn against each other.,1
We want to work with one another.,1
We want to set big goals again here in our country.,1
I've got some big goals that I know we can achieve.,1
Take climate change, which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.,1
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen, and I want us to take advantage of that.,1
Do the right thing and benefit from it.,1
That's what I'm offering.,1
We're going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration.,1
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years.,1
And we're going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.,0
The ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S.,0
history.",0
Now, the way things are stacking up, I think it's either going to be Germany, China, or us.,1
Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:,0
I want it to be us and it will be us.,1
--Support for Sanctuary Cities,0
--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens,0
That is exactly right.,1
--Obamacare for illegal immigrants,0
I love this country.,1
--No deportation of visa overstays,0
--Expanding catch-and-release on the border,0
I'm proud of this country.,1
--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers,0
I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country, sets those goals, gets about the business of achieving them, and proves once and for all that love trumps hate.,1
--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives,0
Thank you!",1
--A 550% increase in Syrian refugees,0
Either we win this election, or we lose the country.,0
Under a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.,0
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
Bernie's campaign energized so many young people, some of you in this crowd.,1
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives, your jobs, the kind of country we are, the kind of future we want to build together.,1
I'm proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran.,1
We ran a campaign about issues, not insults.,1
You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.,0
And when it was over, we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education, in health and so much else.,1
Thank you, Bernie.,1
On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
Thank you for your leadership, and thank you for your support in this campaign.,1
Now, we're going to need some help in Washington.,1
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.,0
I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.,0
And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator.,1
I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.,0
I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.,0
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors.,0
And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
Isn't this one of the strangest elections you've ever seen?,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
I ...,1
You're going to remember this day.,0
I really sometimes don't know what to make of it.,1
Standing on that debate stage the other night, I was especially thinking about that.,1
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
And, look, I have been very clear about what I want to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected president.,1
And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that we're not only electing a president, we're electing a commander-in-chief.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We're looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world.,1
I was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner, a retired Republican senator, World War II veteran, former ... former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism.,1
And it's a great honor.,1
He's never endorsed a Democrat for president before.,1
In 19 days, we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House.,0
Early voting is underway, so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person.,0
Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today.,0
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election ... if I win!,0
ALTERNATE:,0
Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to make a major announcement today.,0
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States, that when the results come in on election night, I will accept ... without delay or hesitation ... the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton.,0
Now, seriously, the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won, including every single online poll, some by 90-10.,0
The question of voter fraud came up during the debate.,0
We want fairness in the election, having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country.,0
And I'm also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign.,1
John Podesta, Hillary's Campaign Chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks, as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers' Licenses.,0
One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence.,0
In fact, it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are. ,1
This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful, Democratic elections.,0
The next ... the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years.,1
A campaign like Clinton's that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything.,0
And a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who will lie to the Congress and the FBI, destroy 33,000 emails, put her office up for sale, and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies ... is a candidate who is truly capable of anything.,0
So I'm going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families.,1
That's been the cause of my life.,1
In addition, it was just learned, Hillary was given the exact debate questions, word for word, by Donna Brazile ... who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.,0
But I ask you, why shouldn't Hillary Clinton resign from the race ... she was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?,0
And it will be the mission of my presidency.,1
And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early, it's not just my name on the ballot.,1
Every issue you care about, think about it because, in effect, it's on the ballot, too.,1
It's whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial.,1
This is a big deal.,1
I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence, 'I believe in science.',1
Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question ... he got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.,0
This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.,0
Climate change is real.,1
It's serious.,1
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.,0
So it's in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree, in advance, to concede the results on election night.,0
This is an unprecedented question.,0
And we have to be united and committed in addressing it.,1
I never thought I'd hear someone running for president, my opponent, who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans, overturn a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more.,1
So there's a lot at stake.,1
If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount, then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V. Gore.,0
And that's why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before.,1
In effect, I'm being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters.,0
We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before.,1
And that's why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives.,1
According to Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate.,0
And one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs.,1
1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead ... which is a hard thing to do, but easy if fraud is involved).,0
Bernie is absolutely right.,1
I remember when I went to college, my dad, who was a small business man ... he had saved up money, but I had to work.,1
I had to work through college, work during the school year, work during summers, but that was okay.,1
2.8 million people are registered in more than one state.,0
And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote.,0
So what I'm saying is, we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful.,0
America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws.,0
These laws are triggered in the case of fraud, or in the event a recount is needed.,0
Of course I would accept a clear election result, but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result.,0
I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me.,0
But, none of this will matter, since we are going to win big on November 8th.,0
We were able to put it together.,1
It wasn't so much that it endangered me or my family's financial future.,1
Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
And then I decided to go to law school, and my dad said, 'Well, I can't help you.,1
That ... we're done.,1
We can't help you.',1
So I kept working.,1
I got a small scholarship, but then I took out loans.,1
And I paid those loans back.,1
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come, not a fixed interest rate.,1
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
That's why I could go to work for the Children's Defense Fund.,1
I think I made $14,000 a year, as I recall.,1
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
Your companies won't be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration.,0
Right now, our economy isn't growing at all.,0
I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing.,1
It's absolutely wrong, and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams, to have that education, to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve.,1
I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.,0
Now, New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student.,1
As a student I met here in New Hampshire said, going to college should be hard, but paying for college shouldn't be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education.,1
Indeed, here in New Hampshire, we've got so many young people graduating with debt who aren't able to get started in their careers, aren't able to do the jobs like I could do, because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down.,1
Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less.,0
Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.,0
Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.,0
So we should, and we will, make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year.,1
And if you already have student debt, like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire, we will help you refinance it.,1
Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.,0
It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt, and it is even worse that you're being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house, to buy a car, to borrow money for a business.,1
When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in.,0
That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.,0
I don't know how we got to where we are, but we are going to fix it.,1
This is wrong.,1
It's wrong for students, it's wrong for families, and it's wrong for our country.,1
Right now, our politicians don't do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests ... Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries.,0
I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business.,1
That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.,0
They want to be entrepreneurs.,1
It's time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C.,0
Those reforms include the following:,0
It's the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going.,1
But they can't get credit because they have student debt.,1
A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service.,0
A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.,0
Nobody will help them out, no matter how good the idea is.,1
A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.,0
Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.,0
So we're going to put a moratorium, so you don't have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started, and you get the chance to get the credit you need.,1
We are also ... we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service.,1
And in Florida on Friday I'll give a speech about why that is so important.,1
It's about time.,0
Now, when you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars.,1
Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you, not in general, but really specifically you, the situation you're in.,1
Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.,0
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.,0
To check it out, go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.,1
Now, we have an example right here, and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website.,1
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.,0
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and China's entrance into the World Trade Organization ... two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters.,0
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
You can say, 'I have student debt,' you can say, 'I am planning for college,' you can put in what your annual household income is, how much you will save, and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I don't want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you.,1
You can choose whether you have student debt.,1
I met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said, 'Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into.',1
I hear that so much.,1
You know, these financial aid forms, one is called FAFSA, it takes forever to fill out, and at the end of it you really don't know what it means?,1
Well, we're going to be really explicit.,1
You know, we do have technology in America.,1
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.,0
And we ought to use it more to help people understand what they're getting into and to provide alternatives so that they don't make the wrong decisions for themselves.,1
I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States, and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and all across this great nation.,0
American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.,0
So, please, use this, you know?,1
You will save $60,640 if you're in one of these categories.,1
In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office.,0
It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce.,0
The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.,0
It's going to be America First.,0
But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody.,1
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.,0
African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.,0
The violence is unbearable.,0
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.,0
There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.,0
Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator.,1
And it's getting worse.,0
To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?,0
Vote for Donald Trump.,0
I will fix it.,0
We will be a rich nation once again.,0
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all don't turn out and vote.,1
National Security begins at the border.,0
None of it.,1
You know, I see all the signs saying, 'I will vote.',1
There is also a website.,1
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.,0
Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure you're registered.,1
Just last week, an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clinton's State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS.,0
So let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
All the information is there.,1
You put in your name, you put in your address, and through the miracle of technology you can find out if you're registered, or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again.,1
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
New Hampshire makes it easy.,1
You can have same-day registration.,1
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
So both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together.,1
I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America.,1
Bringing people together is what I'm going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president.,1
And if you've had a chance to see or meet my running mate, Tim Kaine, you know how hard he'll work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results.,1
There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today.,0
Every year, countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities.,0
My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities, like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant.,0
If I am elected President, I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.,0
We are going to save American lives.,0
So we're going to move now to the panel, and I'm very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating, along with Doug Martin, who you heard from earlier.,1
Either we win this election, or we lose the country.,0
I know they have collected up questions from the crowd.,1
But I will end by saying that I'm excited about what we can do to make college affordable, and especially as Bernie rightly said, open the doors to families and young people who have been left out.,1
We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round, and we want to make sure that we have ... specific help for certain groups of students.,1
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
I'll end with this story.,1
I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago, and I met a lot of students, not only in the law school but students on campus.,1
I'd go and eat with them and go to events with them, and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money, but then something happened.,1
You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.,0
Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.,0
You know, maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart.,1
It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.,0
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.,0
Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation.,1
I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.,0
Or maybe they had a health emergency.,1
And they would come and they would say to me, 'What can I do?,1
I'm going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.,0
Where can I get the $300 to fix the car?,1
Where can I find childcare?,1
I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries.,0
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors and special interests.,0
And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
How can I pay the doctor's bills?',1
And I realized that we've got to take care of tuition, making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school.,1
We've got to make sure costs and expenses, Pell grants and other ways of helping.,1
But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund, because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents, mostly, but not always, single moms, young, divorced, pretty much on their own, trying to improve their lives and prospects.,1
And we started a fund to help fill those gaps, and, you know, we did it over so many years now, about 35 years, and we've helped thousands of people, so they didn't have to drop out.,1
You're going to remember this day.,0
They didn't have to cut back.,1
That's what I want for our country again, where we're helping each other, where we're reaching out and giving everybody a chance, and, yes, sometimes a second or third chance, to make the most of their lives, to pursue their dreams.,1
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, and education is absolutely essential to it. ,1
So please make sure you come out and vote in this election.,1
Thank you, all.",1
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
You know, earlier tonight, Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent, he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas, Joseph T. Robinson, who was one of my husband's political heroes.,1
Because if we win ...,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
This work that you do through the dinner ... Al, you've done it now for 30 ... 30 years ... is such a labor of love.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
You've been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York.,1
In 18 days, we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House.,0
And I think we all owe Al Smith a great, great round of applause.,1
This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here.,1
Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.,0
And as you've already heard, it's a treat for all of you too, because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this.,1
Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your ballot.,0
But, for me, it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist, Al Smith.,1
Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
If he were here today and saw how much money we've raised for needy children, he'd be very proud.,1
And if he saw this magnificent room, full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy, he'd be very confused.,1
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, unleash job-producing American energy, rebuild our military and take care of our Vets, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
It's a special honor to be here with Your Eminence.,1
Now I know, Your Eminence, you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight, and you responded by saying "If I only sat down with those who were saints, I'd be taking all my meals alone.",1
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
Now, just to be clear, I think the Cardinal is saying I'm not eligible for sainthood.,1
But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle.,1
So I guess I'm up against the highest, hardest stained-glass ceiling.,1
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
Your companies won't be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration.,0
But, Your Eminence, you deserve great credit for bringing together two people who've been at each other's throats ... mortal enemies, bitter foes; I've got to ask, how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?,1
We will be a strong nation again.,0
American Leadership has grown so weak, that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia.,0
Strength will also require growth.,0
Right now, our economy isn't growing at all.,0
We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter.,0
I'm going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years.,0
Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less.,0
Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.,0
Companies, like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico.,0
Now, I've got to say, there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that I've been privileged to know and to work with.,1
Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico.,0
When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.,0
I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables.,1
That means the companies won't leave in the first place and, if they do, we'll at least make money when they ship their products across the border.,0
Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries ... including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
And you look so good in your tuxes; or, as I refer to them, formal pantsuits.,1
That's how our system is corrupt and broken.,0
We're going to take on big donors, big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense.,0
And, you know, because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald, if at any time, you don't like what I'm saying feel free to stand up and shout "Wrong!",1
while I'm talking.,1
The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate, word for word, by Donna Brazile ... who is now under tremendous pressure to resign.,0
Hillary was given the questions, used the questions, and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate.,0
You know, come to think of it, it's amazing I'm up here after Donald.,1
I didn't think he'd be okay with a peaceful transition of power.,1
And, Donald, after listening to your speech, I will also enjoy listening to Mike Pence deny that you ever gave it.,1
Years ago there was a show called the $64,000 question ... a contestant got the questions in advance, his life was ruined.,0
This is even bigger, because we are playing for the presidency of the United States.,0
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency.,0
Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance ... more pay-for-play.,0
You know, I've had the privilege of being at the Al Smith dinners in years past and I always enjoy it.,1
That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.,0
But, remember, if you're not happy with the way it comes out, it must be rigged.,1
And it's always a special treat for me to be back in New York; a city that I love and which I think truly embodies the best of America.,1
You know ... don't you think?,1
People look at the Statue of Liberty and they see a proud symbol of our history as a nation of immigrants, a beacon of hope for people around the world.,1
It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,0
Those reforms include the following:,0
Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a "four.",1
A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service.,0
A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.,0
A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections.,0
Maybe a "five" if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair.,1
Additionally, I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.,0
Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.,0
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs,0
You know, come to think of it, you know what would be a good number for a woman?,1
Forty-five.,1
But I digress.,1
At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.,0
Now, I'm going to try my best tonight, but I understand I am not known for my sense of humor.,1
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.,0
That's why it did take a village to write these jokes.,1
We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
People say ... and I hear them, I know ... they say I'm boring compared to Donald.,1
We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.,0
But I'm not boring at all.,1
In fact, I'm the life of every party I attend and I've been to three.,1
And when the parties get out of hand, as occasionally they do, it's important to have a responsible chaperone who can get everyone home safely.,1
And that is why I picked Tim Kaine to be my Vice President.,1
Now, you notice there is no teleprompter here tonight, which is probably smart, because maybe you saw Donald dismantle his prompter the other day.,1
And I get that.,1
They're hard to keep up with, and I'm sure it's even harder when you're translating from the original Russian.,1
But every year, this dinner brings together a collection of sensible, committed, main-stream Republicans ... or, as we now like to call them ... Hillary supporters.,1
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to foreign cheating, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.,0
Now, some of my critics ... and I hear that too ...,1
We are going to start making things in America again ... and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again.,0
In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and so many other places, we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy.,0
American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, State and Treasury Department and the U.S. Trade Representative.,0
In my administration, all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office.,0
It will report to what we call the American Desk.,0
<i>Audience Member:</i> Yeah.,1
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Yeah.,1
They think I only say what people want to hear.,1
Well, tonight, that is true.,1
The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker, and the national interests of the United States.,0
It's going to be America First.,0
And here's exactly what you want to hear ... this election will be over very, very soon.,1
And look at this dais ... we've got Charlie Rose, and Maria Bartiromo, and Chris Mat-thews, and Gayle King, and Norah O'Donnell, and Katie Couric ... this counts as a press conference, right?,1
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
It is great, also, to see Mayor Bloomberg here.,1
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.,0
It's a shame he's not speaking tonight.,1
African- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.,0
The violence is unbearable.,0
I'm curious to hear what a billionaire has to say.,1
And look at the dais ... we've got the Honorable Chuck Schumer, the Honorable Andrew Cuomo, the Honorable Mike Bloomberg, the Honorable Bill DeBlasio, the Honorable Dave Dinkins, and so many other wonderful elected officials.,1
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.,0
There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.,0
And we have Rudy Giuliani.,1
Now, many don't know this, but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes.,1
But, as the saying goes, "If you can't beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.",1
Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
So as I've said, we've now had our third and, thankfully, final debate.,1
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
Sharing a stage with Donald Trump is like, well, nothing really comes to mind.,1
And it's getting worse.,0
To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?,0
Vote for Donald Trump.,0
There is nothing like sharing a stage with Donald Trump.,1
Donald wanted me drug tested before last night's debate.,1
I will fix it.,0
And look, I've got to tell you, I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer.,1
We will be a rich nation once again.,0
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
Now, actually, I did.,1
It's called preparation.,1
National Security begins at the border.,0
And looking back, I've had to listen to Donald for three full debates.,1
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.,0
So let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
And he says I don't have any stamina.,1
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
That is four and a half hours.,1
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
I have now stood next to Donald Trump longer than any of his campaign managers.,1
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.,0
Now, look, I have deep respect for people like Kellyanne Conway.,1
It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl.,0
In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home.,0
He left her on the side of a dirt road.,0
She's working day and night for Donald and because she's a contractor, he's probably not even going to pay her.,1
A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported ... but never was.,0
But I think the good news is that the debates finally allowed Republicans to unite around their candidate.,1
The bad news is, it's Mike Pence.,1
And it's been a long, long campaign.,1
What kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors?,0
That should be one of our highest priorities, shortening the campaigns.,1
And whoever wins this election, the outcome will be historic.,1
We'll either have the first female president or the first president who started a Twitter war with Cher.,1
And if Donald does win, it will be awkward at the annual President's Day photo, when all the former presidents gather at the White House, and not just with Bill.,1
How is Barack going to get past the Muslim ban?,1
Now, Republicans in particular seem frustrated with their nominee.,1
Paul Ryan told the Republican members of the House, you ... you don't have to support the top of the ticket.,1
Either we win this election, or we lose the country.,0
Don't worry about anyone besides yourself.,1
Just do what's in your own best interests.,1
A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.,0
So I guess Donald really has unified his party around his core philosophy.,1
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
And I don't understand their unhappiness.,1
They say Donald doesn't have any policies.,1
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
He has no policies.,1
You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.,0
Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens.,0
It's a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment.,0
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.,0
I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.,0
I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.,0
I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries.,0
I keep hearing that.,1
I'd actually like to defend him on this.,1
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors and special interests.,0
And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
Donald has issues, serious issues.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most,0
Really, really serious issues.,1
And I worry about Donald's go it alone attitude.,1
For example, at his convention, when he said I alone can fix it, you know, in the '90s, I said the same thing about America's health care system and it didn't work out so well for me, either.,1
But speaking of health, Donald has been very concerned about mine, very concerned.,1
He actually sent a car to bring me here tonight.,1
important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
Because if we win ...,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
Actually, it was a hearse.,1
But I ... but I kind of want to just put the information out there, so everybody can draw their own conclusions and you can judge our relative health.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We've each released our medical records.,1
My blood pressure is 100/70.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
His is unbelievably great.,1
My cholesterol is 189, his is presidential.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
In 18 days, we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House.,0
But you have to vote on November 8th.,0
My heart rate is 72 beats per minute, his is the most beats ever, or the least beats ever, whichever sounds best.,1
Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns ... raised from special interests ... and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen, LA Times, and Investor's Business Daily.,0
But Donald really is as healthy as a horse, you know, the one Vladimir Putin rides around on.,1
Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.,0
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, end Common Core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
But ... but I can say without fear of contradiction tonight, that I will be the healthiest and youngest woman ever to serve as president.,1
Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration.,0
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration.,0
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration.,0
But this has really been a strange campaign.,1
You saw it last night.,1
You saw it again tonight.,1
Donald has attacked me for a life in public service and I didn't get that at first.,1
Your companies won't be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration.,0
We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military.,0
I kind of get it now.,1
Our Navy is the smallest it's been since World War I.,0
My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need.,0
This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan, and it will require a truly national effort.,0
As he told Howard Stern, he doesn't like it when women have been around for more than 35 years.,1
But Donald, we have so much more in common than, actually, you may realize.,1
For example, I tried to inspire young people by showing them that with resilience and hard work anything is possible and you're doing the same.,1
A third grade teacher told me that one of her students refused to turn in his homework because it was under audit.,1
And here's another similarity.,1
The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example.,0
The Republican National Committee isn't spending a dime to help either one of us.,1
I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort.,0
So tonight, let's embrace the spirit of the evening.,1
As our fleet is rebuilt, we'll need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need, like welders and pipe fitters and so much more.,0
Let's come together.,1
We will establish 'centers of excellence' in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet.,0
We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania.,0
As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better, we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure.,0
Remember what unites us and just rip on Ted Cruz.,1
I hope you enjoyed my remarks tonight.,1
I said no to some jokes that I thought were over the line.,1
But I suppose you can judge for yourself on Wikileaks in the next few days.,1
Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years ... but instead of rebuilding America, the money was all lost and America's infrastructure is like that of a third-world country.,0
We're also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East, with nothing to show for it.,0
Donald will tell us after the benediction whether he accepts that this dinner is over.,1
He has to wait and see. ,1
Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia.,0
Instead, we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble.,0
But there's nothing funny about the stakes in this election.,1
We defend other countries' borders, invest in their resources, but abandon our own.,0
The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix America's transportation, drinking water, and other vital infrastructure.,0
This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships, proven financing programs, and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy.,0
This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System.,0
My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed "structurally deficient.",0
We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania ... shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.,0
In the end what makes this dinner important are not the jokes we tell but the legacy that we carry forward.,1
It is often easy to forget how far this country has come.,1
And there are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves, or their parents or grandparents, came here as immigrants, made a life for yourselves, took advantage of the American dream and the greatest system that has ever been created in the history of the world to unleash the individual talents and energy and ambition of everyone willing to work hard.,1
And when I think about what Al Smith went through it's important to just reflect how groundbreaking it was for him, a Catholic, to be my party's nominee for president.,1
We are putting Pennsylvania back to work, and we are putting the special interests out of work.,0
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stop the TPP, and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation.,0
Don't forget ... school boards sent home letters with children saying that if Al Smith is elected president you will not be allowed to have or read a Bible.,1
Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA ... a deal supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
Voters were told that he would annul Protestant marriages.,1
70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization.,0
And I saw a story recently that said people even claimed the Holland Tunnel was a se-cret passageway to connect Rome and America, to help the Pope rule our country.,1
Just a few miles from here, there's a very famous bridge that says: "Trenton Makes, The World Takes.",0
Under a Trump Administration, I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again ... and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again.,0
Those appeals, appeals to fear and division, can cause us to treat each other as the Other.,1
Your products will be sent around the world, not your jobs.,0
Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other.,1
And certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourselves.,1
I believe how we treat others is the highest expression of faith and of service.,1
Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries.,0
She's the most corrupt person ever to run for President.,0
She bleached and deleted 33,000 emails ... after a Congressional subpoena ... lied under oath to Congress, lied to the FBI, obstructed justice, made 13 phones disappear ... some with a hammer ... and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing.,0
Now, from WikiLeaks, we've just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance ... more pay-for-play.,0
That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.,0
It's time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,0
I'm not Catholic.,1
One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business.,0
I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated.,0
I'm a Methodist, but one of the things that we share is the belief that in order to achieve salvation we need both faith and good works.,1
We're losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations ... the only people getting rich are the lobbyists, lawyers and special interests.,0
And you certainly don't need to be Catholic to be inspired by the humility and heart of the Holy Father, Pope Francis.,1
I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress.,0
Not only will we end government corruption, but we will end economic stagnation.,0
Or to embrace his message.,1
My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.,0
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities.,0
His message about rejecting a mindset of hostility, his calls to reduce inequality, his warnings about climate change, his appeal that we build bridges, not walls.,1
African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering.,0
The violence is unbearable.,0
Now as you may know, my running mate, Tim, is Catholic and went to Jesuit schools, and one of the things he and I have talked about is this idea from the Jesuits of the Magis, the more, the better.,1
But we need to get better at finding ways to disagree on matters of policy while agreeing on questions of decency and civility.,1
How we talk to each other, treat each other, respect each other.,1
So I've taken this concept of Magis to heart in this campaign, as best as one can in the daily heat, the back and forth of a presidential campaign, to ask how we can do more for each other, and better for each other.,1
Because I believe that for each of us, our greatest monument on this earth won't be what we build, but the lives we touch.,1
And that is ultimately what this dinner is all about.,1
And it's why it's been such a great honor to join you all again.,1
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot.,0
There is no education, there are no jobs, there is no safety.,0
Nearly 3,500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Thank you.",1
I am so excited about being here.,1
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
Thank you, all for this really warm, wonderful welcome.,1
And it's getting worse.,0
To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering, I say: what do you have to lose?,0
Vote for Donald Trump.,0
I will fix it.,0
We will take care of our inner cities, and we will bring safety, prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia.,0
And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us.,1
We will be a rich nation once again.,0
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election, and I am very grateful for her support.,1
I'm also delighted that we're joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace.,1
I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly.,1
And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton [<i>inaudible</i>] for his pledge of allegiance.,1
And thanks to all the elected officials here.,1
National security begins at the border.,0
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders.",0
And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week!,1
It's almost hard to believe, isn't it?,1
There are only seven days left in this election.,1
Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.,0
So are you ready to vote?,1
She even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
So let me state this as clearly as I can.,0
Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days?,1
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate!,1
Patrick, who's been in Congress, will be an independent voice for Florida families.,1
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
And I am so excited to think about what he could do, because unlike his opponent, he's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
Now somebody asked me the other day, 'Why do you keep coming back to Florida?',1
Just look around folks.,1
I mean it is a beautiful, and I have lots of friends, but it's also really important in this election.,1
Florida can decide who our next president is, which will affect the nation and the world.,1
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about what's at stake in this election.,1
Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes.,1
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl.,0
One week from today, we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States.,1
I don't think the choice could be any clearer.,1
In August, Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times, one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home.,0
He left her on the side of a dirt road.,0
I have spent my career fighting for children and families.,1
I have served in the United States Senate, served on the Senate Armed Services Committee.,1
A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported ... but never was.,0
I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice.,1
I represented you as your secretary of state, going to 112 countries, negotiating with friend and foe alike.,1
If I'm elected, we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported.,0
And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country, and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens.,0
Either we win this election, or we lose the country.,0
I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president.,1
A victory in November will be a victory for you, the American people.,0
Now, I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent.,1
And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons.,1
When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them?',1
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
For the next 18 days, you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths.,0
This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People.,0
I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.,0
And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio, and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president.,1
And what he told the crowd ... it was a big crowd at Kent State University ...,1
I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty.,0
I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.,0
I think every voter should hear.,1
I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries.,0
Basically ... his name was Bruce Blair ... he said that, having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker, being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons, he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack, there is no appeal.,1
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors and special interests.,0
There is no veto.,1
And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say, 'We need a president with the temperament, the steadiness, the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons.',1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life.,0
You're going to remember this day.,0
This is a movement like you've never seen before.,0
And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities.,1
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.,0
So when you think about voting, early this week, voting next Tuesday, responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot.,1
So is immigration.,1
Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working, raising their families, as he has suggested he will do?,1
If we win, the change you've been waiting for will finally arrive.,0
I don't think so.,1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
I don't think that's right.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
It's great to be back here in beautiful Naples.,0
In 16 days, we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House.,0
Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war.,1
Early voting begins tomorrow, and you can already get your absentee ballot, so make sure to start voting.,0
Yesterday, I outlined my Contract with the American Voter ... a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy, safety to our communities, and honesty to our government.,0
We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.,1
Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University.,1
One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption.,0
And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico.',1
Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called ... well, but wait a minute, ... he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment.',1
And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died defending our country, simply because that family was Muslim.,1
I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption.,0
And then let's not forget, Trump spent years, years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States, even after the birth certificate was produced.,1
Honestly if this were something new, I think we'd all be asking ourselves, 'Well, what does he have against President Obama?',1
Or what does he have against me?,1
But this is not new.,1
Even as she was preparing to run for President, WikiLeaks emails show, Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme.,0
I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans.,1
And here's what I want you to tell.,1
My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics.,0
Hillary Clinton's goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price.,0
So I have a message today to the voters of America.,0
It's a message for Republicans, Democrats and Independents.,0
I want you to tell your Republican friends, in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan.,1
It's a message for those living in rural America, urban America and suburban America ... because we are all just One America.,0
He said, 'Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world.',1
It's a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests.,0
So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan, better than President Obama ... literally better than anybody, I guess.,1
And my message is this: if we win on November 8th, we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington, D.C.,0
That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First.,0
Hillary Clinton's foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas.,0
And, when you think about it, what he said at the convention, 'I alone can fix it,' runs counter to who we are as Americans.,1
Yet, for all the money spent, all Clinton delivered was death, destruction and terrorism.,0
She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq, Syria and Libya.,0
We work together.,1
So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president.,1
Next, trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia ... she has bad judgment, bad instincts, and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office.,0
Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal ... and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages.,0
Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more ... including Iraq.,0
Now, Iran is emboldened as never before.,0
In the latest insult to America, the government of Iran is demanding "many billions," in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father.,0
But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because ... Any of you see the debates?,1
I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States.,1
Adding to the insult, Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint.,0
And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years?',1
The humiliation for our country never seems to end ... and it's the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries, than in representing the country she lives in.,0
To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33,000 emails, lied to Congress under oath, made 13 phones disappear ... some with a hammer ... and then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times.,0
The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place.,0
The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State.,0
And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out.,1
She's not a diplomat ... she's a grifter, always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash.,0
The Clintons end up with the money, and America ends up with the humiliation.,0
When I am President, America will be respected in the world once again.,0
And so I've been a lawyer, and I've been a first lady, and I've been a senator, and I've been Secretary of State, and I've been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer, and for my entire life I've been a woman.,1
That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba, and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression.,0
And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what he's been doing for 30 years, he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women.,1
And, I've got to tell you, some of what we've learned ... some of this stuff is very upsetting.,1
The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America, and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home.,0
I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university.,1
If you elect me, along with a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military.,0
It's part of my 100-day plan.,0
And if you're above that, it will be debt free, and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it.,1
This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle.,0
But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds.,1
This is a consequential choice, so we've got to talk about something that, frankly, is painful, because it matters.,1
My proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength.,0
This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport, and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast.,0
We can't just wish it away.,1
And a lot of his supporters don't like to hear this.,1
New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola.,0
I don't blame them.,1
New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores.,0
If I were supporting him, I wouldn't want to hear it either, to be honest.,1
With a Republican House and Senate, we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.,0
But I've got to tell you, I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: it's not okay to insult people.,1
It's not okay.,1
And look at what he does.,1
He calls women 'ugly,' 'disgusting,' 'nasty' all the time.,1
He calls women 'pigs,' rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10.,1
Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world," where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.",0
We just heard from Alicia.,1
She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant.,1
Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter.,0
Well, he said she put on some weight and it made him angry, so he called her 'Miss Piggy.',1
A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately, including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class.,0
He called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she's a beautiful Latina.,1
My plan to transform our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history.,0
He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise.,1
Now, he also said, 'This is somebody who likes to eat.',1
It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent.,0
Well, I have to say: who doesn't like to eat?,1
My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty, raise wages dramatically, and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years ... and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days.,0
A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades.,0
I mean, really, can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?,1
Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution.,0
We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee.,0
But you've got to ask: why does he do these things?,1
My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs.,0
Who acts like this?,1
And, I'll tell you who: a bully, that's who.,1
And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down.,1
She knows that Donald Trump doesn't get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends.,1
One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies, like Carrier, simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries. ,0
But what about our girls?,1
When I'm President, if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries, then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States.,0
We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world.,0
What about girls watching all this?,1
1 in 5 American households don't have a single person in that household with a job.,0
What happens to their confidence, their sense of self-worth?,1
Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.,0
We've lost 70,000 factories since China's entry into the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.,0
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
If you've got a daughter, a granddaughter, a sister, a mother, a wife, a good friend, someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America?,1
And what about our boys?,1
A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country.,0
This is not someone we want them looking up to.,1
Not so long ago, I was the mother of a teenage girl.,1
And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable, and I'm doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson.,1
Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite ... they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be.,1
Right?,1
And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school.,1
And sometimes, we only had a few minutes together.,1
But before she'd run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to, I would figure out how was the day.,1
We'd talk about what was on her mind.,1
We will start making things in America.,0
And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them.,1
And we want them to be strong, and we don't want them to feel bad about themselves.,1
And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down ... lifting people up and respecting women.,1
In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country.,1
So, when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson, I am on the same mission.,1
We will be a rich nation once again.,0
I want them to know they're love, they're cared for, they're respected.,1
But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.,0
I want them to develop a good work ethic.,1
Immigration security is national security.,0
Hillary's pledge for "open borders" includes an open border with the Middle East ... meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families.,0
I believe in hard work, and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world.,1
But that's what I want for every child.,1
A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America ... including a plan to review social media postings.,0
We're letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door, and stamping their visas "approved" on the way in.,0
I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families.,1
So let me state this as clearly as I can. ,0
It will be the mission of my presidency.,1
If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.,0
I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers, overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?,1
We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.,0
So I know there's work to be done.,1
We can't do it with just words alone.,1
We've got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified.,1
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders.,0
And yes, we will build a wall.,0
And, oh my gosh, when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women.,1
I'm not going to repeat it.,1
But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women, mistreating women.,1
And I have to tell you, since that tape came out, twelve women have come to say that, 'What he said on that tape is what he did to me.',1
And then we heard his response.,1
What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again, insulting them.,1
He said he couldn't possibly have said those things because the women weren't attractive enough to assault.,1
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.,0
All across our nation, innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country.,0
Kate Steinle was gunned down in her father's arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier.,0
'Look at her,' he said about one woman.,1
'I don't think so.',1
Her killer had been deported 5 times before.,0
90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die.,0
Laura Wilkerson's teenage son, Josh, was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home.,0
About another, he said, 'She wouldn't be my first choice.',1
He's also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed.,1
His body was viciously burned.,0
The examples go on and on and on.,0
Under a Trump Administration, this crime wave will come crashing to an end.,0
That includes the proposal, in my contract, for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation.,0
With a victory in November, everything will change.,0
He said he did that ... he said he did that to 'inspect' them.,1
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:,0
the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
You have 16 days to make this all happen ... but you have to get out and vote, and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan.,0
That was his word ... and he said, 'I sort of get away with things like that.',1
Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter.,0
It will be a government of, by and for the people.,0
And sure enough, contestants have come forward to say, 'Yes, that's exactly what he did to us.',1
For those who feel like they don't have a voice, I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice.,0
Now, as bad as that is, he didn't just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant.,1
He's also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant.,1
Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing.,1
I'm going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation.,0
Some of them were just 15 years old.,1
We cannot hide from this.,1
We've got to be willing to face it.,1
This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady, Michelle Obama, spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trump's words have shaken her to her core.,1
I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people ... not the donors and special interests.,0
And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives, that's brought back painful memories.,1
And for men who would never, ever talk or act like Donald, it's been shocking to see this.,1
He tried to explain it away as 'locker room talk,' well, I'll tell you what, a lot of professional athletes stood up and said, 'Not in our locker rooms.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. ,0
That does not happen.',1
Well, I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man.,1
And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like.,1
You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. ,0
He doesn't look at us and see full human beings, with our dreams and purposes, our own capabilities.,1
And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign.,1
This is a movement like the world has never seen before.,0
Well, he's very wrong.,1
He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country.,1
You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most ,0
important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time. ,0
He has shown us who he is.,1
Let us on Tuesday show him who we are.,1
We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and grandchildren, what we know is right.,1
And you can go down the list of everything he has said.,1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families, he wants to make it even harder.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
That is the issue of urban renewal, and the rebuilding of our inner cities.,0
Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class, and to provide a new deal for Black America.,0
Well, I have a message for him.,1
We're going to fight for affordable childcare.,1
We're going to fight for equal pay for all people.,1
That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities, great education, and high-paying jobs.,0
We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid.,1
My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First.,0
And that's especially true for minimum wage workers ... who ... two-thirds of whom are women, so we've got work to do my friends.,1
Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs, wages and security first.,0
I'm asking today for the honor of your vote, and the privilege to represent you as your President.,0
I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be.,1
Because instead of Donald Trump's dangerous and divisive vision, mine is positive, optimistic, hopeful and unifying.,1
But I can't do any of this without your help.,1
Early voting has already begun.,1
Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not, I will be your greatest champion.,0
I have no special interest, I take no orders from donors or lobbyists ...,0
I work for you, and only you.,0
Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida.,1
Our campaign is about change, optimism, and the future.,0
I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past, and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future.,0
Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together.,1
Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday.,0
Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets, that nothing can ever really change.,0
Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasn't fixed anything ... she's just made it worse.,0
And voting on all the issues that they care about.,1
It may be my name and Donald's name on the ballot but everything you care about, our security, our economy, bringing our country together, the environment, clean water and clean air!,1
Here in Dade City, you can vote every day from now until November 5th, from 7am to 7pm.,1
American politics is caught in a time loop ... we keep electing the same people, who keep making the same mistakes, and who keep offering the same excuses.,0
In fact, right now, the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes' drive away.,1
The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime.,0
Every day I'm out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking.,0
And every day, the same people, getting rich off our broken system, tell us that we can't change and that we can't try anything new.,0
You can go there right after this rally and vote.,1
Because, we need everybody to stand up in this election.,1
And if you have a mail-in ballot at home, send it in when you get home today.,1
Don't wait to send it back!,1
Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers.,1
I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: America's future belongs to the dreamers, not the cynics.,0
Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple... he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting, people of color from voting, that is a lot of people.,1
By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are.,1
And it's time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country.,0
African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation.,0
Now I know here in this county and this larger region, you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump.,1
They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution, and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights.,0
And here is what I want to ask you, I want you to talk with them.,1
Yet, too many African-Americans have been left behind.,0
Ask them what they care about.,1
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty.,0
Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy.,1
58% of African-American youth are not currently employed.,0
Because Donald Trump's economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations.,1
African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population, yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22.,0
In 2015, violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent ... and it's expected to rise 24% in 2016.,0
I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250,000 a year.,1
In the city of Chicago, nearly 3,500 people have been shot since January of this year.,0
The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable.,0
The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years or more.,0
So there could not be, no matter what you care about, a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump, and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days.,1
They've run the school boards, the city councils, the mayor's offices, and the congressional seats.,0
Their policies have failed, and they've failed miserably.,0
We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls, knocking on doors, it really matters, turn out matters.,1
Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved.,1
They've trapped children in failing government schools, and opposed school choice at every turn.,0
The Clintons gave us NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization, two deals that de-industrialized America, uprooted our industry, and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina.,0
This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary's NAFTA, decimating the African-American middle class.,0
Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence.,0
Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation.,0
Here is what I want to leave you with.,1
You know, I feel like so many of you, our country is already great but we can make is greater.,1
The main reason America is great is because America is good.,1
Massive taxes, massive regulation of small business, and radical restrictions on American energy, have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities.,0
Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent ... which will only drive more jobs out of your community, and into other countries.,0
One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration.,0
Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans.,0
No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers.,0
Hillary's pledge to enact "open borders," ... made in secret to a foreign bank ... would destroy the African-American middle class.,0
We are a big hearted, generous people.,1
Not a small minded people.,1
We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people, we push them down, we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign.,1
At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade.,0
Massive, chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs.,0
Just look at what has happened to Baltimore, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and right here in North Carolina.,0
It's the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.,0
But sometimes, the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance.,1
If I'm President, and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico, I will pick up the phone and make a simple call.,0
I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico, I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States.,0
We won't let your jobs be stolen from you anymore.,0
For America, this is one of those make or break elections.,1
It really is in your hands.,1
When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries, we raise wages at home ... meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable.,0
At the same time, my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores.,0
It also includes a massive middle class tax cut, tax-free childcare savings accounts, and childcare tax deductions and credits.,0
I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment, and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods.,0
I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure, the demolition of abandoned properties, and the increased presence of law enforcement.,0
I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th.,1
I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities.,0
are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us?,1
Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need.,0
And I hope, I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference, I want to be your partner as well as your president, I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren.,1
That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better, fairer, stronger America.,1
Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate!,1
The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession ... through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie.,0
Thank you all.,1
I am so excited to be here, what a time to be back in Cleveland.,1
The Indians are going to the World Series.,1
That is after the Cavs won the championship.,1
What a year for Cleveland, you really are "Believe Land.",1
It's time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.,0
Now I, for one, am hoping for a Great Lakes series, I spent a lot of days at Wrigley field as a kid, so that would be a dream come true for me, to have Cleveland and Chicago in World Series, and for us to win Ohio.,1
I want to thank all of the people who are here today because you've heard from some great, great folks.,1
We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans.,0
Then there is the issue of public safety.,0
I want to thank Governor Ted Strickland, our candidate to the United States Senate.,1
I'll tell you, we could really use a Democratic senate to get things done for the people of Ohio and America.,1
I wanna thank Mayor Frank Jackson, County Executive, Armond Budish.,1
Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration.,0
I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system, and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly, equally and without prejudice.,0
I wanna thank my great friend from Youngstown, Congressman Tim Ryan.,1
There will be only one set of rules ... not a two-tiered system of justice.,0
The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws, bleach and delete 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, lie to Congress and the FBI ... put our national security at grave risk ... and not even face so much as a fine.,0
And we need you all in.,1
Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street.,0
We need you all in.,1
You're rallying together and we need to rally together because you know, I really believe we are stronger together!,1
The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable.,0
Anybody watch the debate Wednesday night?,1
We will also police our streets.,0
Well, that was the third and last time.,1
I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace.,0
That I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.,1
Safety is a civil right.,0
I have now spent four and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again, I have the stamina to be president and commander in chief.,1
Really, you -- you just have to be a good cheer when you find yourself in situations like that.,1
The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police.,0
And because I love this country and I believe in the American people, I could feel so clear in my own mind and my heart about what we can do together.,1
I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members, drug dealers, and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods.,0
The reduction of crime is not merely a goal ... but a necessity.,0
We will get it done.,0
The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless, and dangerous, and puts African-American lives at risk.,0
So no matter what he was saying, I just kept thinking of all the people that I have met throughout this campaign.,1
We must work with our police, not against them.,0
On immigration, my policy is simple.,0
And I had the chance to talk about some of the most important concerns on people's minds, what keeps you up at night.,1
And as I said then and as I have said continuously, we're going to invest in the middle class.,1
We're going to invest in you and your families.,1
We're going to make sure we produce enough good jobs with rising incomes that every single person, especially every single young American here today, will have the chance to go as far as your talents and your hard work will take you. ,1
And we're also going to protect our children from gun violence.,1
I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans, by ending illegal immigration.,0
I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs, and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.,0
We are not going to tolerate the kind of gun violence epidemic that has swept this country and results in the deaths of 33,000 people a year.,1
A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws, and suspending refugees, will be re-invested in our inner cities.,0
It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country.,0
Infrastructure will be another major goal.,0
We can come together to meet our challenges, no matter what they are.,1
My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment, of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary.,0
But on Wednesday night, Donald Trump did something no other presidential nominee has ever done.,1
I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations.,0
He refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.,1
Now, make no mistake.,1
These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years, and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure, including water systems, in America's inner cities.,0
School choice is at the center of my plan.,0
By doing that, he is threatening our democracy.,1
He is basically saying hey, we've been around 240 years and we've always had peaceful transitions no matter who won or who lost.,1
My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice.,0
School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time, and I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states.,0
I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job.,0
Look, if you lose an election -- I've lost elections, you don't feel very good the next day, do you?,1
My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities, more affordable 2 and 4-year college, and support for trade and vocational education.,0
Finally, today, my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty, the promotion of family, and support for the African-American church.,0
But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right?,1
And the peaceful transition -- the peaceful transition of power is one of the things that sets us apart.,1
This is just the beginning.,0
Because I will never, ever take the African-American community for granted.,0
It's how we hold our country together no matter who's in charge.,1
You know, I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state and I -- I saw the difference between what we do and what others do, I was in countries where people jail their political opponents or execute them or exile them.,1
Or invalidate elections that they didn't win.,1
That can never be allowed to happen here.,1
I believe that's true no matter who you support in this election, whether or not you support me.,1
Or you support my opponent, together, we must support American democracy and the country that has given every one of us so many opportunities.,1
It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow.,0
And the best way to do that, my friends, is to turn out and vote.,1
The cycle of poverty can be broken, and great new things can happen for our people.,0
[<i>points to an audience member holding a sign</i>],1
But to achieve this future, we must reject the failed elites in Washington who've been wrong about virtually everything for decades.,0
Those are great.,1
That is great.,1
I'm excited because we are well on our way, there is an inspiring story being written right now by people across America, and many of you are getting involved in this election, some of you for the first time in your lives.,1
The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA, and opening our markets to China, would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation.,0
Instead, they brought only poverty and heartache.,0
The people opposing us are the same people who've wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism, more death, and more suffering ... imagine if that money had been spent at home.,0
We now have in America more than 200 million registered voters.,1
That is more than we have ever had in our entire history, and that is really good news for our democracy.,1
More than 50 million millennials have registered.,1
My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world.,0
You know what that means?,1
Young people will determine the outcome of this election, which I think is good news.,1
She tried to build Democracy in Libya, and failed.,0
That means our future is in good hands.,1
She tried to build Democracy in Iraq, and failed.,0
And listen to this, because this is really exciting.,1
She tried regime change in Egypt, and failed.,0
She pressed regime change in Syria, and failed.,0
She tried a Russian Reset that failed.,0
She tried an Asia Pivot that failed.,0
More than 4 million people have already voted.,1
Now, Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III.,0
Including many people right here in Ohio.,1
In fact, in the first four days of in-person early voting here in Ohio, more people showed up to vote than they did at the same time in 2012, in our last election.,1
Finally, our opponents passed a healthcare law, embraced by Hillary Clinton, over the furious objections of the American voter.,0
Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system ... premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona.,0
That is fantastic and it shows how serious people are taking this election.,1
Doctors are quitting, insurers are leaving, and companies are fleeing.,0
Every prediction they made about this law was a lie.,0
If we don't repeal and replace this disastrous law, we will lose our healthcare system forever.,0
So numbers like that remind us that no matter all the negativity that's out there, there is something really exciting happening right now.,1
People are coming together.,1
Democrats, Republicans, independents, all of us to reject hate and division.,1
Now is the time to embrace a New Direction.,0
People are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, to embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, and everyone can contribute.,1
That is my vision.,1
I have a hopeful, optimistic, unifying vision for what our country will be.,1
Because from the beginning, our campaign has been focused on ideas, not insults, on bringing people together, not tearing us apart.,1
I've been very lucky and have led a great life.,0
And I want all of you to know that that is true not only for the campaign, but if I am fortunate enough to be your president, I want you to know, and I want you to tell anybody you know, any friends, or colleagues at school or work, or your neighborhood who may be planning to support the other guy, here is what I want you to tell them.,1
I want you to tell them that I want to be their president.,1
I want to be every single American's president, whether you agree or disagree, whether you vote for me or against me.,1
Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me.,0
I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable.,1
I believe that.,1
And I have seen that happen.,1
I want to be a good listener.,1
I know there are a lot of people here in Ohio who are discouraged, frustrated, even angry about what is going on in their lives, about losing jobs, they are upset about what they see happening around them.,1
I get that.,1
I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C., delivered under budget, and ahead of schedule, creating thousands of jobs, including construction.,0
But I think anger is not a plan.,1
It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world, and a great symbol for our country.,0
We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have here in Ohio.,1
I took two hours to fly into Washington, to cut the ribbon with my children, and then jump on the plane to be here with you.,0
I wanted to be there for my children, who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with, encourage, and support their children.,0
I think that is what the country needs now.,1
And that is what I will try to offer.,1
CLINTON: I am not going to pretend that we can just snap our fingers and solve our problems.,1
That would not be fair.,1
They did a great job on the hotel, and I told them so.,0
It wouldn't be true.,1
Likewise, the workers did a magnificent job -- without them, it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully.,0
The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country.,0
But I know we can make progress together and you deserve something to vote for, not just against.,1
So I want to speak directly to the challenges that a lot of people here in Ohio face, especially when it comes to our economy.,1
You see I believe really simply that when the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
When we build the economy from the middle out and the ground up, not from the top down, we are more likely to provide better lives, better incomes, better opportunities for more Americans.,1
I want to go into the inner cities, the poor rural communities, and the failing schools, and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization.,0
I'm tired of the excuses from our politicians.,0
My opponent has a different perspective.,1
He really believes if you give trillions, that's with a T, trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, to millionaires and billionaires and corporations, everything will work out.,1
I'm tired of being told what can't be done.,0
It's really trickle down on steroids.,1
I'm tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day, but really another decade.,0
Enough waiting.,0
I believe differently that we must invest in working families in the middle class, in small businesses, that will power the economy.,1
And that's what we're going to do.,1
We're going to get the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top who have done pretty well over the last years.,1
The time is now.,0
Now Donald likes to say he's on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story.,1
There is nothing we can't accomplish.,0
There is no task or project too great.,0
He has been buying cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects when he should be buying good American made steel that supports good American jobs.,1
And this is a very important issue here in Ohio because you're one of the largest steel producing states in America so you understand how important this is to support the American steel industry so I'm going to let Donald try to explain himself to the steel workers filing for unemployment.,1
There is no dream outside our reach.,0
Everywhere I go in this country, all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free.,0
But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again.,0
We have to choose the more optimistic path ... we have to choose to believe not in our politicians, but to believe in ourselves and in our country.,0
He has put Chinese steel workers to work, not American steel workers and we're going to change that.,1
If we do that, anything is possible.,0
And for all of his talk about putting America first, he's made his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
I'm asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future.,0
Let's close the history books on the failures in Washington, and let's open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone.,0
Trump's suits were made in Mexico.,1
I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln.,0
They could have been made in Brooklyn, Ohio.,1
Trump's furniture is made in Turkey and it could have been made in Cleveland.,1
Trump barware is made in Slovenia instead of Toledo.,1
And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again.,0
Together, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans.,0
Great polls keep coming in.,0
A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.,0
On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.,0
At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety.,0
We are going to Make America Safe Again.,0
The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens.,0
So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America again?,1
And we also know that he hasn't paid a dime in federal income tax for years.,1
He says that makes him smart.,1
It must be ended.,0
Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose $1 billion in a year in the first place.,1
But what that means is everybody else here, all of us, have paid more in federal income taxes than a billionaire, right?,1
And that means he's contributed zero, zero for our military or our vets, zero for Pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways or investing in clean energy or other ways to help us with new jobs for the future.,1
The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace.,0
Now Tim Kaine and I, we have a different view.,1
Who is looking out for them?,0
We want to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.,1
For every one violent disruptor, there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school.,0
To all our citizens, in all of our inner cities, and all across the country, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you and I will fight for you.,0
The job of a leader is to stand in someone else's shoes and see things from their perspective.,0
Hillary Clinton calls people who don't support her deplorable, and irredeemable.,0
I call anyone who doesn't support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law.,0
Jobs in infrastructure and manufacturing, clean energy, technology and small business.,1
I will be a President for all Americans, and I will campaign for every last vote, in every last community.,0
We are going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens.,0
And I've set some big goals.,1
But to do this, we must work with our police ... not against our police.,0
Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society ... a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent ... share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least.,0
I want us to deploy a half a billion more solar panels by the end of my first term.,1
And enough clean energy to power every home within 10 years.,1
Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values, and lost lives.,0
We're also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-kindergarten education.,1
65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday.,0
The problem is not that there are too many police.,0
And we want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so that every kid gets a world class education.,1
I want us to bring back technical education in high school.,1
I think it was a mistake when we took it out of our high schools.,1
The problem is that there are not enough police.,0
And let's remember, it's at community colleges like this that thousands and thousands of people in our country, of all ages, get such a good start.,1
Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.,0
And I'm going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude.,0
They are the line separating civilization from chaos.,0
Education should lift you up, not hold you back.,1
And we're going to help you, we're going to help you pay back and pay down your loans.,1
Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night.,0
No, it's the poor family living in the inner city ... it's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country.,0
Too many young people are burdened by those debts.,1
It's going to be great to help you pay it back as a percentage of your income, so you're never on the hook for more than you can afford.,1
Who is there to represent these families?,0
Senator Bernie Sanders and I worked on this plan together.,1
Hillary Clinton doesn't want to hear their voices.,0
It's going to help save millions of people thousands of dollars, and you can actually go to HillaryClinton.com/calculator to see how much money you and your family could save with our plan.,1
So I will be their voice, and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country.,0
I also want to do more for apprenticeship programs.,1
I thank all the unions represented here for the great apprentice programs that you have in place.,1
Thank you.,1
People who just want a secure community for their families, good schools for the kids, and a good-paying job to support their loved ones.,0
I want to support apprenticeship programs and skills trainings with business and labor unions, because there are going to be good jobs out there for welders, and machinists, and health technicians, and computer coders, and so much more.,1
We will bring security to our African-American communities, and to our Latino communities.,0
I want everybody to have the chance to get your piece of the American dream, and I think the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
And we're going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty.,1
As I said in the debate the other night, I want to make sure that we take care of people on Social Security who were low-income workers and women, particularly widows, who lose have of their monthly payment when their husbands die.,1
We will also bring school choice, and new prosperity.,0
Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century.,0
We've got to do more to make sure Social Security provides a decent income for our seniors.,1
It's time for change ... it's time for a New American Future.,0
And, yes, don't you think it's finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
Now the equal pay issue is important in and of itself because, if you've got a mother or a wife or a daughter or a sister who's working, you want her to be paid fairly.,1
I mean that's good for the entire family, right?,1
But the equal pay issue gets at something even deeper.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women.",0
We've got to make sure that women and girls are treated with the dignity and respect in our country that they deserve.,1
That she has been "fighting for children.",0
We cannot -- we cannot tolerate the kind of behavior and language we've seen from my opponent.,1
He thinks that belittling women makes him bigger.,1
Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty?,0
Goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know how that feels.,1
So we're going to stand up for everybody, men and women, retirees, the young, millennials, everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.,1
Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare?,0
You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say.",0
And I have said repeatedly that we're going to reform the criminal justice system so that it works fairly for everyone.,1
And we have to address systemic racism that is still too big a part of our lives together.,1
At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions.,0
I want to give credit to all the young people, and really people of all ages, who've been marching and speaking out, doing everything you can to make sure that issues of policing and mass incarceration, environmental justice, economic justice, educational equity, gun violence, voting rights, that they get the attention they deserve.,1
I have employed thousands of women in my company.,0
Because it's important that we lift these issues up and work to make sure that everybody in our country feels like they are seen and they are heard.,1
Women of different backgrounds.,0
And all the advocates and activists who have challenged us to think about these issues of race and justice and equality and opportunity in new and powerful ways really deserve our appreciation.,1
I'm going to do everything I can to lift these issues up, because one of my hopes for my presidency will be to root out systemic racism and bigotry and discrimination in whatever form it takes.,1
Women of many talents.,0
And just last week here in Pennsylvania, I was joined by my daughter, Ivanka, and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.,0
So really, when you think about it, my name will be on the ballot, but it is not just me.,1
We have also talked about improving education, and I will talk about it more tonight.,0
People say, well, she has lots of plans and all of that.,1
A first-class public school education, as well as options for alternatives through charter schools, school choice, and homeschooling, is a right, not a privilege.,0
The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, should be easier to access, pay for, and finish.,0
I do, but I also have a lot of humility about this.,1
Education is the bedrock of our society.,0
Women also value security.,0
I really believe our country is at a turning point, that this is a crossroads election.,1
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders.,0
So yes, my name may be on the ballot, but the question really is, who are we as a country?,1
As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use.,0
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.,0
What are our values?,1
What kind of future do we want to create together?,1
But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs.,0
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use.,0
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders.,0
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.,0
It is so easy to get cynical about politics, believe me, I know that.,1
This must change.,0
But this matters so deeply to our families and our communities and our country, and indeed our world.,1
Every change starts with a conversation.,0
So I want to say something to people who may be reconsidering their support for my opponent.,1
Together, we will have this conversation.,0
And we will make this change.,0
The changes will start immediately.,0
I know you may still have questions for me.,1
I respect that, I want to answer them, I want to earn your vote.,1
On my first day in office, I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses.,0
I am reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents.,1
This will unleash a technology revolution.,0
I think America needs every single one of us to bring our energy and our talents, our ambition to build that better country.,1
America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future.,0
So I hope that as we move through these next 18 days, everyone thinks seriously about what you really want to see, not just in your next president, but in your lives, in your jobs, in your education, in our future together.,1
And the only way we can have that positive, optimistic, unifying future is if all of you help us get there.,1
The next great American invention, the next great improvement to our lives, is right around the corner.,0
All we have to do is remove the red tape.,0
Every phone call you make, every door you knock on, every voter you register makes a big difference.,1
Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history.,0
So I hope you will give whatever time you can for these last days.,1
It's going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses, small and large, making our country a magnet for new jobs.,0
We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution.,0
You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
You can text "JOIN," J-O-I-N, to 47246 to join.,1
With your help, we can elect Democrats up and down the ballot starting with Ted Strickland and others who are running.,1
Oil, coal, natural gas, shale energy, and renewables.,0
This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year.,0
But to be a prosperous nation, we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country.,0
That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors.,0
We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses.,0
Steel jobs, and all manufacturing jobs, will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way.,0
Remember that early in-person voting in Ohio began on October 12th and it ends on November 7th.,1
So you have more of a window to vote than a lot of people in other states.,1
Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization.,0
And I hope you will exercise that.,1
These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton.,0
The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania, stole your jobs, and shipped them to other countries ... we are going to bring them back.,0
Jobs will come flowing back in all over America.,0
And I hope that you will decide whatever issue you care about, you can almost in your mind's eye see that on the ballot, see it next to my name, see it whether you care about climate change and what we are doing to protect the Great Lakes, including Lake Eerie, while creating good paying clean energy jobs.,1
Whether you believe women should be able to make our own health care decisions.,1
If you believe marriage equality should be protected.,1
It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.,0
And that LGBT Americans should be treated equally.,1
If you believe we should do more to stop the opioid epidemic that is destroying lives and communities.,1
That we should do more to help with mental health and make sure that people get the treatment that they deserve. ,1
If you believe we need to get the cost of health care, premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and prescription drug costs down.,1
Today, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.,0
If you believe that we should have a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals toward peace and prosperity.,1
We're going to turn it all around.,0
This is our chance to send a very clear, unmistakable message about what kind of country and future we want.,1
You know, I have two of the most wonderful grandchildren ever, and I see them whenever I can, I FaceTime with them all the time.,1
But I think about them endlessly because I feel such a sense of responsibility, not just because they're my grandchildren, obviously, and I would do anything to help them, but because I want everybody's children and grandchildren to have the same opportunities, to chart your own future, to believe in yourself, to contribute to this great America democracy of ours.,1
There's a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign ... and not mine.,0
To be part on an economy that lifts you up, not drags you down.,1
I am motivated by my work that I've done my entire life on behalf of kids and families.,1
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
From the time I joined the Children's Defense Fund, until today.,1
My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.,0
95% of our donors are small dollar donations.,0
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you ... visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement.,0
Let me tell you what else we're going to do.,0
And I will do whatever I can to make it my mission to give every single person, especially every child and young person, the chance to live up to your God-given potential.,1
Let's go out and prove that love trumps hate.,1
One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education.,0
The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973.,0
Thank you!",1
So we don't get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together.,1
But today was a real opportunity for us. ,1
I just want to make two quick points.,1
But what a lot of people don't know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments.,0
First, as we are traveling in the last 17 days, we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot. ,1
And in particular, as I said today, we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate.,1
These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free, but too many of these universities don't use the money to help with tuition and student debt.,0
We will be, I think, meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight.,1
So we will have a chance to do that with her.,1
Instead, these universities use the money to pay their administrators, or put donors' names on buildings, or just store the money away.,0
I will be doing the same as we go from state to state, as will Tim. ,1
In fact, many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs.,0
The other point is today, we are making our closing arguments.,1
But they should be using the money on the students ... for tuition, for student life, and for student housing.,0
We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts, but we are giving people something to vote for, not just against. ,1
On top of that, the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year, plus another $130 billion on federal loans.,0
Here again, the universities don't use the money to reduce the price of college ... but to increase it.,0
And I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg, one of the most extraordinary places in American history, and basically said, if he's president, he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior. ,1
We have to break this cycle.,0
I'm going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars ... paid for by you ... that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt, and to spend their endowments on their own students.,0
Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president.,1
Another major issue for all American families is healthcare.,0
President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2,500 dollars.,0
Instead, the opposite happened ... the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5,000 dollars during that time.,0
Just one more Washington lie ... like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.,0
As we said in the book, "Stronger To-gether" we have very specific plans. ,1
And we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people.,1
<i>Reporter:</i> Secretary Clinton, Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations.,1
It's a disaster.,0
What do you have to say to that?,1
That is why, on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.,0
We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first.,0
These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts, empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines, and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens.,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> That is just not accurate.,1
Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare.,0
<i>Reporter:</i> We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win, it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform, but rather that they have rejected Trumps.,1
How would you respond to that, and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together, and have a mandate for the presidency?,1
Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants, by making them citizens ... bankrupting these programs for Americans.,0
She doesn't understand how Democracy works.,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me. ,1
Public servants are just that ... they're there to serve you.,0
We have close elections in America.,1
But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests.,0
Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
You can go back and check that out for the last 4, 6, 8 of them.,1
it is not unusual that the election would be close. ,1
So we are not taking anything for granted.,1
We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground. ,1
They're all part of the same political establishment.,0
We have great events planned.,1
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.,0
We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote. ,1
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.,0
As i said in pittsburgh, we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout.,1
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
the 200 million voter registration mark is huge, it's never been reached before.,1
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging. ,1
I Am For America ... and America First.,0
And then what we are seeing from early vote returns, I think we are over 4 million already.,1
So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election, people know what Tim and I want to do.,1
We have been very clear about that.,1
We've laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum.,1
And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle, to everybody that will possibly come together with us.,1
<i>Reporter:</i> Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration?,1
And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda, particularly immigration?,1
Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Amy, I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished.,1
Government will start working again.,0
Fixing things is what I do.,0
I came into the senate in 2000 as you know, and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people. ,1
Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity ... where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.,0
I didn't have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else.,1
We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.,0
That's what I want to do for our country ...,0
I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.,0
I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be.,0
And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with. ,1
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses ...,0
I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.,0
We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be ... all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.,0
We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers ... and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.,0
It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.,0
I think, last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor.,1
You don't get that done unless you work with folks on the other side. ,1
It's that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country.,0
So I have a record of doing that, not just in the senate, but as first lady and secretary of state.,1
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.,0
And people know that.,1
And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together.,1
You have to knock on doors.,0
You have to pick up that phone.,0
Go to our website to learn more.,0
You have to campaign on the streets.,0
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.,0
And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground.,1
<i>Reporter:</i> Madam Secretary, have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win?,1
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.,0
You have 46 days to change the world.,0
You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.,0
Clinton: No I really haven't.,1
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.,0
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
I am a little superstitious about that.,1
Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.,0
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:,0
We have got a transition operation going, and I haven't really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is, and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve.,1
I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists, save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first.,0
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
<i>Reporter:</i> What kind of qualities are you looking for...,1
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> I am not going to talk anymore about that.,1
<i>Reporter:</i> I was wondering, you touched on it earlier at the event, but what would your response be to trump's assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> You know, I debated him for 4.5 hours.,1
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore. ,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
I will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer.,1
He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to.,1
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.,0
He can go off on tangents, he can go to Gettysburg and say he's going to sue women who have made accusations against him. ,1
I am going to keep talking about what we want to do, what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
And actually when it comes right down to it, that is what I think people end up voting on.,1
Thank you all very much.,1
<i>Reporter:</i> Secretary Clinton, are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected?,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
And one other issue, there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference, that's now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme, was a mess of your own making.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
Would you comment on that as well?,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> No, I have nothing to say about Wikileaks, other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election.,1
We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN.,0
We're up five points in Ohio, and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide.,0
I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever.",1
Wow.,1
The people of the United States are ready for change.,0
It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh. ,1
I do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney. ,1
I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland. ,1
They're ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains, disrespects and looks down on hardworking people.,0
The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary, and it's not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers.,1
As special as that is, but to their roots, what they believe in, their values, and their deep concern for future generations.,1
This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C. versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.,0
So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family.,1
For years, our leaders have looked out only for themselves.,0
It means a great deal to both Tim and me.,1
I also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us.,1
Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here.,1
Mayor Bill Peduto.,1
Mayor John Federman.,1
There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint, Michigan.,0
The city of Flint was once known as Buick City.,0
Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer.,1
More than 80,000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 ... today, its less than 8,000.,0
Forty percent of the city's residents are living in poverty.,0
And all the other elected officials, it means a lot for you to be here with us.,1
Violent crime is among the nation's highest.,0
If all goes well in 17 days, we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh.,1
Today I went to Flint, Michigan to address the water crisis.,0
The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government.,0
Some of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania, and I am excited about helping, in any way that we can, for Pittsburgh, Allegheny county, and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together.,1
It's tragic and it's heartbreaking, and it should never happen in the United States of America.,0
This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own.,0
It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.,0
Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.,0
I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine.,1
I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest, toughest, most qualified vice presidents we have ever had.,1
We are going to turn this around.,0
We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people.,0
And I also knew he had never lost an election.,1
I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit.,1
Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him, and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family, I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country.,1
Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses, the dilapidated infrastructure.,0
He is not just smart, tough and qualified, Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet.,1
I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign.,1
This is what our politicians have done to this city, this is what our politicians have done to America.,0
Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country, and particularly here in Pennsylvania.,1
But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities.,0
Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50, 60, 70 years.,0
Their policies have produced massive poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.,0
They've trapped Americans in suffering for years, and I'm running to offer a better future.,0
But both of us, unlike our opponent, do not believe we can do this alone.,1
We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you.,1
Lower crime, better schools, more jobs ... safety, security, opportunity.,0
And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot.,1
Now, I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who aren't planning on voting for me right now.,0
It may not be listed, but it will be on the ballot. ,1
Whether you care about new, good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down.,1
I will campaign hard for their votes ... we can't stay the course our country is on.,0
If you keep voting for the same people, you'll keep getting the same results.,0
What ever it is you care about, it is literally going to be on that ballot. ,1
Now, my name and Tim's name may be the ones on the ballot, but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country.,1
And we're going to need help doing that after the election, and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty, your next senator. ,1
You know, Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer.,1
I think she is one of 10 children, right?,1
I am willing to campaign anywhere.,0
One of 10 children.,1
She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families.,1
I am willing to go anywhere, visit anywhere, even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support.,0
Hillary Clinton calls people who aren't supporting her deplorable and irredeemable.,0
I have known her now for more than 20 years, when she was really young, and I have seen that same can-do spirit.,1
I call people who aren't supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else ... and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote, in every last American community, right up until November 8th.,0
I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat, or that have voted Democrat for generations.,0
She just gets up every day, and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods, to keep our kids and healthy, to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water, to help people make the most out of their own lives. ,1
I am running to be President for all Americans, to represent all Americans, and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence.,0
The economic policies of Hillary Clinton ... on trade, on the economy, on immigration ... have devastated the inner cities of America.,0
Now she is running for the senate, because like Tim and I, she believes our economy should work for everyone, not just those at the top. ,1
Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate.,1
Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution.,0
Hillary Clinton believes in globalism ... taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries.,0
I am not running to be President of the world ...,0
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
I am running to bring hope to Flint, to Canton, and to every party of this country.,0
If we don't break free from our partisan boxes, then nothing will ever change ... it's time to vote for America and America First.,0
Hillary Clinton's refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term.,0
That's enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States.,0
President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions, bringing the total to 110,000 refugees in just one single year.,0
But more importantly, she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate.,1
Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees, we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans.,0
Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life.,0
You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black, white and Latino.,0
We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America, and Katie will help us break through the gridlock, actually make a difference in people's lives, help us create more good jobs with rising incomes, guarantee equal pay for women, defending planned parenthood.,1
And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katie's opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump. ,1
A lot of republicans have.,1
You are moms and dads, children and grandparents, you are from cities small and large and in-between.,0
They have had the grit to stand up and say 'he does not represent me'. ,1
But above everything else, you are all Americans.,0
But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq.,1
He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists, he heard him say terrible things about women.,1
He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasn't really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear?,1
If he doesn't have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this, then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests? ,1
So, you know, when I look at this, I'm thinking to myself, we have work to do in Washington.,1
Hillary Clinton's attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.,0
Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress.,0
And I know it's not easy.,1
I understand we have some real challenges.,1
I believe we can do it.,1
I would not be standing here, Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first, who get up every day thinking about middle-class families, who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college, how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them?,1
There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale.,0
Look at what she did with Russian Uranium, or with UBS bank, or with the contracts in Haiti.,0
How are you going to deal with all of the challenges?,1
That is what I try to do my entire life.,1
That is who you should be electing, people who care about you, your families, your children. ,1
Now, as Tim said, he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday.,1
Well, I will tell you, that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump.,1
Hillary Clinton's record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure.,0
I mean, think about this, I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald, proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief.,1
And after every one of those debates, people have said, how did you do that?,1
Just look at what she did to the Middle East ... in Iraq, in Syria, in Libya.,0
And really, you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that.,1
You are in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 million people.,1
Not to mention her failures in Russia, China and North Korea.,0
One failure after another ... all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street.,0
The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home.,0
So, no matter what he would say, I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign.,1
Just early today I've met Henry over there.,1
Henry is on top of his dad's shoulders, and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president, and you know, I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you.,1
1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.,0
You know, I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me.,1
From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015, people have been telling me what is on their minds, and it is one of the greatest honors. ,1
You know, sometimes it is just fleeting.,1
Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009.,0
And the national debt has doubled.,0
I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.,0
I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line, just running into somebody.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
That begins with a new America-First trade policy.,0
And that person, that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop, looks into my eyes.,1
Hillary Clinton's bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clinton's NAFTA, her support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and her support for the TPP ... she called it the "Gold Standard.",0
Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO.,0
Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.,0
I can tell they are trying to take my measure, and I am grateful that they take their vote, their choice so seriously.,1
I will renegotiate NAFTA, I will defend your jobs, and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America.,0
And then they might say something like, I have a really terrible problem in my family.,1
My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin.,1
America's trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.,0
What are you going to do about it?,1
Or maybe they will say, my brother has schizophrenia, and we can't afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs .,1
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved ... which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance.,0
Or maybe they will say, I am a diabetic.,1
And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin, and I can't afford it.,1
What are you going to do about it? ,1
We won't let that happen.,0
That is the right question to ask anybody running for president, because at the end of the day, this is about you.,1
As I said the other night, we are going to invest in the middle class.,1
But you have to get out and vote.,0
My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.,0
We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.,1
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.,0
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.,0
And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person, especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you. ,1
Now, I've got to say, I believe in hard work.,1
That is how I was raised.,1
I believe you've got to work for what you get in life.,1
But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should.,1
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy.,0
Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.,0
I will fight for you against the special interests, against the corrupt politicians, and against the powerful insiders.,0
For me, that starts by believing in our country. ,1
Let me be your champion.,0
You know, there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many.,1
Do we have problems?,1
In all things, it's time to put Americans first ... and start taking care of each other.,0
We have problems.,1
Do we have challenges?,1
Of course we do.,1
Yesterday, I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.,0
We are human beings.,1
But boy, there is no more blessed place.,1
And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party.,1
He refused to say he would respect the results of this election. ,1
On policy after policy, we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans.,0
I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment [NRA endorsement]; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA ... which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States ... and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.,0
And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States ... not in China, and all over the world.,0
We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again ... like never before.,0
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
We will rebuild our water infrastructure, and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water.,0
Make no mistakes about this, my friends.,1
He is threatening our democracy.,1
Look, I have lost elections.,1
You don't feel very good the next day, believe me.,1
But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship, right? ,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
You know, the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart, and whether you support me or my opponent, together we must show we support American democracy.,1
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us.,1
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote.,1
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now.,1
We have just reached a milestone, more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election. ,1
And you know what?,1
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people.,1
More than ever before.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
I find that a very hopeful sign.,1
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
And here in Pennsylvania, hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012.,1
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
What does this tell us?,1
I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there, something exciting is happening right now.,1
People are coming together -- democrats, republicans, independents -- all to reject hate and division.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And in the states where they can, people are motivated to vote early, to defend core American values, and embrace a future where every person counts, everyone has a place, everyone can contribute.,1
And Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
You see, despite what Donald Trump may think, most Americans really believe we can do better.,1
I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition, the Ohio Oil and Gas Association, and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today.,0
Most Americans really believe women should be respected.,1
Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly.,1
Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans.,0
Let me also recognize my friend, Harold Hamm.,0
It is great to be here in Pittsburgh, the Steel City.,0
Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe. ,1
Under a Trump Administration, we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation.,0
The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election.,1
Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country.,0
It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children.,1
And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters.,1
I want you to know, if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president, we will work with everyone. ,1
Our country desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times ... but which has lifted us up, in the past, to our greatest achievements as a nation.,0
Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west, you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump.,1
Every day, I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country ... and become One American Nation, united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens.,0
And here is what I want you to tell them.,1
We all have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes, see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our wounded country.,0
Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens.,0
I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them, will listen to them, and I want to be their president, too. ,1
Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. ,0
Because whether you agree or disagree with me, whether you vote for me or vote against me, I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable.,1
Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the leader.,0
I have seen that.,1
I know it can happen.,1
How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities.,0
We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate.,0
But there is no right to engage in violent disruption, or to threaten the public safety and peace.,0
And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions.,1
They want to know, how do we move forward better.,1
They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more.,1
Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community.,0
The violence against our citizens, and our law enforcement, must be brought to an end.,0
The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots, are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities.,0
They are upset what they see around them.,1
It is their jobs, housing markets, schools and economic conditions that will suffer ... and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety.,0
There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.,0
Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.,0
I get that.,1
Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace.,0
But anger is not a plan.,1
For every one violent protestor, there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.,0
More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs.,0
Last year, we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
And we need -- we need to work together.,1
We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania.,1
More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone.,0
Nationwide, approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American.,0
I think that is what our whole country needs right now.,1
That's what I will try to do.,1
I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems.,1
That does not happen in the real world.,1
This is a national crisis, and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives.,0
But I know we can make progress together.,1
Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York.,0
The choice we face in this election is stark, especially when it comes to the economy. ,1
The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.,0
Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
And when we invest in working families, in the middle class, in small businesses, we can make the economy work again for everybody.,1
I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective.,1
Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable.,0
They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires, billionaires, corporations, it will all trickle down to everybody else.,1
We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again.,0
I will appoint the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels, gangs and criminal syndicates ... and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country.,0
It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up, and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right.,1
My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority.,0
Married to one, that's right.,1
Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education, and a good-paying job.,0
To have the best schools, and the best jobs, you must have safe communities.,0
That means we must recognize the contributions of our police, who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life, and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent.,0
Worked for one. ,1
We all remember, earlier this year, when officers in Dallas ... hunted down for execution ... continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth.,0
And here is what I know.,1
That when you focus on helping the middle class, you end up lifting everybody.,1
Every day, police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and, every year, many of them will go out on calls and never return.,0
Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public, and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed.,0
But our men and women in blue also need our support, our thanks, and our gratitude.,0
When you focus on helping the top, you help the top.,1
They are the line separating civilization from total chaos.,0
They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror, as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey, and New York, and the off-duty police officer's heroic actions in Minnesota.,0
That is not good enough.,1
In addition to providing safety, we must provide economic opportunity.,0
That begins with school choice, and leads to a secure job with a rising income.,0
Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers, but his actions tell a different story.,1
Yes, he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects.,1
This brings us to the subject of energy.,0
He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs.,1
Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again ... especially for the poorest Americans.,0
I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work, instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania.,1
And for all his talk about putting America first, he has made many of his products in 12 different countries.,1
America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy ... some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy, oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands, in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves.,0
It's all upside: more jobs, more revenues, more wealth, higher wages, and lower energy prices.,0
I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy, and allow this wealth to pour into our communities ... including right here in Pennsylvania.,0
So if he wants to make America great again, why doesn't he start by making things in America?,1
According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on American energy, including shale production, will accomplish the following:,0
increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually,0
And we now know -- we now know he hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes for years.,1
add over 500,000 new jobs annually,0
He says that makes him smart.,1
increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,0
Well, I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place.,1
increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades,0
Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business? ,1
Never could figure that out.,1
increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.,0
In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama ... creating countless more jobs in the process.,0
Overall, my entire economic plan ... tax reform, regulatory reform, energy reform, and trade reform ... will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years, assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent, and I believe we will reach 4% growth.,0
But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has.,1
That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks. ,1
I will tell you what.,1
My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate, for small and large businesses, down from 35 percent today ... turning America into a jobs magnet.,0
Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent.,0
It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military, zero for our vets, zero for pell grants to help young people go to college, zero for our highways, zero for everything.,1
Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3, and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut ... including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts.,0
And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America.,1
Well it's unfair and it's wrong.,1
My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations, and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety.,0
With your help, we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure.,1
Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year.,0
On energy, my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas, and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow.,0
Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our water systems all need help, and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done, jobs that can't be exported out of Pennsylvania.,1
Finally, my plan includes a renegotiation of America's trade deals, and the enforcement of trade rules, to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States.,0
Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term.,0
I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States.,1
It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history.,0
That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses, universities, and community colleges. ,1
Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries.,1
Compare that to my opponent.,0
Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing.,1
We invented both of those technologies.,1
We should take the lead and we should have the jobs. ,1
She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike, massive new regulations, the offshoring of American jobs, and the aggressive restriction of American energy production.,0
We are also going to fight climate change with clean, renewable energy jobs.,1
And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America.,1
And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits.,1
Don't let anybody fool you, my friends.,1
assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class. ,1
It is time to say loudly and clearly, right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America.,1
So, I have set some big goals.,1
Her plan will help only her wealthy donors, and global special interests, who benefit from the rigged system.,0
I am excited about what we are going to do.,1
Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work, ban hydraulic fracturing in most places, and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas.,0
This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy.,0
Her plan hurts states like Colorado, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources.,0
She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace.,0
And it's all going to put people to work right here.,1
According to the Wall Street Journal, "Overall, more than a dozen [fossil fuel] projects, worth about $33 billion, have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012, with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo.",0
Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington, a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast, and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility, among others.,0
Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda.,0
And sometimes folks say to me, how are you going to get that done?,1
The platform produced by Hillary Clinton's party this year also calls for a "price on carbon.",0
That's just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production ... a tax on American consumers.,0
And remember, every energy dollar that isn't harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country ... often foreign countries not very friendly to us.,0
That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries, but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards.,0
That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of America's vast energy reserves.,0
You go to the congress ...well first of all, I hope we will elect some or democrats.,1
We need an America-First energy plan.,0
This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies.,0
That will be job number one.,1
Number two, I think it will be a very simple question.,1
Our members of congress, members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich, the powerful, and the wealthy, or on your side?,1
The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country, bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions ... more jobs, higher wages, a larger tax base, and dollars flowing into our country for a change, instead of out of our country.,0
Hillary Clinton's war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars.,0
And you know what?,1
They are going to have to answer that question.,1
She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production ... which supports 10 million jobs in the United States.,0
Because if they stay beholden to the special interest, if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate.,1
Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry, which supports 40,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.,0
I have seen it.,1
I know it.,1
If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America, then I want to make sure that they don't come back to Washington after the next election.,1
We are in a great, great high school here, and I am so proud to be here.,1
And so, we are going to be a good partner with education, especially with educators.,1
We are going to start with universal pre-k. We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education. ,1
And I want us to bring technical education back to high school.,1
I think it was a mistake when we took it out. ,1
There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in today's economy -- coming out of high school, maybe going to community college, going into an apprenticeship program, and I want to lift up that work.,1
We have just begun, as a nation, to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy.,0
A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life. ,1
The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families.,0
We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
And we are going to help you pay down your college debt.,1
At the same time, this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel.,0
But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically, and energy production in general.,0
Currently, less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development.,0
It's going to be great.,1
To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job, so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford.,1
Almost 90% of our nation's offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production.,0
I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders, and it's going to help save -- it's going to help save people thousands of dollars. ,1
In fact after a year, maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save.,1
We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you. ,1
Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources.,0
That means we will end the war on coal.,0
I mean, ultimately it's pretty simple.,1
I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.,0
We will eliminate the highly-invasive "Waters of the US" rule, and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan ... these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate.,0
I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air, and clean, safe drinking water for all Americans.,0
I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats.,0
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream. ,1
My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation, not those with radical political agendas.,0
So, there's a lot of work we are going to be doing.,1
It will be a future of conservation, of prosperity, and of great success.,0
We need to raise the national mini-mum wage.,1
It will be a future of new technology, new innovation, and new solutions.,0
People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty.,1
It will be a future we can achieve together, beginning with a victory on November 8th.,0
We are, as Tim said, going to guarantee equal pay for women.,1
We Will make America Wealthy Again.,0
You know, look, it's not just a woman's issue.,1
If you have a mother, which all of us do -- if you have a mother, a wife, a daughter, or a sister who's working, it's your issue.,1
It's good for the entire family, it's good for our economy. ,1
So my friends, there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days.,1
Because we have got to get the word out.,1
We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important.,1
We Will make America Safe Again.,0
And that's where all of you come in.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.,1
<i>Audience Member:</i> Nope!,1
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Well, you may.,1
Come November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
We are going to bring back your jobs.,0
You know, I hope you will stage an intervention.,1
And I do hope you will talk about, you know, the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign. ,1
We are going to cut your taxes.,0
We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals.,0
You know, we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning, whatever issue you care about, it's going to be on the ballot.,1
I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country.,1
I care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement. ,1
And, boy, do I care a lot about our constitution. ,1
And maybe it's because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state.,1
And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values.,1
And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
Over the weekend, there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City, and in New Jersey.,0
And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did, as our parents and grandparents did, because maybe they came from somewhere else where they weren't treated right.,1
These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country.,0
Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law. ,1
You know, every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent, meaning me, I think to myself, you know, we don't do that in America.,1
We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary. ,1
Or, you know, when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on. ,1
You know, I get criticized by the press.,1
Attack after attack ... from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando ... we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger.,0
So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security.,0
I know that is part of our democratic system.,1
We believe in a free press.,1
And boy, if you go to countries where there isn't one, you will understand why that is so important. ,1
And when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders, a country founded on religious freedom.,1
My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency.,0
As Secretary of State, she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldn't take them back.,0
You have to ask yourself, who is going to conduct the test?,1
Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110,000 refugees, and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
Are we going to get a quiz?,1
What if the border security official does not believe you?,1
Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term ... with no effective way to screen or vet them.,0
Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs.,0
This isn't just a matter of terrorism, but also quality of life.,0
We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country.,0
Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion? ,1
And if you haven't seen it yet, I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr. Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out.,1
My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States.,0
I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day ... and I will never waver in that sacred obligation.,0
You remember, he pulled out a constitution at our convention.,1
And he reveres our constitution.,1
And for good reason.,1
It's just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering.,0
Since 9/11, hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States.,0
Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders.,0
Because he, too, came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of. ,1
This is unacceptable.,0
Altogether, there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed.,0
In the 20th Century, the United States defeated Fascism, Nazism, and Communism.,0
So, whatever issue you care about, this is an issue that will be decided by this election, and that is why I'm reaching out to republicans, democrats, independents, everyone.,1
I know if we bring our talent, our energy, and our ambition to the work of building our country, we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us, and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I hope you will say you voted for a better America.,1
So, here we go.,1
Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
Yet, my opponent won't even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
In fact, Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists.,0
She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign ... many of them cops and soldiers ... deplorable and irredeemable.,0
Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam, or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas?,0
Just remember -- you've got to get out and vote, you've got to get everybody you know to get out and vote.,1
If you do not know where to vote, please go to iwillvote.com.,1
Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable?,0
You can put your information in and, it is the magic of the internet.,1
In many countries overseas, non-believers face the death penalty ... where is Hillary's condemnation here?,0
They will tell you where you are supposed to vote.,1
Let's ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views, and support the oppression of non-believers, would you call deplorable or irredeemable ... or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?,0
America can never elect a President, like Hillary Clinton, who apparently, with her choice of words, thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists.,0
You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country.,0
Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President.,0
The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction.,0
Our system of government is the best in the world and, as your President, I will defend our values ... and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way.,0
It's also time to remember one very important word: accountability.,0
Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246.,1
All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clinton's watch.,0
And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days, I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come. ,1
Her policies in Iraq, Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS.,0
Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us.,0
Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq, her push for regime change in Libya and Syria, her open borders policies ... these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster.,0
There are a lot of people here -- as I said, whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants.,1
So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure.,0
Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool, demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying.,0
My grandfather, Hugh Rodam, came as an immigrant, as a young boy and settled in Scranton.,1
And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills, he went to work in his teens, he worked there until he retired at the age of 65.,1
When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides "aid and comfort," to the enemy, we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office.,0
He believed in our country.,1
He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work.,1
Her comments are not only reckless, but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks.,0
That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again.,1
We are going to unleash the talent, the innovation, the energy that brought people like my grandfather here, but which we will harness for the future.,1
Don't let anybody tell you America's best days are behind us.,1
ISIS is torturing, murdering, executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide.,0
And what is Hillary Clinton's suggestion?,0
Don't believe that for a minute.,1
We are going to pull together.,1
We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism, respect for each other, bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again.,1
Help us.,1
Help us create that kind of future, and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate. ,1
Thank you all.",1
Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it?,1
Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate?,1
I've known Ted a long time.,1
That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers.,0
I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger, it will only increase and embolden the danger ... just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State.,0
He is a champion for workers and families.,1
He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages.,1
And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done, breaking through the gridlock in Washington.,1
The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clinton's foreign policy legacy.,0
And this is important: unlike his opponent, Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes, displace millions, and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country.,0
How is this a smart policy?,0
Hillary Clinton's decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today ... and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores.,0
We must stop the massive inflow of refugees ... which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase.,0
I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials, including my friend, the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, from across the river in Kentucky.,1
And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today.,1
We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur.,0
Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants, extreme views about religion ... such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith... are commonplace.,0
I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work, to do everything they can to help save lives in America.,1
It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here, and to become part of our incredible home.,0
You know, as Gabby says every day when she goes out, fight, fight, fight.,1
Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule, and it's one more reason why she can never be President.,0
And fight she does.,1
It's time to break with the corruption, the bad judgement, and the failures of the past.,0
She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together ... to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children, our fellow men and women, our country.,1
And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans, including a majority of gun owners, to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures.,1
It is time to have a new American Future.,0
And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner.,1
We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values.,0
You know, you go through life, you go through the campaigns, there are ups and there are downs.,1
We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas, and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism.,0
And my mother, who had a really difficult life, she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign.,1
This will not only require military warfare, but also financial warfare, cyber warfare, and ideological warfare.,0
Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up.,1
But to win this struggle, we need to be strong at home.,0
We are going to rebuild our country.,0
And throughout this campaign, I have stayed focused on one thing: you ... your lives, your families, the problems that keep you up at night.,1
And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities.,0
Because that's really what this election is all about.,1
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six.,0
58% of African-American youth are not working.,0
Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year.,0
It's not about the noise and the distractions.,1
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
It's about what kind of country we want for our kids, and what kind of president can help get us there.,1
I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America.,1
And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election.,1
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.,0
The schools are failing, the jobs are leaving, and millions are trapped in poverty.,0
To the African-American community, I say: vote for Donald J. Trump.,0
Now, earlier today, I was up at Kent State, a great university, and I told them about some of the reasons why I think it's really important to get everybody out to vote in this election.,1
I will fix it ...,0
But I started by saying that there's this new email story about ... why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go.,1
That's a really good question.,1
But I want you to know ... look, I've said repeatedly I made a mistake, I'm not making any excuses, but I will tell you this.,1
I will bring back your jobs, I will fix your schools, and I will fight for you as no one ever has before.,0
It is time for a new civil rights agenda, one that promises safe communities, great education, and good-paying jobs.,0
My whole life has been about creating jobs.,0
If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers, by all means, go ahead, look at them.,1
Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs ... just look at upstate New York, and her terrible trade deals.,0
And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year, right?,1
Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through.,0
It wasn't even a close call, and I think most people have moved on.,1
They're looking and focused on, okay, who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?,1
The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70,000 jobs ... instead, we lost 100,000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled.,0
Next, Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.,0
I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal ... and if we don't get the deal we want, I will walk away.,0
Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year ... this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton.,0
But we are going to turn it all around.,0
Did any of you see the debates?,1
Any of you see the debates?,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.,0
Well, I am ...,1
I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to create American energy independence; I'm going to make our government lean, responsible and efficient; I'm going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;,0
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
I got a little bit of a chance.,1
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing onto our shores.,0
But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service, my plans for our country, what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do, and then weigh that against my opponent, what he's done and said.,1
I am running against someone who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
He actually said, "Then why are we making them?",1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
He's mentioned Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
Now, if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas, remember this.,1
I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues.,0
We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.,0
Our campaign is about ideas.,0
When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because, and I quote, "I have a very good brain.",1
He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do.,1
[<i>Booing.</i>] No, Donald, you don't.,1
And of course, the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia, Vladimir Putin, and their allies.,1
So in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election.,1
We're about solutions.,0
I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.,0
I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.,0
Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things.,0
I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.,0
Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.,0
I have to tell you, it does not give me any pleasure saying that.,1
We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people.,0
It's not a small thing.,1
Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.,0
I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president, both Republicans and Democrats.,1
And look, I've had my disagreements with Republicans.,1
Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.,0
I might have disagreed on policies or principles, but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office.,1
Donald Trump is different, and that's why there is so much at stake in this election.,1
That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids.,0
We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone.,0
He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart.,1
These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force.,0
Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand, and that was over the greatest of challenges ... the challenge posed by slavery ... and we fought a civil war.,1
But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today, the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together.,1
Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.,0
For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense ... even more than housing.,0
I will tell you this.,1
I want to bring not just Democrats, but Republicans and Independents, people who vote for me and people who vote against me, together.,1
Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area ... and my opponent has no childcare plan.,0
Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster ... a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home.,0
Because I have a very different vision of America.,1
Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive.,1
There is no financial security.,0
It's big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight.,0
Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.,0
It is about lifting people up, not putting them down.,1
The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America ... including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians ... to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.,0
They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13.,0
It's a vision that says, and I believe this with all my heart, we are stronger together.,1
And America is great because America is good.,1
Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families.,0
Never forget that.,1
Yes, we have our flaws; of course, we're only humans.,1
The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.,0
Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions,0
to their families and to our society.,0
But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world.,1
So we want an America where women are respected ... where our veterans are honored ... where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly.,1
Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.,0
And we believe in an America where marriage is a right, and discrimination is wrong.,1
For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate.,0
An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values, where everyone counts, everyone has a place, and the American dream is big enough for everybody.,1
Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax ... a major relief for low-income parents.,0
This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.,0
Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account.,0
So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher.,1
When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security, I was really struck.,1
Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free.,0
Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans ... you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them.,0
Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.,0
The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities.,0
Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year ... they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury.,0
It was a very big crowd, and it was primarily students.,1
And I thought to myself, well, I'm not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security.,1
And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair, a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys.,1
Instead, the funds rollover ... so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.,0
A launch officer.,1
And he came out for me, along with now more than 30 launch officers, and basically they said, we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never, ever be near the nuclear codes and keys.,1
These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms,0
And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother him.,1
"Good luck.,1
I outlined last week.,0
The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18.,0
Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.,0
For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds ... if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match.,0
To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.,0
Enjoy yourselves, folks," is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.,1
I wonder if he even knows that a single ... a single ... nuclear warhead can kill millions of people?,1
These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.,0
That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should, and I quote, "not have his finger on the button.",1
And when it comes to handling a crisis, we've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation ... when he's gotten a tough question from a reporter, or when he's challenged in a debate, or when he sees a protestor at a rally, when he's confronted by his own words.,1
Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions.,0
The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.,0
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.,1
But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities.,0
We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.,0
In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button ... including services like nanny-sharing.,0
[<i>Cries of "No!,1
"</i>] Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.,1
Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents.,0
I hope you'll think about that when you cast your vote in this election.,1
Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well.,0
This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time.,0
Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world, and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren.,1
And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America.,1
Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services.,0
Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.,0
Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave.,0
This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing.,0
By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit.,0
This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.,0
There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.,0
As Gabby knows so well, 33,000 Americans a year are killed guns.,1
On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings.,0
Thousands more are injured.,1
Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.,0
These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President.,0
It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together ... not as Republicans or Democrats ... but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.,0
It's an average of 90 people a day dying.,1
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love,0
your families, and want a better future for all Americans.,0
Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes.,1
It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people.,0
We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters, little children killed in their classrooms, clubgoers massacred in Orlando, nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston, South Carolina.,1
It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.,0
It is time to Believe In America.,0
Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.,0
And we've seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence, which is now the leading cause of death for young black men.,1
We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.,0
And when we think about that, we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others.,1
I've had the great honor of getting to know their mothers, who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement.,1
And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone.,0
In particular, I wanted to thank our host, Tony Perkins, for his years of leadership.,0
But here's what I want to say.,1
If anything else in our country were killing as many people, people of good faith, people who believe, like we do, in the Second Amendment, people who own guns, people who go hunting, people who are collectors, we would say, hey, wait a minute.,1
This can't go on.,1
We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole, close the online loophole.,1
[,0
And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time.,1
And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists.,1
If you are too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun, period.,1
And look.,1
And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana, where two weeks ago I spent some time, and I saw some incredible, incredible people.,0
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you!,0
MR. TRUMP: Thank you.,0
There is a very clear difference.,1
[,0
Donald Trump won't stand up to the gun lobby.,1
He's sold out to them.,1
One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time I've spent with the evangelical community.,0
In fact, the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group, more than $7 million in Ohio alone.,1
And in return, Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obama's actions to strengthen criminal background checks.,1
And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible, I have to tell you.,0
Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol.,1
[,0
A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals.,0
I got the evangelicals.,0
He's even said, on his very first day in office, he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms.,1
[,0
How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?,1
So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years, which is why they are running all of these ads against me.,1
And I will stand up to them as president.,1
There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States.,0
[,0
True.,0
So true.,0
I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because we've got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives.,1
I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you, whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people, to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
I've witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land, gotten to know so many people.,0
That's how I was raised.,1
I saw it during my trip to Louisiana, where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need.,0
I was raised to believe that if you work hard ... and I believe in hard work ... you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America.,1
And I will never ever quit on you.,1
Franklin Graham is an example.,0
When I tell you I'm going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life, I don't care what the political or other barriers are.,1
He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana.,0
[,0
He's a great man.,0
We're going to find a way over, under, around, or through until we get it done.,1
I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now.,1
Remember, when our opponents go low, we go high.,1
It's that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country, which is in serious, serious trouble.,0
[,0
We're not going to be distracted.,1
We're not going to be knocked off course.,1
Yet, our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith.,0
And you understand that.,0
We know how much this election matters.,1
All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in today's media environment.,0
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right!,0
And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count.,1
MR. TRUMP: It is right, isn't it?,0
Now, the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple.,1
They've announced it.,1
[,0
Their strategy is: get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, and get people of color to stay home.,1
[,0
It's all part of his scorched-earth campaign, but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it.,1
And it goes against everything we stand for.,1
Your values of love, charity and faith built this nation.,0
So if you're as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run, the things he has said, insulting not just women but immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, prisoners of war, Muslims, veterans, the military ...,1
I mean, the list goes on and on.,1
It's almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does.,1
So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history.,1
[,0
One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you, to a large extent.,0
And Hillary Clinton, you can forget about her.,0
We need more Americans to vote.,1
[,0
And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because we're already seeing record turnout.,1
Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election.,1
So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration, our Christian heritage will be cherished, protected, defended, like you've never seen before.,0
And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio.,1
There is no doubt if we vote, we win.,1
So, please, if you haven't voted early, please do so.,1
And please get your friends and your family, everybody you know to vote.,1
Take people to vote with you.,1
[,0
I believe it.,0
Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there.,1
Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun.,1
And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because, make no mistake, whatever issue you care about ...,1
And you believe it.,0
I've only mentioned a few tonight, but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot.,1
Now, it may be my name and my opponent's name, but where we stand on these issues, what we've done in the past, what we have said we want to do in the future, that is all on the ballot.,1
And you know it.,0
You know it.,0
The future of our economy is at stake, of our education system is at stake.,1
Fighting climate change and clean, renewable-energy jobs are at stake.,1
LGBT equality is at stake.,1
And that includes religious liberty ... remember, remember.,0
[,0
Stand up if you're member.,0
Equal pay for women is at stake.,1
Actually, in the end, the American dream itself is at stake.,1
That's good.,0
So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th. ,1
<i>Audience Member:</i> Happy.,1
That was a great ... that was an amazing experience.,0
[,0
In my remarks, I spoke about how African American church ... and this is all across the country ... for centuries have been the conscience of our nation.,0
<i>Secretary Clinton:</i> Happy.,1
Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history, leading us all to a better future.,0
Very true.,0
Amazing.,0
This was such an amazing experience.,0
I think that's the right answer.,1
But just suppose, just suppose you go to bed early.,1
Suppose you go to bed early.,1
Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didn't make calls or knock on doors.,1
[,0
I want you to imagine.,1
It's the power to heal.,0
It's the power to unite.,0
So you get up early on the morning of the 9th.,1
And you log on to the news to find out, hey, what's going on, or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio, and you hear. ,1
It's the power to make all of us live better lives ... all of us.,0
<i>Audience Member:</i> No!,1
[,0
I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what we're for, not what we're against.,1
But I also think it's prudent to imagine what could happen if we don't do our part.,1
And when in the future somebody asks you, maybe your kids or your grandkids, 'What did you do when everything was on the line?',1
Our nation today is divided.,0
I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.',1
Nobody likes to say it, but we're living in a very, very divided nation.,0
It will be our faith in God and his teachings, in each other, that will lead us back to unity.,0
Let's go out and, in these next eight days, do everything we can to make it clear we're going after the kind of future that includes everybody.,1
We're going to build this economy: new jobs, rising wages.,1
We're going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt.,1
[,0
We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids.,1
Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together, united in common purpose and in common values.,0
So if we build that future together, we will be able to say we were part of making sure that America's best days are still ahead of us.,1
And we will prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all.",1
So let's talk today about some of the things ... and these are great things ... that we can do together to create the American future for everybody, not just a certain group of people, but for everybody.,0
Oh, it is so wonderful to be here on this college campus, and to see so many young people here as Maggie and Elizabeth and I were walking up to the stage.,1
The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back.,0
It's been taken away.,0
[,0
And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows, and we're glad that you've got the best view of what we're doing here. ,1
If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so.,0
It's also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime, and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed ...,1
I saw it yesterday in North Carolina, I saw it the day before in Ohio, it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at what's at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign.,1
If they want to do it, they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.,0
All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings ... [,0
And I will repeal the Johnson amendment ... [,0
[,0
And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.,1
In New Hampshire, you have a lot of reasons to vote ... you've got great candidates for Congress, Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter, who deserve your support, and you've got a great candidate for governor, Colin Van Ostern, thank you!,1
Thank you.,0
I know that Maggie, and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose, but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governor's race, and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House, and boy, it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day.,1
I know these women, and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.,1
Now, Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street.,1
And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again! ,1
That's so important.,0
And I must tell you from the heart, this started, a building of mine in Manhattan.,0
But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers.,1
I had 50 pastors in a big conference room.,0
And we actually had 50 pastors, two rabbis, a couple of priests.,0
We were all talking.,0
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse we've seen from Wells Fargo.,1
And we were there for two hours.,0
And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies, by banks and others. ,1
And at the end, it was a love-fest.,0
In fact, I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator.,1
We all agreed.,0
It was like a love-fest.,0
And I said to them ... we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue ... and I said to them I'd love your support.,0
She is refusing... refusing to let them off the hook, and she is not just speaking for herself, is she?,1
And I know when I can get support.,0
She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up.,1
And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.,1
I know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but ...,1
I'm quite sophisticated.,0
[,0
I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said, he is tweeting away.,1
She gets under his thin skin like nobody else.,1
Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns, she exposes him for what he is ... temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States.,1
And I said I really would like your support.,0
And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire.,1
You do not have to take my word or Elizabeth's word.,1
And they didn't really know what I was talking about.,0
And I said, what's going on here?,0
They said, well, sir, we can't do that because we would be violating the laws.,0
And I said, what's the punishment?,0
Look at what she has already done.,1
Well, we could lose our tax-exempt status, which, of course, is a, you know, massive penalty.,0
I said, tell me about this.,0
And we sat down.,0
They talked about it.,0
Under Maggie's leadership, New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.,1
When did it happen?,0
1954 or so.,0
Lyndon Johnson was having problems ... powerful guy.,0
I actually, as just own way ... you have to gain respect for what he was able to do.,0
Can you imagine that this man single-handedly ... he was having problems with churches.,0
And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time, maybe for very good reason.,0
And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking, under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status.,0
So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk.,0
During her governorship, it was ranked as the best state in the country for business, and she has done it the New Hampshire way.,1
And I said, so, folks, what you're telling me is those people walking way, way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do, because they're allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty.,0
She has brought people together, Democrats and Republicans, and Independents, and I think she has the biggest legislature, probably in the world, that she has to deal with.,1
So she has really honed her skills ... listening and trying to work with people, and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night.,1
And one of the pastors, who I knew very well ... and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just ... and magnificent hearts, much more importantly ... they looked at me and they said, that's actually right.,0
They have more power than we do.,0
From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs , to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health, to raising wages for hard working families.,1
What I love about Maggie is that she is independent, she knows how to find common ground, and how to stand her ground.,1
And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.,1
Because we've got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington.,1
We have to get back to listening respectfully.,1
We can disagree without being disagreeable.,1
And that is why we need leaders like Maggie, and unlike her opponent, she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
We're not allowed to express.,0
And that's what I said.,0
We have to start thinking about this.,0
She knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter.,1
So I hope in these next 14 days, you do everything you can to support her.,1
And I want to say a word about Colin, who I have also known for a number of years now.,1
And I thought about it.,0
And Maggie is leaving some big shoes.,1
And then we had a large group of pastors again.,0
I said I have thought about it.,0
If I become president, we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment.,0
She does not look like it, but she is, she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor.,1
We are going to do that.,0
And it's not going to be hard.,0
Colin is the person for that job.,1
It's not going to be hard.,0
[,0
You know as a member of Executive Council, and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.,1
He helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire.,1
When you ... when you think, from the standpoint of political, you have more than men ... let's say men are 50 percent, women are 50 percent.,0
You're much more than 50 percent, added together.,0
And I actually believe that's one of the reasons why you haven't seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship ... like our polls have been going in the last four weeks, a rocket ship, right?,0
Against his opponent by the way, and he has showed that he will stand up for women's health 100 percent of the time, not just when it is politically convenient.,1
He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50,000 granted stators. ,1
And Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state.,1
And he will fight to put into action the promise of higher education within reach for more families.,1
So please during these next days, make sure you're doing everything you can for Colin, for Carol, and for Annie. ,1
[,0
The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week, they've been stopped from talking and speaking by a law.,0
And we're going to get rid of that law and it's going to get rid of ... we're going to get rid of it so fast.,0
Now did anybody see the last debate?,1
I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving once again, I have the stamina to be president.,1
I've tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about, starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country, because I take it really seriously.,1
And I'm so proud to say ... honestly, I don't want to take credit, but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second.,0
I am so proud ...,0
I think that the problems that keep you up tonight, that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead, of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids, those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to, pay attention to and come up with solutions for.,1
I was just telling this to Tony ... to say that was my idea.,0
I figure it's the only way I'm getting to heaven, so this is going to be very ... [,0
So, you know, I do have a lot of plans, I do.,1
And I get criticized for having so many plans.,1
[,0
So important.,0
Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book ... oh, there's one copy right there!,1
I hope ... which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th.,0
You cannot ... you didn't vote four years ago.,0
You didn't vote.,0
It's called ... oh, another copy!,1
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did.,0
It's called 'Stronger Together,' and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if we're so honored as to be president and vice president.,1
And, you know, I do have this old-fashioned idea that if I'm here asking for your vote to be your president, I should tell you what I'm going to do, and maybe, as I said yesterday in North Carolina, maybe it's a bit of a women's thing because we make lists.,1
We do, we make lists and we try to write down what we're supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week.,1
And so, I want you think about our plans are as our lists ... our lists as a country.,1
We are going to get our economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
We are going to make college affordable.,1
MR. TRUMP: You did?,0
Well, you did.,0
We are going to lower prescription drug costs, and we're going to do everything we can to keep faith with what we have said we're going to do.,1
What a novel idea!,1
A few of you did.,0
[,0
We're actually going to try to deliver results for you.,1
I look at the stats.,0
You didn't vote.,0
But this time you really have ... and this is your last chance.,0
This is it.,0
I mean, we'll never have this opportunity again.,0
So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up ... your family and your friends, and get out and vote, OK?,0
But I got to tell you.,1
During that debate, Donald said something.,1
Well, he said a lot of things that were troubling, but he said something truly horrifying.,1
He became the first person running for president ... Republican or Democrat ... who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election.,1
November 8th.,0
[,0
Now, that is a direct threat to our democracy.,1
[,0
That's not going to even be a close election.,0
I'm not going to try to call it anything else because that's what it is.,1
All this talk about the election being rigged, trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies, that is a direct threat to our democracy.,1
And I got to tell you ... as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents, where they were exiled, where they were killed.,1
And if you don't, could be a very unhappy November 8th.,0
We're also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare ... [,0
And the numbers are horrendous.,0
I take this really seriously.,1
Your premiums are going up by 50, 60, 70 percent.,0
And for me, the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great ... something that ... something we can't lose, something we shouldn't even doubt.,1
We cannot give in to cynicism, and I don't think we are.,1
I'll tell you what's exciting to me is across this country, at the very moment Donald Trump is making this unprecedented attack on our fundamental values, our institutions, millions of people are standing up for democracy, registering, volunteering, voting early.,1
So when you get a little discouraged or you get frustrated by what you see in this campaign, think of this: we have just reached a historic milestone.,1
More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote.,1
And most exciting, that includes more than 50 million young people, the biggest number ever.,1
The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period ... very, very long.,0
It is a disaster.,0
Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and I'm proud to see Americans coming together ... Democrats, Republicans and Independents ... to reject hate and division.,1
It's a disaster, and everybody knows it.,0
And it's going to die of its own weight anyway, but we're going to get rid of it and we're going to replace it with some great, great alternatives ... much better health care at a much lower price.,0
And we're seeing that in New Hampshire, too.,1
[,0
We are more than our disagreements, we Americans.,1
Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care, which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America.,0
That's what she wants.,0
There is so much more that unites us than divides us.,1
I'm proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party.,1
But this energy we're seeing is not just because of what we're against, as important as that is, it's because what we're for.,1
It's about fighting for a future where everyone counts, where everyone has a place, and no one is left out or left behind.,1
That's what she's aiming at.,0
That's what Obama wanted.,0
Because to me, and I hope to you as well, this is about more than winning an election, it's about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids.,1
That's what this has to be about.,1
He didn't quite get there, but he got this, and you see how bad this has been.,0
One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice.,0
[,0
It's about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters.,1
Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools.,0
You know, we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence.,1
This education crisis afflicts all communities, but none more so than the African-American community ... none.,0
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50, 60, 70 years, some cases over a hundred years ... over a hundred years.,0
Their policies and their politics, and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton, have produced only poverty, joblessness, and rising crime.,0
Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq.,1
He has no plan to defeat ISIS.,1
When she was running for the Senate in New York State, she said she was going to produce jobs, jobs, jobs in Upstate New York.,0
It's a disaster.,0
And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote, 'a total disaster.',1
And that our country is, quote, 'looking so dumb.',1
Imagine, imagine, this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals.,1
She's going to produce jobs, big thing ... jobs, we're going to bring back jobs.,0
Been a catastrophe.,0
I don't think so.,1
He's basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started.,1
He's proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief.,1
It's not only wrong, it's dangerous, and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.,1
We've lost tens of thousands of jobs.,0
She never did a thing.,0
It was all talk, no action, just like what she's doing right now is all talk, no action.,0
She'll talk and talk, and nothing will happen.,0
Only bad will happen.,0
But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York.,0
But just in case you think that this is new for Donald, it shouldn't surprise you or anybody else, and I'll tell you why.,1
He has been denigrating America for decades.,1
She won because of them, and she produced absolutely nothing.,0
Jobs left.,0
It's today one of the worst, one of the most depressing places in this country.,0
It started before he campaigned against me.,1
So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs.,0
It started before President Obama took office.,1
In fact, back in 1987, he spent $100,000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan.,1
I know jobs.,0
She doesn't know jobs.,0
He said, and I quote, 'The world is laughing at America.',1
That I can tell you.,0
Does that sound familiar?,1
[,0
This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is.,1
Now that may be who Donald Trump is, but this election is about who we are.,1
And I want us ...,1
I want us to remember, America is great because America is good, right?,1
And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire, 'When they go, we go high.',1
This election poses a very clear choice on the economy.,1
When the middle class thrives, America thrives.,1
I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time ... the right to a safe community, a great education and a secure job.,0
[,0
As Elizabeth said, she is a perfect example of how that works in America.,1
So am I.,1
And I say to African-American parents, I say to Hispanic American parents ... and I say it with great respect ... our inner cities are a disaster ... crime, no jobs, education is the worst, in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad.,0
So are every one of you here.,1
That's what I want for every single person, especially young person, in America.,1
With your help, we're going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate, but send Maggie, send Carol, send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.,1
I say, with great respect, what do you have to lose?,0
It can't get any worse.,0
What does that mean?,1
That means jobs in infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our mass transit, our water systems.,1
There is a lot of great work to be done here.,1
And guess what?,1
Those are jobs that can't be exported.,1
They've got to be done, right here in New Hampshire and across America.,1
It can't get any worse.,0
You choose Donald Trump, I'm going to fix the problem.,0
You're going to have safety.,0
I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing, and there are, I know, a lot of skeptics about that.,1
They say, 'Well, we can't compete in manufacturing anymore.',1
[,0
Well, I'll tell you what.,1
I don't want us competing with low wage jobs.,1
I want us competing for the high wage jobs.,1
Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products.,1
We're going to get jobs, because we're going to bring our jobs back.,0
Mexico's taking our jobs.,0
I want to compete with Germany and countries like that, precision, machining, 3D printing.,1
I want us to invest more in technology, innovation and research and yes, in clean energy, because we're going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
So many other places, they're taking our jobs.,0
What China's doing to us is horrible.,0
I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years.,1
That's what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.,1
And I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared.,1
I want to start in the early years of life in early education, universal pre-K.,1
I want kids to be prepared to succeed.,1
We're going to have jobs.,0
Because we are in a competition, and you know what?,1
What do you have to lose?,0
I want us to step up and compete and win.,1
And I want our schools ...,1
I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code, and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire.,1
And I want to bring back technical education to high school.,1
I'm going to fix this.,0
I think we really ... we really shut the door on too many young people who could've gotten skills that would've given them the chance to get ahead.,1
I'm going to fix it.,0
And working with our community colleges, we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college.,1
[,0
And yes, we are going to make four-year college affordable.,1
Just this week, a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt, and I know Maggie has been fighting that.,1
And she's had a moratorium, and she's done what she could at the state level.,1
But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire, families in New Hampshire.,1
So after our primary was over ... and you know what, I was really proud ...,1
School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda, and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice.,0
I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
Competition ... the schools the schools will get better and better and better.,0
And it was a campaign ... it was a campaign about ideas, not insults.,1
[,0
And that's what campaigns should be about.,1
And after it was over, Bernie and I got together.,1
We put our heads together.,1
And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
And if you make more than that, it will be debt free.,1
In other words, pay what you can, but let's not have kids and families going into debt to get an education.,1
And that means a private school, a religious school, a charter school or a magnet school.,0
This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our country's future.,1
School choice also means that parents can home-school their children.,0
[,0
Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally, totally, like a puppet, by special interests.,0
And no matter where you go, to a great school like this, or anywhere else, we will help you pay down your student debt.,1
Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools, leading to higher unemployment and more poverty.,0
We will make is easier, because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income, so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford.,1
The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe, nobody will believe.,0
And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save, you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.,1
Now, I think in addition to growing the economy, we need to do a lot more on small business.,1
Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business.,1
And then we do have to make the economy fairer, and that starts with raising the national minimum wage, because if you work full time, I am talking about full time workers, you should not still be in poverty at the end.,1
My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children ... [,0
Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb.,1
[,0
This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs.,0
Right?,1
We are going to guarantee equal pay, we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare.,1
We are going to work for paid family leave.,1
[,0
Because this is the way families are today.,1
We are not living in the 1950s.,1
Families are under new stresses and strains, and I meet so many who are really just at the edge.,1
They are making all they can make.,1
One parent working full-time, two parents working full-time, sometimes part-time on top of full-time.,1
[,0
[,0
The other day, Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh.,1
There was a long line of people, big overflow, which we couldn't get into the main room where we were.,1
So, Tim was talking to the families there, and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child, a daughter, I think.,1
If we do this, that would mean $12,000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America.,0
What a difference this is going to make.,0
The money will follow the student to the public, private or religious school that is best for them and their family.,0
In so many ways, you're going to have choice. ,0
Tim was shaking hands, and the woman looked and she said, 'I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago, and the day after, I had my baby, I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy.,1
But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be.,1
My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city ... anybody ... anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program ... and there will be a lot of them ... to provide school choice to every child in that community.,0
I got fired.',1
In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 in funds available per student. ,0
And Tim came in, and he is such a wonderful man.,1
As your president, I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice you've ever seen.,0
[,0
What a fine human being.,1
And he said, 'To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election, and I just have another reason.',1
Again, the education can't get worse.,0
Commo Core ... we're going to end it.,0
He told me that story.,1
[,0
I think your president should care about that.,1
I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures.,0
The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again, and I'm going to bring back jobs, and I'm going to bring back the great education.,0
I think your president should wake up everyday thinking, 'Okay, how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives, how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you?',1
Sometimes people say, 'How are you going to get all this done?',1
I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign ... where my husband ended up, we had a balance budget and a surplus, and actually, we were on the way to paying down the national debt, but here is what happened.,1
What happened is trickle-down economics came back.,1
Don't be surprised ... remember this, November 8th ... don't be surprised, because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks, if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago.,0
You see what's going on?,0
[,0
They're starting ... people are starting to hear about this.,0
So here is what I am going to do.,1
And they're saying, wow.,0
Wow.,0
They're liking it.,0
We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share.,1
We are going to ... we are going to close the loopholes, we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer.,1
We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right.,1
And again, can't get any worse.,0
No ... no bank is too big to fail, and no one should be above the law, and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump.,1
It's going to get a lot better.,0
But only if I do it.,0
He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a 't' in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations, and everything will work out.,1
Well, it will for him.,1
They can't do it.,0
That is trickle down economics on steroids.,1
The Democrats, they have ... what they've done is incredible.,0
And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street.,1
And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same ... rigid.,0
It'll never change.,0
Remember, a hundred years, 70 years, 50 ... it's not going to change.,0
Not going to happen. ,0
He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create.,1
Now, let's talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come, the United States Supreme Court.,0
[,0
And you know that was bad enough, but then in the debates, we learned he hasn't paid any income tax for years.,1
So he hasn't paid a penny to support our military, our veterans, Pell grants for kids to get an education, health or anything else.,1
And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year.,1
Now, I've pondered this.,1
I've really pondered this.,1
He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes, but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?,1
Has anyone here been to a casino?,1
The next president will not only have to fill this seat, but as many as four others.,0
It could even be ...,0
I mean, we could end up with a total of five judges by one president.,0
He lost a billion dollars running casinos.,1
It would be record-setting.,0
Who does that?,1
Probably be three.,0
I've never heard of anybody.,1
So, we've got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families.,1
For all of his talk about putting America first, he makes his products in at least 12 other countries.,1
He stiffs small businesses, mom and pop contractors who work for him.,1
My dad was a small business owner.,1
Could be four.,0
He worked really hard.,1
Could even be five.,0
I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work, and people who do that work should be rewarded, not taken advantage of.,1
So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works, and today, today, we heard yet another story.,1
It's about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses.,1
And you pick the wrong people, you have a country that is no longer your country.,0
This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay, and they started harassing him.,1
It will be a disaster. ,0
They used anti-gay slurs to his face, they threw rocks and golf balls at him, his supervisor saw it and did nothing, and it got so bad, he wound up in the hospital.,1
Finally, he went to the police for help.,1
He couldn't go back to work because he was too scared for his safety, and then he was fired by Trump's golf club.,1
One of the most important issues, frankly ... other than maybe defense, because we're going to build up our military, it's so depleted.,0
Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels.,1
[,0
We're going to protect your Second Amendment, so many things.,0
For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day.,1
But one of the most important ... some people think it's actually the most important ... is the filling of the seats, United States Supreme Court.,0
You see what's happening right now?,0
And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors, Trump's golf club turned on the victim for coming forward.,1
If that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does that say about how he would run our country?,1
Essentially it's four and four.,0
So my friends, there are lots of reasons, so many, to take this election seriously.,1
But here's what I want you to know: of course, I want you to vote for all of us, but more than that, I want you to vote for yourselves, and for your families, and for your hope for our future together.,1
And you see what ... how bad it is.,0
We're going to pick great judges.,0
I've already put a list of 11 Federalist Society, highly recommended, got uniform great reviews on these 11 people.,0
And we are going to put truly great people.,0
Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what we're looking for, OK?,0
[,0
This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic, frankly.,0
Because if you believe women and girls should be treated with dignity and respect and women should be able to make our own health care decisions, and marriage equality should be protected, and that we have to take on the epidemic of substance abuse, disorders, and addiction.,1
That's what's going to happen.,0
I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution, to protect your religious liberty, and apply the law as written.,0
If you believe in a foreign policy where we work with our allies, not insult them, and achieve common goals towards peace and prosperity, then you have to vote.,1
[,0
All of these issues are on the ballot this November, and I believe with all of my heart, that we will after this election, get together to help heal the divides that have sprung up and are so painful among us.,1
So please register and vote on the same day.,1
We're not going to have that.,0
Go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place.,1
Come help us these last two weeks.,1
I've made public a list of judges, as I said, that will guide my selection process.,0
Go to hillaryclinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text 'JOIN,' J-O-I-N to 47246 and get everybody you know to come out and vote.,1
I think this election is going to turn on who is motivated to vote so we need each and every one of you to do everything you can to make it clear to everybody you know that our future is at stake.,1
Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list.,0
And we brought it up. ,0
Let's see a list.,0
You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well.,0
If you ought to be part of a positive, optimistic, confident, unifying future, please come out to vote on November 8th here in New Hampshire, and prove once and for all that love trumps hate. ,1
Thank you all!,1
[,0
Both Secretary Clinton and Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren were introduced by Margaret Hassan, the Governor of New Hampshire and currently running for the US Senate.,1
The most important election in our lifetimes.,1
They'd be rejected.,0
Clinton's judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care, the American economy, and Americans religious liberty ... not to mention your Second Amendment, which is on very thin ice right now, as you know, because of the fact that we're at four-and-four.,0
I'm so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schult,,1
If they even pick one judge who's wrong you can probably ... as you know it ... you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye.,0
Congressman Alcee Hastings, Congressman Ted Deutch, Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here, along with Senator Bill Nelson's wonderful wife, Grace Nelson.,1
So we are glad you are all here with me.,1
And I got to tell you, I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida, Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know, I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes.,1
And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.,1
And we don't want to see that.,0
I also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system, do you agree?,1
But it's going to take strong and committed leaders, like Patrick Murphy, who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done.,1
And -- and this is important, my friends, unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
I think Florida deserves a senator who's going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.,1
This is what is so unimaginable, of law enforcement officials to go door to door, house to house, business to business, school to school, rounding up 11 million people.,1
I think that is so wrong, and it is not going to happen in America.,1
Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security.,0
Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test ... its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.,0
It's just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state.,0
So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real, as opposed to someone who every time he's asked says, well I'm not a scientist.,1
And I always wonder, why don't you talk to a scientist?,1
[,0
Like start here at Broward College, you could talk to scientists.,1
And you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have, and this is a quote, "weakened us as a people.",1
His solution, Patrick's opponent's solution, is to privatize Medicare.,1
Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons, and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power.,0
They were dying three years ago.,0
The sanctions were choking them.,0
<i>Audience:</i> Boo!,1
<i>Clinton:</i> That is exactly the right response, but don't boo, vote, right?,1
And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Florida's schools, because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education.,1
They would have fallen.,0
But Obama didn't support people that would have taken over, and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.,0
So my friends, Patrick Murphy is a smart, tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.,1
But you look at what's happened to Iran in such a short period of time.,0
But remember the ransom payments.,0
That's what we need more of in Washington, people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you, a better life for you and your families, instead of blocking progress at every turn, listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what it's going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.,1
So please, when you get out and vote, please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate, and you will be glad you did.,1
Remember, it was $400 million two weeks ago.,0
Now, I know there's an overflow crowd outside and I'm so sorry they can't be in, but I'm told that they can hear us and maybe even see us, and I want to thank them for coming as well.,1
But then they made a mistake.,0
This is cash.,0
I got to ask you, did anybody see the last debate?,1
Well, the good news -- the good news was, it was the last debate.,1
Remember, they said they paid cash because they couldn't open a bank account.,0
There was no way of sending it into a checking account.,0
<i>Audience:</i> Happy birthday to you!,1
[,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, thank you!,1
Thank you.,1
Yeah, you know, you're right.,1
That last debate was like an early birthday present, right?,1
But here's what I wanted you to remember.,1
You can use your plan.,0
You can use your doctors ... 27 times, right?,0
Twenty-seven times.,0
I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.,1
You know, I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve.,1
You can use your doctors, use your plan; turned out to be a lie.,0
And in fact, my wonderful running mate I, Senator Tim Kaine, wrote a book, called "Stronger Together," and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what we're going to try to do if we're so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president. ,1
And I think it's important, because I want you to have confidence that we're going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth.,1
It's all a lie.,0
And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump, who doesn't really have very many plans.,1
It's all a big lie.,0
You know, I've tried to run a campaign based on issues, he's run a campaign based on insults.,1
It's a rigged system and it's a lie.,0
And so in the debate, we didn't have a lot to talk about, other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.,1
But in that last debate, he said something that I found horrifying.,1
Well, he said a lot of things, cut there's one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, has ever said this.,1
And I'll tell you what.,0
He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.,1
I'll tell you what.,0
The 400 million (dollars), for those that haven't been reading the papers over the last two days, turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash ... cash.,0
I guess we shouldn't be too surprised, this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him.,1
And I actually said ... they said, oh, that money's going to be used for terror.,0
I said, no, they don't need it for terror.,0
They've got 150 billion (dollars).,0
But this is serious.,1
You know, on January 20th, the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.,1
That's in addition to the $150 billion that we're giving back.,0
In America, we don't say we're going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election.,1
We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power.,1
I said they don't need it.,0
This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts.,0
They're not going to use it for terror.,0
That is one thing that makes American great, it makes America who we are.,1
They have plenty of money for terror.,0
And we don't impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty.,1
Think of it ... $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash ... massive, big vats of cash.,0
And we don't punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians, or threaten to restrict the First Amendment, because our democracy depends on a free press.,1
And we don't incite violence and turn people against each other.,1
We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.,1
You saw them ... cartons.,0
I never saw anything like it.,0
You know, I've got to say, I bet some of you or maybe your parents, or your grandpar-ents, came from places where none of that was true, right?,1
There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known, because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love, you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.,1
I've seen a lot of cash.,0
[,0
And Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years.,1
Now, after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, women, POWs, Muslims, people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself.,1
So here's what I want you to know, in the four years, we are going to change some things in America, right?,1
I do want to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
Can you imagine these guys?,0
Planes get ... they stop.,0
Remember, they wouldn't give back the hostages.,0
They waited there for hours and hours.,0
And we're going to do that, along with other positive changes, but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.,1
You know, I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king.,1
Right?,1
And Obama kept saying, no, no, this has nothing to do ... even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in, not to take them back, because they were waiting for something.,0
It was this ... just another lie.,0
Now, Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.,1
Instead, that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made.,1
Eight years, it's time to move on.,1
We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king.,1
We would not be subjects, we would be independent citizens.,1
But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash?,0
Ai, yai, yai.,0
They think we're stupid.,0
I cherish that idea.,1
So here's the good news.,1
[,0
They won't be thinking it for long.,0
Americans are coming together.,1
At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy, millions of people are registering, voting early and volunteering in this campaign.,1
And here's something very exciting.,1
We have reached a milestone.,1
[,0
[,0
At the same time, ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross.,0
More than 200 million Americans are now registered, and that includes 15 million young people, the most ever in history.,1
And you know what?,1
ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East.,0
More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida. ,1
We cannot let this evil continue ... can 't let it.,0
So I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in, and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division, and I am so excited about what that means.,1
[,0
To defeat ISIS, we must use military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare and ideological warfare.,0
It's a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago ... different world.,0
But the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against, it's about what we're for.,1
We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism ... [,0
Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy, so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.,0
It really is.,1
It's about fighting for that future where everyone counts, everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind.,1
But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do.,1
I feel good, but boy, I am not taking anything for granted.,1
By the way, President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates.,0
I'm going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election that's two weeks from today.,1
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more.,0
But it's almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria.,0
They take others, but they don't take Christians ... very, very, very rare.,0
And you know, it's so important for Florida.,1
There are so many issues that we need to remind people about.,1
Last time I was here, I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis.,1
And you know why?,1
So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region.,0
Because we're seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida.,1
We want to take care of people.,0
But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue, and we have to stop this.,0
This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country.,0
We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding.,1
And the ocean is rising.,1
And what we've got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change, creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities, and that's why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.,1
It's from within.,0
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse.,0
This could be it.,0
I have to say, nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done.,1
I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us, where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.,1
I got to tell you, I believe America is great because America is good.,1
And I want to tell you one other thing.,1
I want to say one other thing that's really very important to me.,1
We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.,1
That's why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already, and I quote him, "a total disaster" and that our country is, again a quote, "looking dumb.",1
You ever notice on the ... you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones.,0
Cellphones.,0
Really?,1
And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them.,0
He's declaring defeat before the battle has even started.,1
He's proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.,1
And some of them have things far worse than that ... scenes far worse than that.,0
So it was the failed policies, you have to remember, of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place.,0
Here's another example.,1
He was asked if he would defend our allies.,1
He said well, first he'd want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them.,1
And when asked specifically about Israel, he said, and I quote again, he would "love to be neutral.",1
Now, we can't have a president who says he's neutral on Monday, pro-Israel on Tuesday, and who knows what on Wednesday, because in his mind, everything is negotiable.,1
If they did the right thing, you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now.,0
[,0
You know, she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground.,0
Now, even if you don't want boots on the ground, you don't want to say it.,0
Don't say it!,0
Now they're saying, oh, I hope she wins.,0
Oh, boy, would they dream of having her as president.,0
Can you ... [,0
But even if you believe ... and I can understand that.,0
I have a different view.,1
We stand with our allies.,1
No boots on the ground, I can understand.,0
We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.,1
So I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together.,1
And with your help, we're going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing, and clean renewable energy, and small busi-nesses.,1
You don't say it!,0
Let them think they're going to go through hell.,0
Don't say it!,0
[,0
Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur, can you imagine the great General George Patton, or one of our great generals that we have today ... General Flynn, who's here someplace ... [,0
I love General Flynn ... but can you imagine these people saying ...,0
I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.,1
I mean, they're basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground.,0
We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time.,1
If you don't want that, I fully understand.,0
And I've got to say no state, no state should care more about this issue than Florida.,1
Right?,1
And you know, I'll tell you something that it's kind of sad, to be honest with you.,1
Don't say it!,0
I've traveled all over the country.,1
And in New Jersey and Massachusetts, they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.,1
Don't say it!,0
Why?,1
Could you imagine MacArthur saying we're going to fight the enemy, and we're going to move our troops in in about a month, we're going to hit from behind?,0
Well, because you have a governor and a legislature who, like your current senator, doesn't want to believe the science of climate change; doesn't see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.,1
And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term, and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.,1
And we're also going to strengthen education at every level, starting with universal pre-K, and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code.,1
[,0
You know, I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room, but maybe we shouldn't be so honest when it comes to military strategy.,0
Does that make sense?,0
[,0
And here's what I want all the students to hear, we're going to make college more affordable for everyone.,1
[,0
Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq, Syria and Libya.,0
The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy.,0
You know, after our primary, which was hard-fought, and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues.,1
She really is.,0
Senator Sanders and I got together, came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125,000 a year.,1
That's the vast majority of families.,1
And if you're over that, we're going to make it debt-free.,1
So pay what you can afford.,1
But I don't want to see young people and their families going into debt.,1
She's trigger-happy, and yet she says no boots, which is sort of ... probably will be boots, you know.,0
Probably will turn out to be another disaster.,0
He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death.,0
She's just too quick to intervene, invade, or to push for regime change with people we don't even know who they are.,0
I view this as an investment.,1
And that's why we're going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.,1
And I also want more pathways to good jobs that don't require a four-year college de-gree.,1
And they take over, and they're far worse.,0
This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.,0
My administration, on the other hand, will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism.,0
Let's return technical education to high schools.,1
And by the way, that includes Russia.,0
Let's do more with our community colleges.,1
Let's have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.,1
If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS, that is just fine as far as I'm concerned.,0
And you know, in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs, I want to make it fairer.,1
That's why I want to raise the national minimum wage.,1
[,0
That's life.,0
But you can never fail to recognize your enemies.,0
We have some real enemies.,0
Unfortunately for our country, our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails.,0
If you work full-time, you shouldn't still be in poverty.,1
These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena.,0
And don't you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
What's that?,0
Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never, ever see them.,0
And, you know, I always tell crowds, this is not a women's issue.,1
It's a family issue.,1
She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them, and many were destroyed with a hammer.,0
[,0
[,0
If you have a wife, a mother, a sister or a daughter working, it's your issue.,1
And that's why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.,1
And let's make childcare affordable.,1
Destroyed them with a hammer ... the old-fashioned way, I guess.,0
And let's have more profit sharing.,1
[,0
And let's do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up.,1
The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum ... did anybody see that?,0
Now, you know, when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues, you know, Donald Trump or somebody always says, well, there she goes playing the woman card.,1
And I've got to tell you, I don't believe that's what it is.,1
[,0
[,0
Well, we have a big debate coming up.,0
I think we're paying -- playing the smart card.,1
Who knows what's going to happen there?,0
But I will say, every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief.,0
Because we want everybody's incomes to go up.,1
[,0
Now we have a debate coming up.,0
That's how we're going to get this economy really moving forward, creating new jobs.,1
And so if that's playing the woman card, you know what we say, deal me in.,1
I've also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, because we don't need to do that.,1
I don't imagine any of you going to be watching the debate, right?,0
[,0
We can go where the money is, the millionaires and the billionaires, the corporations, to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.,1
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Don't take her bait.,0
We're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.,1
Don't take her bait.,0
MR. TRUMP: I won't; I promise.,0
Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly.,0
That's why she lost.,0
Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadn't paid any federal taxes?,1
That's why she did so poorly.,0
For about 20 years is the best guess we've got, and his excuse, I love his excuse, his excuse was well, he lost $1 billion in a year.,1
She was terrible.,0
I've been really pondering this.,1
How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year, especially when you're running casinos?,1
Think about it.,1
She was ... honestly, I shouldn't be saying this ... she was terrible.,0
[,0
Has anybody here ever been to a casino?,1
<i>Audience:</i> Yes!,1
Every time she talks about them, she talks about them differently.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, you know, usually they say the house wins, so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes.,1
Well, if losing $1 billion is smart, I think that's kind of upside down and backwards.,1
[,0
I think people should be working hard to make their incomes, to support their families, and that's what we're going to do because we don't want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.,1
He stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses.,1
But there can be no answer when she deletes 33,000 emails, bleaches them so they can never be recovered ... an unheard-of practice ... hammers them into total silence.,0
My dad was a small business owner.,1
Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks, workers, small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass, or where he bought pianos, he didn't pay them.,1
He just doesn't pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well, go ahead and sue me.,1
You know what happening.,0
You know what's happening.,0
I always say, getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career.,0
[,0
Well, my dad, because he was a small business man, I know he could never have afforded that, so I'm just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump, because our family would have been hurt by that.,1
It's true.,0
[,0
They were bad.,0
So here's the bottom line and here's what I need you to do.,1
And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest.,0
And you know, she was blaming Matt Lauer.,0
We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote, and you have early voting now and it's going to be much easier for some of you to vote early.,1
I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job.,0
And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign, if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect, if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.,1
If you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action, if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax, then I hope you will come out and vote because it's going to be a close election.,1
I mean, his questions to me were very tough.,0
Pay no attention to the polls.,1
[jeers</i>] ... to me, that was the tough one.,0
Don't get -- don't get complacent, because we've got to turn people out.,1
[,0
[,0
So I'm asking you to vote for me, I'm asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, I'm asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves, because really, that's what is at stake.,1
So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday.,1
[,0
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president, for many reasons.,0
It goes through Sunday, November 6th.,1
You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM.,1
[,0
In fact, you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.,1
True.,0
And we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you, so hey, go ahead and vote now.,1
[,0
And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote.,1
It's just so bad.,0
[,0
But don't stop there.,1
If you will join us in these next two weeks, every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference.,1
So please, go to HillaryClinton.com, sign up to volunteer, take out your phone, text JOIN to 47246, and get involved, because the bigger the turnout, the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.,1
Now, let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time, you know, what moti-vates you, how do you do this day after day?,1
And you know, look, I love this country, and I feel blessed.,1
I feel blessed, and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream, and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.,1
[,0
And one more issue, finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy, and helping those in need.,0
I think a lot about my two grandchildren, because obviously, I would do anything to help them, but it's not just them.,1
I want to help everybody's children and grandchildren, because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education, on healthcare, on ending the epidemic of gun violence, on getting the cost of prescription drugs down, on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare, doing what we must to make sure we're passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.,1
So please join me.,1
There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians.,0
This is bigger than me, it's bigger than any of us.,1
It's even bigger than Donald Trump, if you can believe it.,1
This is a crossroads election that's going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead.,1
[,0
Going to do it, with a lot of other people going to help.,0
I want to wake up in the White House with your help, making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person, and particularly every child, the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.,1
If you will stand with me, if you will work with me over the next two weeks, let's go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves, for our kids, and let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.,1
Thank you all very much.,1
As you president, I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country ... millions of new jobs.,0
[,0
They've gone to other countries.,0
They've gone to Mexico.,0
It is great to be back in western Michigan.,1
Thank you.,1
They've gone to many other countries.,0
China's taking massive advantage of us.,0
Are there any Lakers here?,1
Oh, my gosh.,1
It's all so easy, believe me.,0
It's all so easy.,0
I am so thrilled to be here.,1
That includes, we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses.,0
[,0
I want to thank the president of this great university, Tom Haas, the faculty, the staff, the students.,1
[,0
I want to thank Brandon Dillon, the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.,1
And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.,1
[,0
And if they don't want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway, not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs, we will terminate NAFTA, believe me.,0
I have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie, gotten to know her, become a friend of hers, and I am so excited at the possibility that I'll be able to work with her again.,1
But I want you to know this - and I really, really hope you'll tell folks, because there is no more dedicated, effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.,1
[,0
She fights for all of you every day, but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face.,1
And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking.,1
And don't we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other.,1
It's going to be America first, and it's going to be the American worker first.,0
So it's wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.,1
Are you ready to vote tomorrow, Michigan?,1
[,0
Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow?,1
Crucially, I will also fight for the American family and American family values.,0
The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda.,0
That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.,1
Has to be.,0
The choice in this election could not be clearer.,1
[,0
Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family, Phyllis Schlafly.,0
And I know that for many people, you've gone back and forth, you've thought about what to do, and I really respect that.,1
Great woman, really great woman.,0
[,0
But let me say this.,1
I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St. Louis.,0
Let me say this.,1
This election is basically between division and unity in our country.,1
[,0
It's between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk.,1
It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top.,1
Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America.,0
And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about.,1
She understood that, to be truly united as a country, we can't simply turn to government or to politicians.,0
The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God.,0
Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot, those issues, and those values, are on the ballot as well.,1
Phyllis understood that.,0
[,0
And by the way, Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago, when it wasn't necessarily ... [,0
And she was incredible.,0
And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election.,1
I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades, and people who ran for president.,1
She was so brave.,0
She endorsed me, and that was not the thing to do at the time.,0
I was privileged to know as a college student, Gerald Ford.,1
People said, Trump?,0
She said, he's going to win, you don't understand.,0
He knows how to win.,0
He's going to win.,0
In fact, I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee, which he headed, after my junior year in college.,1
So when I say I've gotten to know a lot of our presidents, and people who've run for president, it goes back a ways.,1
And here's what I want you to understand.,1
I didn't agree with everything they did or said.,1
[,0
And we went boom, boom, boom.,0
Even the Democrats.,1
We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle, but I never doubted, I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.,1
But I will tell you, Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasn't necessarily the thing to do, even the popular thing to do, and I will never forget that.,0
That's why this election is so different.,1
That had a huge impact.,0
And it's why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me, and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party.,1
She was a great, great, powerful woman with a tremendous heart.,0
And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow, because you really ... that's a celebration.,0
She was 92 years old.,0
Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.,1
[,0
We are all equal, and we all come from the same Creator.,0
If we remember that simple fact, then our future is truly limitless.,0
There is nothing we as Americans can't do.,0
There's a biblical verse that I have often read, and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what we're trying to achieve right now for our country.,0
I was at Kent State, in Ohio, last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair.,1
It's from 1 John, Chapter 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.",0
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen.,0
MR. TRUMP: So true.,0
[,0
[,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God, saluting one flag.,0
And Mr. Blair had served in the Air Force, he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer.,1
[,0
This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017, we will be one American nation.,0
That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed.,1
It's time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future.,0
Have to do it.,0
Together, we will make America believe again, we will make America united again, and we will make America great again.,0
And his job - imagine the responsibility.,1
A young Air Force officer in his twenties, waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.,1
Thank you very much, and God bless you.,0
Thank you.,0
And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a president's order to do that.,1
[,0
Thank you very much.,0
The joint chiefs of our military forces can't say, "No, don't do it.",1
[,0
There's no veto from Congress or anyone else.,1
And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.,1
So after watching this election Mr. Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing.,1
In particular, I want to thank Mr. Ron Packard and Ms. Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school.,0
Today, we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice.,0
But before we do, I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clinton's emails.,0
And several dozen of them - I'd never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.,1
According to the FBI report: "The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact, and, in doing so, obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account.",0
The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote.,1
Remember, Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program ... among many other extremely sensitive matters.,0
This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief.,0
By the way, the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night, where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees, unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism, and made us less safe than ever before.,0
Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.,1
Throughout it all, she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.,0
These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia, doing favors for UBS bank, and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti.,0
I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions.,1
It's all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation.,0
As part of her criminal cover-up, Hillary Clinton's staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena.,0
Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer.,0
Then, when she was interviewed by the FBI, she claimed she couldn't remember important events 39 times.,0
She couldn't even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information.,0
She even said she didn't know that the letter "C" stood for confidential classified information.,0
All the while, as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests, the world fell apart.,0
Hillary Clintons' policies produced ruin in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.,0
She failed in Russia, in China, in North Korea.,0
Her policies unleashed ISIS, spread terrorism, and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons ... not to mention the ransom payments.,0
Did any of you see the debates?,1
First of all, I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.,1
On top of it all, Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy.,0
She's raced to invade, intervene, and topple regimes.,0
She believes in globalism, not Americanism.,0
Last night, she even falsely said no American died in Libya.,0
Then she also falsely said there's no ground troops in Iraq, even though we have 5,000 military personnel there right now.,0
But I have to say, in addition to that, there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by.,1
But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America.,1
Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race.,0
I opposed going in, and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out ... letting ISIS fill the void.,0
But I was opposed to the war from the beginning.,0
Long after Howard Stern, but three months before the Iraq war started, I said, in an interview with Neil Cavuto, that "perhaps [we] shouldn't be doing it yet," and that "the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned.",0
Then, On March 25th of 2003, just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is "a mess," yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.,0
Now I have to tell you, I know we've got problems.,1
In July of 2003, I said that "I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places, because you know, they really need and it they need it badly.",0
I've spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people, hearing what's on people's minds.,1
We've got challenges but America's always had challenges.,1
And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?,1
I had a number of quotes to this effect.,0
I often didn't recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing.,1
Because from my perspective, looking back at our history, we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us.,1
And you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.,1
And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that America's best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.,1
Then, in August of 2004, very early in the conflict, I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine.,0
Make no mistake.,1
Our core values are being tested in this election.,1
But my faith in our future has never been stronger.,1
"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in.,0
Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was introduced by Mr. Khizr Khan.,1
I would never have handled it that way.,0
Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country?,0
C'mon.,0
Some of you know or remember that his son, Captain Khan, serving in the United States Army, was killed serving in Iraq.,1
Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.,0
And like at the Democratic Convention this summer, he spoke powerfully about what America means to him.,1
What was the purpose of the whole thing?,0
And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world.,1
Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed.,0
People look at us with yearning.,1
And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs?,0
They see that we are a beacon of freedom, hope and opportunity for people, right here, at home.,1
Not to mention the other side.,0
When I heard Mr. Khan speak at the convention, and I heard him again last night, I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country.,1
He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak, and all of the things he said about so many people, not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldn't help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his son's medals - he got the Bronze Star, he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in.,1
All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces.,0
And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong.,0
And he thought to himself, "Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trump's America?",1
All this for nothing!,0
Think about that for a minute.,1
Because every single one of us has something to contribute.,1
To this great country.,1
We are already great but we can be greater.,1
I would have been tougher on terrorism.,0
And we will be greater.,1
Bin Laden would have been caught long ago.",0
Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion, I would have cast a vote in opposition.,0
For years, I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clinton's failed career.,0
Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen.,0
I love our country and I believe in the American people, and I know there is nothing we can't do when we make up our minds.,1
I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had.,0
Throughout our history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time.,1
They defended democracy.,1
But in Iraq, my judgement was right and hers was wrong.,0
They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known.,1
They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights and union rights, for LGBT rights, rights for people with disabilities.,1
And now, now we've got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time.,1
Hillary Clinton is always complaining about what's wrong, but she's been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it ... all you have to do is look at New York State, when she was a Senator.,0
We've got to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top.,1
All talk, but nothing happened.,0
If you believe, as I do, that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow. ,1
We are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II.,1
Jobs in infrastructure.,1
We're on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.,0
Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.,1
These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported.,1
Meanwhile, massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair.,0
They've got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.,1
And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing.,1
It's time to rebuild America.,0
I am not one of these folks who think, "We just can't make it in America anymore.",1
Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream.,0
And I'll tell you why.,1
Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan, we can lead the world in precision machining, in 3-D printing.,1
We're not competing for low-wage jobs, we're competing with Germany for high manufacturing, high- skilled jobs.,1
We are one nation, and when any part of our country hurts ... our whole country hurts.,0
And we are going to have clean, renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change.,1
My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation ... African-American, Hispanic-American, all Americans ... will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education, and a great job.,0
That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety.,0
In order to help our children succeed, our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community.,0
As you heard, my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas.,1
You can't have prosperity without security.,0
And as I pointed out in the last debate, he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel, made by American steel workers.,1
This is the new civil rights agenda of our time.,0
He's gone all over this country, and he's gone all over Michigan, talking about how he's gonna really get more jobs and he's going to bring back what used to be there.,1
The right to a safe community, a quality education, and a secure job.,0
Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.,0
Well I'll tell you what.,1
Look at his record, don't just listen to his rhetoric.,1
Because I have a different idea.,1
There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly.,0
We're going to invest in America again.,1
And for every-body who is frustrated, and anxious, and maybe even angry because they feel left out, left behind, that America's not working the way it should - I understand that.,1
I under-stand that.,1
I represented upstate New York for eight years, and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories, picking up and moving out.,1
The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success.,0
It is time to break-up that monopoly.,0
But I also realized that anger is not a plan.,1
I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom ... the civil right ... to attend the school of their choice.,0
This includes private schools, traditional public schools, magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice.,0
Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative ... with billions left over.,0
It's simply a matter of putting students first, not the education bureaucracy.,0
You've got to come together and figure out what is it we're gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.,1
And I'll just tell you that I believe that we've got to defend the American worker's right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.,1
Let's run through the numbers.,0
At the state and federal level, the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year.,0
That's an average of about $12,296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools.,0
We're gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state.,1
The federal government pays for about 10 percent...$64 billion, to be precise...of the K-12 costs.,0
That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S. Department of Education.,0
And we're also gonna do more to help small business.,1
My dad was a small businessman.,1
He worked really hard.,1
He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies, and I would from time to time help him out.,1
You take a silkscreen, you put it down on the long table, you pour the paint in, you do the squeegee, you pick it up - it wasn't automated, we were the automaters - and you'd go all the way down to one table, you'd go to the other table.,1
The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states.,0
So I know how hard people in small business work.,1
And I also know something else.,1
Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills.,1
And I have said, "I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump, because we could not have afforded that.",1
But it's not just enough to grow the economy.,1
We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world.,0
Yet, our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries.,0
We have to make it fairer.,1
Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools.,0
New York City spends $20,226 dollars per pupil.,0
Baltimore spends $15,287 dollars per student.,0
Chicago spends $11,976 dollars per student, and in Los Angeles it is $10,602.,0
Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money ... allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice.,0
And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote.,1
Not only would this empower families, but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes.,0
These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family ... not the needs of the Teachers' Union.,0
There is no more important job than a teacher, and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms.,0
The current government monopoly, while great for the bureaucrats, has utterly failed too many students.,0
According to the National Assessment of Education Progress, only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading.,0
I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job.,1
I believe in hard work.,1
That's how I was raised.,1
But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldn't still be in poverty at the end of the year.,1
And I'm gonna raise the national minimum wage.,1
Failing schools then contribute to failing economies.,0
And one of the things I've heard all over America, especially from young families, really from all families but particularly young families, is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare?,1
In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent.,0
In Baltimore, it is 16.2 percent, 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City.,0
In Los Angeles, 26 percent of African American women live in poverty.,0
In Baltimore, the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent.,0
In New York, over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty.,0
Nationwide, nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty ... including 45% of children under the age of six.,0
In lots of states, it's more expensive than college tuition.,1
We're gonna get the cost of childcare down.,1
We're going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or you're sick you won't lose your job.,1
I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that.,1
Thank you.,1
Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success.,0
Meanwhile, we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities ... which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for America's children.,0
Thank you.,1
Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015.,0
Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%.,0
I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month, with a big crowd, and we couldn't get everybody in, like today, so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby, probably about three years old.,1
And he stopped to talk to her and she said, "I came here because I wanted to tell you, and to tell Hillary Clinton, what happened to me.",1
She said that, "I had my baby, it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off.,1
And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I won't be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said, "OK. You're fired.",1
That is legal in America, still.,1
And what that does is to say that - wait a minute, do we really value children?,1
Do we really value families?,1
There have been nearly 3,000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year.,0
And we've got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in today's America.,1
Government is failing our citizens at every level.,0
And then finally, I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for women's work.,1
That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America.,0
And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause, as you can tell - but this is not just a woman's issue.,1
It's a family issue.,1
If you have a wife, a mother, a sister, a daughter, who's in the work force, you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.,1
Just about everything I've said so far my opponent disagrees with.,1
That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public, private or religious school of their choice.,0
And whenever I talk about affordable childcare, and paid family leave, and equal pay - he says I'm playing the woman's card and you know what I say, if that's the case?,1
Then deal me in.,1
And here's what else I want you to know.,1
It's fair to ask, "How are you going to pay for that?",1
That's not only fair, that's necessary to ask.,1
Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect you're a good steward of your family budget.,1
I have proposed a very simple formula.,1
Here is how it will work.,0
I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.,1
And for small businesses, we're gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief.,1
So instead, we're going where the money is, to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.,1
Right now, about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide.,0
These are opportunity scholarships, tax credits, and education savings accounts.,0
This covers about 400,000 students in our country.,0
And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed.,1
His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations.,1
That is trickle-down economics on steroids.,1
Altogether, school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide.,0
I profoundly disagree.,1
Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration.,0
I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, not from the top down.,1
They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone.,0
My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice.,0
When you think about it, Donald hasn't paid anything for 20 years.,1
He's paid zero to support our military, our vets, Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley, our high-ways - and I am still pondering, I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.,1
This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars.,0
Specifically, my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty.,0
Especially when you're running casinos.,1
I do not understand that.,1
But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because he's not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting.,1
We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend.,0
Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws, encouraging them to participate.,0
And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.,1
This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students.,0
So, we'll still wonder.,1
A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds.,0
But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs, not create jobs.,1
Ohio is a leader in school choice.,0
And we can't afford that.,1
Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30,000 students, and 384 charter schools serving 123,844 students.,0
We need to keep building.,1
We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but we're not where we need to be yet.,1
The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down.,1
But the $20 billion is only the beginning.,0
And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.,1
As President, I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty.,0
And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.,1
And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote.,1
I've got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public, private, charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family.,0
Each state will develop its own formula, but we want the dollars to follow the student.,0
9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level.,0
To achieve this long-term goal, we will have to make this a shared national mission ... to bring hope to every child in every city in this land.,0
It was a campaign about ideas and issues, not insults.,1
I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states, and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city, state and federal level who support school choice.,0
And when it was over, we actually got together.,1
My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America ... Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit ... that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community.,0
In Baltimore, for instance, that would mean more than $15,000 funds available per student.,0
What a novel idea.,1
We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared.,1
I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore.,0
If we can put a man on the moon, dig out the Panama Canal, and win two World Wars, then I have no doubt that we, as a nation, can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America.,0
If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice, on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars, that could provide $12,000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty.,0
The money will follow the student.,0
So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.,1
Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125,000 a year.,1
And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt.,1
That means the student will be able to attend the public, private, charter or magnet school of their choice ... and each state will develop its own system that works best for them.,0
As your President, I will be the nation's biggest cheerleader for school choice.,0
I understand many stale old politicians will resist.,0
But it's time for our country to start thinking big once again.,0
We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words, when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.,0
And if you have gone into debt, if you're among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt, we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.,1
I will also support merit-pay for teachers, so that we reward great teachers ... instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones.,0
It makes no sense at all.,1
We have interest rates that are really low right now.,1
Buy a car for what, 1 or 2 percent.,1
At the same time, we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college.,0
My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country, especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities.,0
You can buy a house for 3,4 percent.,1
My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper, but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year.,0
By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation, we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities.,0
There are so many people who are paying 8, 10, 12, higher - 8, 10, 12 percent interest - how much?,1
Twelve point seven.,1
Fourteen point one.,1
Crucially, my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America.,0
I got to tell you friends.,1
That is outrageous.,1
We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world ... that's money coming straight out of states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, and so many others.,0
The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.,1
I can't wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and we're gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.,1
Look.,1
By ending foreign currency manipulation, product dumping, and other predatory trading practices, we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America.,0
The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation, and exciting opportunities for our children.,0
Working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now.,1
All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past.,0
And that has to be our mission together.,1
Doing all we can to help every American, and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential.,1
I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.,1
So after tomorrow the work will begin, and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together.,1
A lot of people say we've got to heal our country, or as the Bible says repair the breach.,1
Because we have so much divisiveness right now.,1
We've had a failed foreign policy.,0
A failed education policy.,0
A failed economic policy.,0
We've got to start listening to each other.,1
Respecting each other.,1
And, underneath it all, a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have ... or how many journalists they know ... not how many Americans they help to live better lives.,0
But the failures of the past are about to end.,0
Those failures end beginning on November 8th.,0
I know it is unusual, I admit, for somebody running for president, especially the day before an election, but I've been saying this for months.,1
We will have One American Nation.,0
We will be One American People.,0
To say that we need more of two things right now.,1
We need more love and kindness in America.,1
We are fighting to give every child, in every forgotten stretch of this country, the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace.,0
I don't know about you, I don't know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe, I hope, we've all extended one.,1
I am standing here today because my mother, who was abandoned by her parents, rejected by her grandparents, went to work at the age of 14 as a maid, and a babysitter, was extended kindness.,1
Not by those who should have loved her, but by others.,1
The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, who began bringing extra food.,1
The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school.,1
She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents' home and she got this job.,1
And that woman said, "I know you want to go to high school.,1
That means a safe neighborhood, a quality education, and a secure high-paying job.,0
This is how we will rebuild our future.,0
This is how We Will Make America Great Again ... For Everyone.,0
If you get up early and you get your chores done, you can go to high school, but you'll have to come back because we'll need you in the late afternoon.",1
Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift.,1
I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others.,1
And ...,1
Thank you.,0
There's a version of the golden rule in every major religion.,1
I thank Commander Dale Barnett, your vice commanders, and your constitutional officers.,0
You have all done such an incredible job.,0
And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down.,1
The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up?,1
The men and women of the American Legion represent the best of America.,0
And for people in our country who feel like they've been knocked down and nobody cares, nobody's paying attention, here's what I want you to know.,1
Strength, courage, selfless devotion.,0
Your organization, and its members, have done so much to defend our country, our flag, and to advance the cause of Americanism ... not Globalism.,0
We are in your debt.,0
If you give me the honor of being your president I'm gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.,1
Because I want to be a president for all Americans.,1
Democrats, Republicans, Independents.,1
I will never let you down.,0
Not just the people who support me, everybody in this country.,1
Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future.,1
So let's take that first step tomorrow.,1
If you don't know where you're supposed to vote go to iwillvote.com - you can get all the information you need.,1
Together, we are going to work on so many shared goals.,0
But I want to begin by discussing one goal that I know is so important to all of you: promoting American pride and patriotism in America's schools.,0
If you want to help us bringing out the vote here in western Michigan in the last 24, 36 hours, you can still sign up to volunteer.,1
In A Trump Administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America's children.,0
We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America's history, its institutions, and its heroes.,0
We will stop apologizing for America, and we will start celebrating America.,0
Go to hillaryclinton.com.,1
Or you can text join247246 or stop by one of our offices.,1
We would be really excited to see you, because when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you'll be able to say that you voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.,1
We will be united by our common culture, values and principles ... becoming One American Nation.,0
One country, under one constitution, saluting one American Flag.,0
An America where we build bridges, not walls.And an America where we prove that yes, love trumps hate. ,1
Thank you all so much.,1
The flag all of you helped to protect and preserve.,0
That flag deserves respect, and I will work with American Legion to help to strengthen respect for our flag ... and, by the way, we want young Americans to recite the Pledge of Allegiance.,0
I want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children.,1
I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us.,1
In addition to teaching respect for the flag, we also have to make sure we give our military the tools they need to defend that flag and to deter violence and aggression from our foreign adversaries.,0
We will rebuild our depleted military, and pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.,0
We will do it based on those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.,0
And to all of the elected officials, all of the organizers and the volunteers, I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about what's at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.,1
We will make sure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have the best equipment, training and tools in the world ... and we will ensure that they have the best medical care in the world, both in service, and when they return home as civilians.,0
That will require a total reform of the Veterans Administration.,0
And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.,1
I've laid out a ten-step VA reform plan you can review on my website.,0
I was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration.,1
And a lot of people told me they had already voted, but I said, 'Get your friends.,1
Here are the basics:,0
Get your family.,1
I will appoint a Secretary of Veterans Affairs whose personal mission will be to clean up the VA.,0
The Secretary's sole mandate will be to serve our veterans ... not bureaucrats, not politicians, but veterans.,0
Get everybody you know to vote' because you've got early voting here in this county, in Volusia County, until November 5th.,1
I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline anyone who fails our veterans or breaches the public trust.,0
No excuses.,1
I will appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA, and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for reforming the entire system.,0
Everybody's got to get out and vote.,1
And that's what this canvass is meant to make sure we do.,1
Right?,1
We are going to ensure every veteran in America gets timely access to top-quality care, including the best care in the world for our female veterans.,0
The Veterans health system will remain a public system, because it is a public trust.,0
But never again will we allow any veteran to suffer or die waiting for care.,0
Now, I'm sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday.,1
Well, if you're like me, you probably have a few questions about it.,1
That means Veterans will have the right to go to a VA facility, or the right to see a private doctor or clinic of their choice ... whatever is fastest and best for the veteran.,0
The Veteran will be in control.,0
Should I have the honor of serving as president, we are also going to start facing the world with confidence again.,0
We are going to uphold the laws of the nation and defend our sovereignty and security ... and our border.,0
It is pretty strange.,1
It's pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election.,1
In fact, in fact, it's not just strange.,1
I just came back from a great meeting with the President of Mexico, where I expressed my deep respect for the people of his country, and for the tremendous contributions of Mexican-Americans in our country ... including to our Armed Services.,0
I want to again thank him for his gracious hospitality, and express my belief that we can work together to accomplish great things for both of our countries.,0
It's unprecedented.,1
We agreed in the meeting on the need to stop the illegal flow of guns, drugs, cash and people across the border and to take out the cartels.,0
We also talked about the importance of working to keep jobs and wealth in our hemisphere.,0
And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts.,1
And so we've called on Director Comey to explain everything right away, put it all out on the table.,1
A more prosperous Mexico means fewer illegal border crossings, and a better market for products made in the United States.,0
Right?,1
When I am President, I am going to look at every trade deal we have across the world and see what steps must be taken to protect American jobs and create new opportunities for American workers.,0
We will fight for every last American job.,0
We're going to show ourselves and the world again what a strong and growing American economy looks like.,0
Now, of course, Donald Trump is already making up lies about this.,1
He is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people.,1
I think it's time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering, to stop disgracing himself, to stop attacking our democracy.,1
We can't let him get away with this, can we?,1
We are going to give major tax relief to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs back to our shores ... and unleash an American Energy Revolution.,0
Now, like any campaign, there have been ups and downs and ups and downs, but I've got to tell you I feel so motivated, so excited, so ready because I've always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families.,1
We will also be appointing justices who will defend our Constitution.,0
I will nominate men and women to the court who meet the high standard of Antonin Scalia, judges who have the wisdom and integrity to follow the law and not just make it up.,0
What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night, and I'm going to stay focused on that, because you know on November 9th that's what's going to matter.,1
Above all, these next four years, I will be uncompromising in the defense of the United States and our friends and allies.,0
We can't let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions.,1
It's got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren ... and who can help take us there as your president. ,1
[<i>Chants of "Hillary!,1
We are going to end the era of nation-building, and create a new foreign policy ... joined by our partners in the Middle East ... that is focused on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
"</i>] ,1
Now, I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president who's ready to bring us together, keep us safe, and make the economy work for everyone, not just those at the top, and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.,1
We will extend the hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.,0
At the same time, we will change our immigration screening procedures to help keep terrorists and extremists out of our country.,0
Now, I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president.,1
That includes stopping the influx of Syrian refugees.,0
That's how I was raised.,1
When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church, and I felt right at home.,1
And my mother ... my mother taught me to never, ever quit.,1
Now what does that mean?,1
My opponent wants a 550% increase.,0
Well, that means everybody gets knocked down.,1
I, on the other hand, want to build a safe zone overseas ... and use the money saved to invest in America.,0
It is time to create a New American Future ... for you, your children, and all American children yet to come.,0
What matters is whether you get back up.,1
And I've been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, and I'm not stopping now.,1
We're just getting started.,1
And let's always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: 'When they go low, we go high.',1
So no matter what they throw at us in these last days, we're not going to back down.,1
In this future, we will have an honest government ... and that includes an honest State Department, not Pay-For-Play.,0
We're not going to get distracted.,1
Government access and favors will no longer be for sale, and important email records will no longer be deleted and digitally bleached.,0
We're not going to get knocked off course.,1
We will also have an efficient and responsible federal budget ... no more waste, no more throwing away taxpayer dollars.,0
Because we know how much the election matters.,1
We know how many people are counting on us.,1
And that's why we're going to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision about America.,1
We are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th.,1
Right?,1
Because Donald Trump's strategy is pretty simple.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
It will be an inclusive society, one that offers hope and opportunity to every part of this country ... including our inner cities.,0
We will ensure that every child in this land, including African-American and Hispanic child, is put on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a great job.,0
They've even said it in his campaign.,1
We will follow the noble example of our military men and women, working selflessly across all difference races and incomes and backgrounds, to achieve unity and accomplish amazing things.,0
Ladies and gentlemen of the American Legion, I ask today for the honor of your vote.,0
Working in unison, we can deliver the real American change our country so desperately needs.,0
We will make America Strong Again.,0
It's to get women to stay home, get young people to stay home, get people of color to stay home, and get a lot ... get a lot of smart, intelligent men to stay home too.,1
We will Make America Proud Again.,0
We will Make America Safe Again.,0
Now, this is all part of his scorched earth campaign.,1
We will Make America Great Again.,0
It goes against everything we stand for.,1
And you know how we stop him?,1
Thank you, and God bless.,0
By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.,1
In 62 days, we are going to win this state ... and we are going to win the White House.,0
We need more of everybody to vote ... more women, more young people, more people of color, more African Americans, more Latinos, everybody.,1
Let's break every record that we've ever had for voting.,1
Let's make that the story of this election.,1
And here in Florida you can, as you often have, make the difference.,1
This is our chance to end years of injustice, corruption and betrayal.,0
Right, Florida?,1
If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote, if you go out and talk to people today and every day about what's at stake in this election, then we will make history.,1
We will win up and down the ballot.,1
This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years.,0
For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests?,0
And I feel strongly about this, because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers, not problem-makers.,1
That's why I hope you'll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.,1
This is the year we can finally fix it.,0
That's because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system.,0
He will be an independent voice for Florida families.,1
We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.,0
And this is important: Unlike his opponent, Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
Now, here's some really good news.,1
We just reached a milestone.,1
More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote.,1
That is the highest number ever.,1
We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems.,0
So to every American who has been waiting for real change, your wait is over ... your moment of liberation is at hand.,0
A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy, to heal our economy, and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country.,0
The change will begin my first day in office.,0
And that includes 50 million young people.,1
That's the most in history.,1
And you know what else?,1
More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election.,1
First, we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land.,0
Then, we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border.,0
And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida.,1
Now, you only see numbers like we're seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in.,1
This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs, as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth.,0
But that's just the beginning.,0
I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
Under Senate rules, that bill can be passed with 51 votes ... meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon.,0
Americans are coming together, and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division, rejecting Donald Trump's demeaning treatment of women, his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people, his lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.,1
I'll tell you, we have learned who Donald Trump is.,1
Now it's up to us to show who we are.,1
It's going to be a very busy first day.,0
I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region.,0
My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
She is running to be America's Angela Merkel.,0
I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so.,0
This is the measure that is called for under current law, and I will enforce it.,0
The Secretary of State is required to take this action, but Hillary Clinton refused to do so ... resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S. communities.,0
And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what we're against, it's about what we're for.,1
It's about a common vision that we share for a hopeful, dynamic, unified America where everyone counts, everyone has a place, everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead, where women are respected ... where veterans are honored, where workers are paid fairly, where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.,1
Furthermore, I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed ... this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy.,0
I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal, and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified.,0
We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina.,0
Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA, she supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and she supported the TPP.,0
She just does whatever her donors tell her to do.,0
In a Trump Administration, we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers ... not on behalf of global corporations.,0
So my friends, it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot.,1
We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets ... and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First.,0
Crucially, I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS.,0
Everything we care about is at stake ... your future ... making college affordable, helping you pay back your debt ... the cost of prescription drugs down ... protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes.,1
Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission.,0
Fighting climate change is at stake.,1
For years, we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C.,0
The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Egypt, China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton.,0
LGBT equality is at stake.,1
I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals, active duty military officers, and top military experts who know how to win ... and know how to keep us out of endless war.,0
Today, 88 retired U.S. generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement.,0
Equal pay for women is at stake.,1
In the end, we know that American dream itself is at stake.,1
Now, did any of you see the debates?",1
<i>Audience:</i> "Yes.",1
<i>Clinton:</i> "Well, I'll tell you, I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates, four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
But I have to tell you, he said a lot of things that were troubling.,1
But in that last debate, he said something that was truly horrifying.,1
That's one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton.,0
He is the first person of a major party, Republican or Democrat, ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election.,1
She favors what has been called military adventurism ... rushing to invade countries, displacing millions of families, then inviting the refugees into our country ... creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS.,0
Now, we can think about every issue we care about, but you know, after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody, now he's attacking the institutions of democracy.,1
I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability ... instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history.,0
We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
And so it comes down to this.,1
We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton ... her legacy of failure in the Middle East, Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before.,0
As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts, we are going to rebuild our depleted military.,0
This is the ultimate deterrent.,0
We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.,0
When your kids and grandkids ask, 'What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line,' I want you to be able to say you voted for a better, fairer, stronger America.,1
And the way we're going to do that: We're going to turn everybody out.,1
Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County.,1
Every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. until November 5th you can vote.,1
The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island.,1
I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military.,0
Right now, we have the smallest air force since 1947, the smallest army since 1939, and one of the smallest Navy's since 1917.,0
So don't wait one more day.,1
Like the Cold War, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets.,0
Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security.,0
Go vote, and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.,1
Now, I know ...,1
I know that we've got our canvass organizers up here.,1
I don't want to take too much of their time because they are workers, they are organized, they are focused.,1
I'm so grateful to them and to you, and we need you.,1
We need you.,1
Stakes couldn't be higher.,1
We got to do everything we can.,1
We can't have someone in the Oval Office who doesn't understand the meaning of the word confidential.,0
I don't want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying, 'Oh, I wish I had just done a little more.',1
So help us knock on doors, make phone calls, talk to voters, and ask them, 'When are you going to vote?,1
The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office.,0
Do you know where you're going to cast your ballot?,1
Who will you take with you?',1
If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldn't even get a security clearance.,0
And make sure they know about early voting, already begun here in Florida.,1
Her conduct is disqualifying.,0
And then if you need to, sign up yourselves.,1
We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day.,1
Let's run through what we discovered in those FBI documents.,0
It's important, and we're hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall.,0
And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days.,1
And we're going to win because of you, because of hardworking volunteers like you.,1
And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump, stage an intervention.,1
Remember, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.,1
It's clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information.,0
She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system, then she told the FBI she didn't understand that the letter "C" meant confidential in the documents she emailed.,0
On 39 separate occasions she said she couldn't recall details about her mishandling of classified information, and she couldn't even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldn't get into her server.,0
And think about it this way.,1
On January 20th, we're going to have a new president.,1
Keep in mind, that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program.,0
And I'll tell you what, I will be proud to build on the progress we've made under President Obama and go even further.,1
But I can't do any of the things that I'm talking about, any of the plans that I have, unless you help me.,1
It's also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions.,0
After her private server was revealed last March, her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery, called BleachBit.,0
So that's what I'm asking you.,1
That's why I came to Daytona Beach today.,1
They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldn't be turned over later ... and by the way, who uses 12 different phones in 4 years?,0
I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days.,1
Let's give every American a chance to chart their own future, make their own contributions.,1
The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very, very shady activity.,0
People who have nothing to hide don't smash phones with hammers.,0
People who have nothing to hide don't bleach their emails, or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law.,0
Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents, then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clinton's private attorney.,0
Let's build a future we can all be proud of, and let's make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate. ,1
Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldn't recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times ... and that's in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th.,0
No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes.,0
Thank you.,1
Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors.,0
It's called pay-for-play.,0
One example of pay-for-play is what the Clinton's did in Haiti.,0
Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country.,0
This was Secretary Clinton's first campaign speech after FBI director James Comey reopened the investigation into Clinton's private email server.,1
Thank you.,1
Thank you.,1
We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake.,0
But while Haiti has suffered, the Clintons and their pals have cashed in.,0
I -- I got to -- I got to say, after hearing -- after hearing from these two extraordinary men I -- I feel all fired up and ready to go for the next five days.,1
Bill and Hillary's brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti, and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company.,0
Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments.,0
In one deal, Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers' rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti.,0
It is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U.S.,1
The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft.,0
People are asking: where did all the money go?,0
Congressman David Price I saw right there.Thank you, David.,1
This November, it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places.,0
State Senator Dan Blue Jr., I know, right there.,1
One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clinton's policies are African-Americans.,0
She sees them only as votes, not as people worthy of a better future.,0
Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country, we will honor and protect their achievements.,0
Thank you, Dan.And I'm not sure she's still here, but Deborah Ross, who I hope is your next senator.,1
That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent.,0
There she is!,1
Because everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates.,1
But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty, joblessness and failing schools.,0
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty, sixty, seventy years and more.,0
4 in 10 African-American children in poverty, including 45% of those under the age of six.,0
58% of African-American youth are not working.,0
And we are so hopeful that you will vote for them and vote for what they represent.,1
2,900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.,0
Nationwide, African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22.,0
This is a national crisis ... and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States.,0
To those suffering in crime and poverty, I say: give Donald J. Trump a chance.,0
What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change?,0
Now, I really want to thank my friend, Bernie Sanders, for everything that he has done.,1
I -- I got to serve with Bernie.,1
We are going to bring back your jobs, rebuild your cities, and give parents and students school choice.,0
We were colleagues in the Senate.,1
I will never, ever, ever take you for granted.,0
I saw firsthand his commitment to the people of Vermont and to the values that have guided his life.,1
And when we faced each other in the primary, here's what I was so proud about.,1
We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda.,0
We ran a campaign on the issues that matter to the American people.,1
We believe every American has the right to a safe community, a great education and government that protects their jobs.,0
And I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie.,1
And I've got to say, too, this election has been a lot more fun now that we're on the same side.,1
This weekend, I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson.,0
It was an incredible and deeply moving experience.,0
I will fight for Detroit, for Chicago, for Baltimore, and for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday, from 1 John 4: "No one has ever seen God; but, if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.",0
And I want to thank Bernie for everything he's done.,1
He's crisscrossing our country, energizing people, getting folks off the sidelines and engaged in politics.,1
And there's no question that his efforts are paying off.,1
Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a New American Future.,0
In this future, we will respect the dignity of all Americans ... and that means great jobs, great schools, and great neighborhoods.,0
And what he said at the beginning of his remarks is absolutely true.,1
My name may be on the ballot, but it is not about me, it's not about my opponent, it's not about Bernie, it's not about David or Deborah, it is about you and your lives and what we're going to do together.,1
We will keep our children safe ... which requires secure borders, a strong military, and supporting law enforcement.,0
Now, Bernie and I have already worked, we've worked on the plan that he told you about to make college tuition-free for the middle-class, for working families, for poor kids and debt-free for everyone.,1
Because as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people.,1
Jobs will return, prosperity will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
So I am proud to be here with you and I am so excited about -- of the election, about everything that we're going to do together.,1
And I'm especially pleased to have Pharrell here.,1
Government corruption will end ... and the State Department will answer to the voters, not Hillary Clinton's donors.,0
Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and, come November 8th, we will once again have a government of, by and for the people.,0
Now, every time I see him, which is not often enough, we always have a good conversation like we did before this event.,1
We Will Make America Proud Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
He always gets you to think.,1
And Will Make America Great Again.,0
Not only is he a world-class talent, but he is a passionate advocate for issues that are too often overlooked and ignored.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child.,1
Come November, we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House ... and we are going to bring back your jobs.,0
So tell me this, tell me this, North Carolina, tell me, North Carolina, are you really, really, really happy that we're here tonight?,1
We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.,0
Well, we sure are.,1
There's nowhere we'd rather be.Now, let me ask you this, how many of you have already voted?Well, I hope you're going to bring more people to vote as well, right?Are you ready to volunteer?,1
We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.,0
We can all use you in these last days.,1
Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper?,1
Well, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology.And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina.,1
We are going to stop the foreign cheating.,0
The era of economic surrender is over.,0
A new era of American Greatness is beginning.,0
No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.,0
Now, are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate?,1
I'll tell you -- I'll tell you, Deborah and her race are the talk of everywhere.,1
People know she will be an independent voice for North Carolina families, that she will represent you with integrity and excellence.,1
Hillary Clinton backed her husband's NAFTA, she backed China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
One bad deal after another.,0
Hillary Clinton's donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.,0
Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.,0
Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.,0
And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
This subtracts directly from our growth ... our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.,0
Are you ready now to choose our next president and commander-in- chief?,1
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton.,0
I am promising a new legacy for America.,0
Well, I'm -- I'm excited.,1
We are going to create a New American Future.,0
But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.,0
Did any of you see the debates?Well, you know, there's several -- there's several notable aspects of those debates.,1
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.,0
I mean, one is the very fact that I stood on the stage for four and a half hours with my opponent proving, once and for all, I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief.,1
But you know -- but you know, he -- he also kept saying, like oh, well you know, what have you done for the last 30 years?,1
And you know, occasionally I would interject and say what I had done.,1
And today, in Greenville, we had a perfect comparison.,1
I started my career fighting for children and families with the Children's Defense Fund when I got right out of law school in the 1970's.,1
Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the "Gold Standard", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.,0
I went to South Carolina to gather evidence to stop the government in South Carolina for -- from putting young men, teenagers in jails with adults.,1
We won't let that happen.,0
I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve.,1
I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education.,1
And as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story.,1
She was a nurse in New York City back in the 1970's, excited about being a young nurse, getting her career off to a start.,1
And she was looking for a place to live, and she had a budget like everybody does.,1
And she found what she thought would be the perfect place.,1
We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.,0
We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.,0
It's going to be America First.,0
My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.,0
Here are a few of the things we will do:,0
A massive tax cut for working Americans.,0
We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration's new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.,0
It was within her budget.,1
Hillary Clinton says she wants to "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.",0
It was close to work.,1
Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.,0
She went to apply for an apartment.,1
We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work ... and we are going to get your energy bills down.,0
It was a new building -- brand new building.,1
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.,0
It wasn't even totally finished yet.,1
We are going to create jobs for all of our people, and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education, and a great job.,0
She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said, "Oh, we don't have any apartments.",1
She said, "But I saw the advertisement.",1
"Well, we have no apartments left.",1
Well, she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father, Fred, had been told there were no apartments.,1
So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination.,1
Another major part of our agenda is immigration security.,0
We need to protect American jobs.,0
We need to protect American safety.,0
Last night, I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs, safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms.,0
I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border, put the cartels out of business, and to keep jobs in our hemisphere.,0
Let's also talk about government corruption.,0
They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.,1
So when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.,1
And I was also very, very grateful.,1
I had a role in helping to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady, and let me tell you, one of the great -- one of the great honors as I travel across the country is meeting young people who are the beneficiaries or meeting their families.,1
No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.,0
Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.,0
I met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born.,1
As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America's uranium supply to the Russians.,0
Her daughter, she was deaf.,1
And the doctors all said she'll never -- she'll never communicate, so she cannot learn to speak, so you need to teach her sign language.,1
And the mom did all this research and concluded that there were some treatments that might help her daughter, but she didn't have that kind of money.,1
Clinton's approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars.,0
They didn't have that kind of insurance.,1
And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, "You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
It's for people who are not poor, but they don't make enough money to afford that kind of insurance, and they don't work for an employer who provides it.,1
In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations.,0
You should look into it.",1
In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.,0
Here is another example of pay-for-play.,0
And she did.,1
And that began the process of her getting the treatment that her daughter needed.,1
In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments ... including Sudan, Syria, and Iran.,0
Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.,0
And when I met the mother, I also met the daughter, right here.,1
I talked with her.,1
She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University.,1
So, yes, you know, I do sweat the details and I do have a lot of plans.,1
Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called "Stronger Together" telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together.,1
In June 2011, Hillary Clinton's state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.,0
During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 ... his highest paying speech.,0
And as your -- as a senator, I helped to rebuild New York City after 9/11 and provided health care to our brave first responders.,1
As your secretary of state, I traveled to 112 countries, negotiated cease-fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and LGBT rights all around the world.,1
In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria ...but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson's work in Iran.,0
A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.,0
No one will be above the law.,0
And you know, everything I've done started by listening to people.,1
Listening to hear your stories, what you're worried about, and then working to bring people together to find common ground, even with people who disagreed with me on lots of issues.,1
You know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care.,1
We will have one set of rules for everyone.,0
In Hillary Clinton's world, we have one set of rules for her ... and another set of rules for everyone else.,0
He and his wife had fostered children, and I called him up.,1
I said, "Congressman, would you work with me to change the laws on foster care and adoption?",1
I am fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.,0
There was a silence.,1
The forgotten men and women of America.,0
I am your voice.,0
He said, "Well, what do you want me to do?",1
Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.,0
My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.,0
Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.,0
I said, "Well, come to the White House.,1
Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.,0
We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.,0
We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.,0
We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don't support our tolerant values.,0
Come to a meeting.,1
My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.,0
My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill.,0
My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.,0
My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers.,0
We'll sit down and figure out what we can do.",1
And we did, and I meet those kids, and I meet those families, kids who were taken out of foster care and given the chance to have a loving permanent family for the first time.,1
My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.,0
My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.,0
My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities.,0
Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.,0
My government reforms will make your voice heard ... not the voice of the special interests.,0
Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.,0
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.,0
Now, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done.,1
Insiders fighting for insiders.,0
I am fighting for you.,0
And if you elect me next Tuesday, that is the kind of president I will be.,1
So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.,1
But as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president.,1
It will either be me or my opponent.,1
Now, I think it's fair to say, things are going to change.,1
Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.,0
Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.,0
Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.,0
I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.,0
Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.,0
I am fighting ... all of us across the country are fighting ... for peaceful regime change in our own country.,0
The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.,0
Change is part of life.,1
That much is certain.,1
I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.,0
The question is what kind of change are we going to see?,1
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity ... a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.,0
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.,0
To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.,0
Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make American Safe Again.,0
Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless.,0
I want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.,1
We are doing so well in Iowa, a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points.,0
It's hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women, mocked the disabled, insulted African-Americans and Latinos, pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together.,1
That is, unfortunately though, what we have seen in this campaign, what we have seen, what's been said and how distressful it's been.,1
I know there are a lot of people who are upset about what's going on in this campaign, aren't there?,1
On November 8, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.,0
We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.,0
People come and talk to me.,1
I've had people say that they can't sleep, that their stomachs are bothering them, they have headaches.,1
And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision.,1
And as Michelle Obama has said, the presidency doesn't change you -- who you are, it reveals who you are.,1
We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.,0
And I think it's fair to say that my opponent has already revealed who he is.,1
Lower taxes, less regulation, more affordable childcare, fair trade deals, secure borders, thriving family farms, and millions and millions of new jobs.,0
We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.,0
And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States.,1
Our country is founded on religious freedom.,1
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders.,0
I am an outsider fighting for you.,0
It is one of the most important building blocks of our democracy.,1
He has said that he thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and des-pair.,1
He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.,1
He seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.,1
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.,0
In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.,0
And we saw that again in the way he treated the Central Park Five.,1
These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14, who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990.,1
She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.,0
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.,0
Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids.,1
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.,0
And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton ... or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks.,0
She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia.,0
Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.,1
And in addition, someone else confessed to the crime, so they were finally released from prison.,1
She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
We can't let that happen.,0
That's why you have to go out and vote on November 8th, and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow.,0
She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.,0
But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, "They should still be in prison.",1
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.,0
Evidence didn't matter.,1
The law didn't matter.,1
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.,0
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.,0
To him, those kids would always be guilty.,1
So think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America?,1
Do we want him appointing our judges?,1
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.,0
<i>Audience:</i> No!,1
The Clintons have perfected the politics of profit.,0
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?,1
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
<i>Audience:</i> No!,1
That's why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are.,1
She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power ... to keep their control over this country.,0
And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that.,1
They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive.,1
We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
The American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways.,0
They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.,0
How many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another?,0
They are the sordid past.,0
We want to lift people up, not tear each other down.,1
And that's why I do believe we are stronger together, so let me paint you a different picture.,1
We are the bright future.,0
While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.,0
Here's what we're going to do together.,1
We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America.,1
What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not have happened and it should never be accepted.,1
Never in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton.,0
People painted the words "Vote Trump" on the side and then set it on fire.,1
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.,0
It's time for real change ... a new foreign policy, a new economic policy, a new immigration policy, a new trade policy.,0
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.,0
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton ... they are too smart, and they know they are being used.,0
Who would do that?,1
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over ... she never does, and that will never change.,0
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators.",0
Same thing goes for Hispanic voters ... they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.,0
Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.,0
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.,0
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
I am running to be President of the United States of America.,0
Who would do that to a place of worship where people seek solace?,1
That can never be normal.,1
From now on, it's going to be America First.,0
It can never be acceptable.,1
Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?,0
What happened in Flint, Michigan, as Bernie said, can never be normal, can never be acceptable.,1
Little children drinking and bathing in poisoned water that will affect their health for years to come.,1
Why can't we have the schools we want, and the borders we want, and the security we want?,0
Why can't we have policies that support small business, or family farms, or the miners and the steelworkers?,0
And then we know, don't we?,1
The answer is simple.,0
Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence.,1
We know their names; Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner and Sandra Bland and Keith Scott and so many others.,1
We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that.,1
Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.,0
We are going to - we are going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and we're going to replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.,1
And we're going to start with our youngest kids and their families to give them the support that they need.,1
And we're going to take a hard look at what we need to do to make sure every child has the chance to attend good schools with good teachers, no matter what their ZIP code is.,1
These special interests control Hillary Clinton.,0
And we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end.,1
She is their chosen representative.,0
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money.,0
It is wrong, my friends, that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.,1
She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors.,0
Look at her career.,0
When I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform.,1
I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration.,1
She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.,0
Too many families have been broken up, too many communities have been so badly affected.,1
She's failed at everything.,0
We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing.,1
She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt.,0
We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.,1
She failed on Russia, on China, on North Korea.,0
She failed upstate New York.,0
She failed the inner cities.,0
She's failed women and children.,0
And we have to restore trust between police and communities.,1
I've created thousands of jobs for women in this country, of incredible talent.,0
Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty.,0
And she has been a disaster on our borders.,0
I'd like to invite on up here Michelle Root, the mother of Sarah Root, who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton.,0
Hillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities.,0
We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.,1
This is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us.,1
This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all.,1
Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah?,0
The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.,0
Just Follow The Money.,0
Too often, despite the progress we've made, we fall short of that goal, and we have to be honest about it.,1
I am determined to make this one of the most important projects of my presidency and I hope all of you will join me in doing that.,1
And I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes.,1
We have 33,000 people a year dying from guns.,1
Her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up.,0
I just cannot tolerate this any longer.,1
Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors ... we're taking them on for YOU.,0
I have met the families of those who have lost loved ones, who have lost the first graders in Sandy Hook, the bible study churchgoers in Charleston, the club-goers in Orlando, the moviegoers in Aurora, Colorado, people going about their lives being cut down and cut senselessly short.,1
We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.,1
And we've got to make investments in those communities that are struggling, especially communities of color.,1
So you can have the future you want.,0
That includes keeping your family safe.,0
New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.,0
60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American.,0
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty.,0
I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.,0
I will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities.,0
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations ... including on our farmers ... negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
When I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew, people who didn't have very much to start with, who lost everything, farmers with 100, 200 acres growing sweet potatoes, wiped out.,1
We've got to help everybody get ahead.,1
I believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child ... including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.,0
And I think hardworking Americans deserve a raise and women deserve equal pay.,1
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
Remember: Follow the Money.,0
So, how are we going to do this?,1
Well, we're going to go where the money is.,1
Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
They're all part of the same political establishment.,0
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.,0
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.,0
Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.,1
I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.,0
And I can't wait to work with Bernie to make public colleges and universities like N.C. State right here at Raleigh tuition-free.,1
I know that this is another issue Pharrell feels passionately about as well.,1
If you're struggling with student debt, we're going to cut that and help you pay it back and get out from under it.,1
Government will start working again.,0
And in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work.,1
So we could go on all night.,1
Fixing things is what I do.,0
Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.,0
I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do.,1
But of course, we can't do anything if you don't get out and vote and get everybody you know to vote.,1
This is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads.,1
It's not just who my opponent is.,1
Pharrell is right, we don't even have to mention his name very much.,1
An article in the New York Post was published recently called "How Donald Trump helped save New York City.",0
Right?,1
It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns.,1
It's about who we are.,1
The article said, quote: "Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out... Trump ... almost by force of will ... rode to the rescue.,0
Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.",0
That's what I want to do for our country ...,0
I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.,0
It's about what we want, what we're going to do to make our mark on our country at this time in our history.,1
Together, we can accomplish anything we want.,0
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th ... and it means you need to start voting early.,0
Early voting is so important.,0
I believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do.,1
You have to knock on doors.,0
Every social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity.,1
You have to pick up that phone.,0
It's not easy.,1
It wasn't easy to get the vote for women.,1
It wasn't easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the Civil Rights Act was enforced.,1
It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down.,1
You have to campaign on the streets.,0
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.,0
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.,0
Visit our website to find out how you can help.,0
You have six weeks until the election.,0
And right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right?,1
You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.,0
And some people got discouraged about that.,1
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.,0
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
I've met some people who say, well, you know, I don't even know what they want, what kind of identification.,1
It gets a little discouraging.,1
You cannot get discouraged.,1
Do not grow weary while doing good, right?,1
It is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise.,1
This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
And in this election, President Obama's entire legacy is on the line, everything that he has worked so hard to do against implacable opposition.,1
Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.,0
As the president said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent upon him being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he believes in.,1
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:,0
I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
So I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am.,1
But I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote.,1
Early vote and vote on Tuesday if you can't get to early vote.And listen to this, more than two million right here in North Carolina have already voted.,1
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
So make no mistake about it, you can make the difference, not only in who you elect, but in the agenda that those people will then get to work on.,1
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
I want you to hold me accountable.,1
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
I want you to be my partners, but I can't do any of this.,1
You know, when I was with our wonderful first lady last week, she reminded ...she reminded the big crowd we had in Winston-Salem that President Obama in 2008 won this state by about 14,000 votes. ,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
If you break that down, you know what the difference between winning and losing is?,1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
Roughly two votes per precinct.,1
So don't let anybody tell you their vote doesn't matter.,1
You've got to get everyone you know to come out and vote.,1
You can vote early through this Saturday, November 5th.,1
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
If you don't know where to vote, go to iwillvote.com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
And then that will be the story of this election.,1
Let's make that one for the history books.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll ... and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that's despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.,0
Please be part of what we're doing in these next days and let's make sure that we not only have a future we can believe in, but one we can help create together, and demonstrate, once and for all, that love trumps hate. ,1
Thank you all.,1
On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
Secretary Clinton was introduced by both Senator Bernie Sanders and Pharrell Williams.,1
Williams is a Grammy award winning song-writer, rapper, and record producer.,1
I am so, so grateful to Jos.. for that wonderful introduction.,1
He's an incredibly talented chef, but more than that, I have to say he's a humanitarian.,1
It's going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.,0
We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.,0
Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.,0
He just came back from Haiti, once again, where he goes periodically to help feed people.,1
He's been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake, going to help people in remote villages ... and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook, primarily women and children, without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke.,1
I enlisted Jos..'s help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative.,1
I am an outsider fighting for you.,0
One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country.,0
Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.,0
And as you heard, he's also a proud immigrant and ... he is standing up to Donald Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric, and he's doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business.,1
New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.,0
This is a national crisis.,0
Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police.,0
First, she calls our supporters ... many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters ... deplorable and irredeemable.,0
Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of "implicit bias," ... essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.,0
He'd been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today, in Washington, and after Jos.. heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants, he said, 'No, I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel.',1
That is really gutsy.,1
And today was a perfect time to have Jos.. be with us because, as I said, Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel.,1
And yesterday, here in Florida, he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them. ,1
Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself.,0
After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as "super-predators.",0
How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?,0
And today, in opening that hotel, I think it's important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers.,1
How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?,0
The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign.,1
So, like with so much else that Donald Trump says, he says one thing and then he does something different.,1
By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.,0
Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States, and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes.,1
That is the way that he does business.,1
She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.,0
Now, we've actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy.,1
He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas.,1
The police officers she attacks are the same people ... of all colors and nationalities ... who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.,0
Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.,0
He stiffs small businesses.,1
My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities.,0
We are going to save thousands of lives.,0
I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman.,1
And I've met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump ... provided pianos for one of his casinos, installed drapes for one of his hotels, laid the marble, put in the glass, washed the dishes, painted ... and then weren't paid.,1
I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.,1
So I'm grateful to Jos.. and I want to thank everyone else ... my great friend, your United States Senator Bill Nelson.,1
The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don't want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities.,0
They don't want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens.,0
Congresswoman Kathy Castor.,1
They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.,0
Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who's here with his two daughters.,1
Governor Charlie Crist, soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist.,1
Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.,0
I have to say, we've got two great candidates here: David Singer, candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier, another candidate.,1
I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.,0
I will never back down from fighting to save America's inner cities.,0
And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.,1
The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks.,0
Follow The Money.,0
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.,0
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton ... they are too smart, and they know they are being used.,0
So, my friends, here's the advice that I got.,1
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over ... she never does, and that will never change.,0
It is a beautiful day in Tampa, but it's warm.,1
And some of you have been here a while, right?,1
Same thing goes for Hispanic voters ... they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.,0
And I'm watching the flags.,1
So long as they're waving, I know there's a breeze.,1
If they stop waving, I'm really going to cut this short.,1
58% of African-American youth don't have jobs.,0
There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours.,0
45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.,0
But let me start by thanking you ... thanking you for being here. ,1
The inner cities have been left behind.,0
[<i>Chants of "Hillary!,1
Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it's dangerous to walk down the street with your child.,0
"</i>] ,1
Thank you.,1
To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose?,0
Thank you.,1
Well, I'll tell you, if I ever need a pickup, I'm coming back to Tampa, Mayor.,1
And with 13 days left in this election, we cannot stop for a minute.,1
No complacency here.,1
Nobody... nobody flagging.,1
We've got to get everybody out to vote.,1
And I hope in addition to the people that I've mentioned, someone who's not here I hope you will support ... that is Congressman Patrick Murphy, to send him to the United States Senate. ,1
Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.,0
I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.,0
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.,0
I think you'll be pleased because he's an independent voice.,1
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
He's a problem-solver.,1
Follow The Money.,0
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
He believes in comprehensive immigration reform.,1
He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered.,1
Follow The Money.,0
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration.,1
He'll stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures.,1
Follow The Money.,0
The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
He'll defend Social Security and Medicare, not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs.,1
So please, do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.,1
Follow The Money.,0
She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power ... to keep their control over this country.,0
In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.,0
Now, I got to ask you, anybody see the last debate?,1
You know, I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job. ,1
She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.,0
And every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a ... yeah, 'Wrong' ... he does have a way of saying, I just keep remembering Michelle Obama's words: when he goes low, we go high.,1
She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office.,0
But I got to say, he said something in the last debate we've never heard from anybody running for president.,1
He basically said that he's not sure ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election.,1
It's all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.,0
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.,0
Now, this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged, so you can't really take what he says very seriously.,1
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.,0
But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.,1
And don't forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton ... or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds.,0
She even gave up 20% of America's uranium supply to Russia.,0
She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale ... and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.,0
And if you are casting doubts, you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election, that is contrary to who we are as Americans.,1
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.,0
We have our elections; we've had them from George Washington forward.,1
We're going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.,1
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.,0
I believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark, divisive vision of America, and it's happening, my friends.,1
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.,0
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.,0
The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons' scandals and corruption.,0
We have reached a milestone.,1
More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote.,1
That's the biggest number ever.,1
This will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough.,0
Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.,0
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.,0
And that number includes 50 million young people.,1
And you know what else?,1
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
More than 10 million people have already voted, including 2 million right here in Florida. ,1
I am running to be President of the United States of America.,0
From now on, it's going to be America First.,0
I'm hearing some great stories from people.,1
Let me just tell you one.,1
These special interests control Hillary Clinton.,0
She is their chosen representative.,0
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money.,0
She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.,0
It's about Steven, from St. Augustine.,1
He's been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease.,1
He's been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years.,1
Look at her career.,0
But he knows how important his vote is.,1
She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.,0
She's failed at everything.,0
So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank, which I would not have recommended ... clung to his walker, stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America.,1
She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt.,0
And if Steven can do that, nobody has any excuses.,1
She failed on ISIS ... in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.,0
She failed upstate New York ... promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left.,0
All she did was name a post office and a highway.,0
And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents, and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here, across Florida, and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.,1
We have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America, and I just find that so intolerable.,1
She failed the inner cities.,0
Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa.,1
She's failed women and children.,0
The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.,0
Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors ... we're taking them on for YOU.,0
So you can have the future you want.,0
I'm not owned or controlled by anyone ... my loyalty is to you, and no one else.,0
It's a cosmopolitan city.,1
Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like, and we need to be lifting each other up, listening to each other, respecting each other, not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry.,1
I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.,0
And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together, and I'm going to need your help.,1
We're going to get the economy working for everybody, not just people at the top, with new jobs in infrastructure.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,0
We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child ... including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America.,0
We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.,0
That rail system, Bob, that you want, we're going to get it because it would help you so much.,1
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
Follow the Money.,0
Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
They're all part of the same rigged political establishment.,0
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.,0
Think of the people we'd put to work ... technology, innovation, research, advanced manufacturing, and yes, small business.,1
And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.,0
Government will start working for you again.,0
Fixing things is what I do.,0
Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.,0
I want to be the best small business president you can have, to help people start and grow their businesses.,1
But we're also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century.,1
That's what I want to do for our country ...,0
I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.,0
Together, we can accomplish anything we want.,0
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th ... and it means you need to start voting early.,0
I know we can create millions of jobs, and we can protect Florida, especially coastal Florida, and we can protect our planet at the same time.,1
Early voting is already underway.,0
You're already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida.,1
I was just in Miami, and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain.,1
People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke, but it's the oceans rising.,1
So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida, and that's exactly what we're going to do.,1
We're also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free.,1
You have to knock on doors.,0
If your family makes less than $125,000, which is most families in America, you're not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university.,1
You have to pick up that phone.,0
If your family makes more than that, you're not going to have to go into debt ... pay what you can afford, and then we're going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt, because that drags people down.,1
And for people who already have debt, we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.,1
And I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators.,1
I want to work with you and be a good partner with you.,1
And I think there should be more than one way, more than just a four-year college degree, to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families.,1
So let's invest in more technical education in high school, in our community colleges.,1
You have to campaign on the streets.,0
Let's have more apprenticeship programs ... labor and business together.,1
But while we grow the economy, let's make it fairer.,1
We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time aren't left in poverty.,1
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.,0
I got to tell you, I was raised to believe in hard work.,1
My grandfather was a factory worker, my dad had a small business, and we really believed you've got to work for what you get in life, right?,1
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.,0
But if you're working, you shouldn't be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.,1
And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women's work?,1
You know, this is not just a women's issue.,1
This is a family issue.,1
Visit our website to find out how you can help.,0
You have six weeks until the election.,0
If you've got a mother, a wife, a sister, or a daughter working, it's your issue.,1
And unlike my opponent, we're going to ask the wealthy, the millionaires and billionaires, to pay their fair share, because we're going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter.,1
And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year.,1
You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.,0
You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.,0
Don't let it slip away.,0
So when you go to the polls, vote to grow the economy, more jobs with rising incomes, vote to make the economy fairer.,1
Don't let this chance go.,0
Stand up and be heard ... for your family, for your city, for your country.,0
And compare that with what my opponent has proposed.,1
He really believes if you give trillions ... that's trillions with a 't' ... trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy, millionaires, billionaires, big corporations, everything will trickle down.,1
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
Now, we know that doesn't work; we've seen it.,1
And it's pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich, who hasn't paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years.,1
This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.,0
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:,0
I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
He says not making taxes makes him smart.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
Well, I don't know.,1
I don't know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year.,1
And besides, what kind of genius loses money running a casino, for heaven's sakes?,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
Actually, it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here.,1
But this means he's contributed zero, okay?,1
He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster.,1
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
Not only is he wrong, but what right does he have to say that?,1
He hasn't contributed a penny to our military, not a penny to our veterans, not a penny to health care or education, not a penny to highways or infrastructure.,1
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
This is a false ... false ... charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
And I'll tell you something; we did a little research.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
He's been denigrating America for decades.,1
I've come to know and love the people of New Hampshire.,0
You are strong, independent and you are free.,0
We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.,0
This didn't start with his birther lie against President Obama.,1
We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.,0
It didn't even start running against me.,1
We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.,0
We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.,0
We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.,0
Back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan.,1
He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world.,1
So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself.,1
And at some point, you got to say, wait a minute, we're better than that.,1
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.,0
We are stronger than that.,1
We want to forward ... forward ... into the future with confidence and optimism, and that's what we're offering in this campaign.,1
I got to tell you, it is not just what we're against that should motivate you to go to the polls; it's what we are for.,1
And I believe strongly that what we're for will make it possible for all of us, and especially our kids and our grandkids, to have the best future.,1
I am an outsider fighting for you.,0
America's best days can still be ahead of us.,1
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.,0
But we can't make any of this happen if we don't have you voting.,1
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
Follow the money.,0
Now, Donald Trump says he can still win, and he's right.,1
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
That's why it's so important everyone gets out and votes.,1
Follow the money.,0
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy ... they are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
And here in Florida ... in a lot of places, you can only vote on Election Day, but here in Florida, voting couldn't be easier.,1
Early voting began on Monday.,1
Follow the money.,0
The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.,0
In south Florida, it goes through Sunday, November 6 around the state.,1
Again, just follow the money.,0
In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.,0
She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.,0
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.,0
You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.,1
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.,0
In fact, the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here.,1
You can go vote right after this event.,1
And we'll have staff ready to help you get there.,1
And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.,1
Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.,0
But I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks.,1
We're reaching out to everybody.,1
So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer.,1
Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N, and that is 47246.,1
She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale ... and if she ever got the chance, she'd put the Oval Office up for sale too.,0
We can use you.,1
We're making millions of phone calls in Florida.,1
We're knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.,1
We don't want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th, America will have a new president.,1
She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena.,0
I've got to say ... so I've got to say to you that change is inevitable in life.,1
13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer.,0
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals.,0
We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5.,0
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server.,0
Right?,1
Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.,0
She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power ... to keep their control over this country.,0
The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals.,0
And so the real question is, what kind of change are we going to have?,1
And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent.,1
They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.,0
No.,1
I'm serious.,1
I'm serious.,1
After this election, if I'm fortunate enough to be elected, we are going to reach out to everybody.,1
The Clintons are the sordid past.,0
Right?,1
We are the bright future.,0
While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.,0
And ask.,1
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.,0
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities.,0
I don't think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton ... they are too smart, and they know they are being used.,0
Ask the people you're talking to what kind of change they really want because I don't think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart, a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one, going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition, letting Wall Street write its own rules, denying the science of climate change, rolling back marriage equality, defunding Planned Parenthood, the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy, and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons.",1
They also know that she'll do nothing for them once the election is over ... she never does, and that will never change.,0
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators.",0
Same thing goes for Hispanic voters ... they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.,0
A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.,0
<i>Audience:</i> "No.",1
My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> "Now, that may be change, but, boy, that's not the change we need.,1
We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.,0
And my vision is different.,1
It's more hopeful, optimistic, and unifying.,1
Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.,0
I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if that's what you choose.,1
I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good, high-paying jobs and in new industries, like clean energy and advanced manufacturing.,1
I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants, who pay taxes ... and, by the way, one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid.,1
We will unleash the power of American energy ... we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.,0
And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare, where we're respected in the world, working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons.,1
So yes, change is coming, The choice is yours about what kind of change we'll have.,1
And I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because it's not just about winning on November 8th, as important as that is.,1
Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.,0
The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.,0
And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.,0
NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton ... and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved.,0
It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.,1
Tim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president.,1
You've lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization ... another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.,0
So if you will help, we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country. ,1
Let's prove once and for all that love trumps hate.,1
Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership ... which would destroy manufacturing in this state.,0
Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation.,0
Thank you.,1
Secretary Clinton was introduced by Jos.. Andr..s, a famous Spanish-American chef who was awarded the National Humanities Medal in 2016.,1
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.,0
So I couldn't think of a better place to come back to with another woman whose voice we need now more than ever.,1
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
I am running to be President of the United States of America.,0
I want to say what I think is obvious but can't be said enough, and that is this may be one of the most, if not the most important election of our lifetimes, no matter our age.,1
But for young people it will be so consequential because every election is about the future.,1
From now on, it's going to be America First.,0
Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?,0
And this one is about whether we build on the progress we've made, the legacy that President Obama has built or rip it away and go backwards.,1
So we have a lot of work to do.,1
Think about it.,0
And I don't mean just in the presidential race.,1
For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed?,0
Let's be sure to elect Roy Cooper, the next governor of North Carolina.,1
Or for our infrastructure to be repaired?,0
Or for the waste to be removed from the budget?,0
He will always put the people of North Carolina first.,1
And he will repeal HB2 ... because he knows that discrimination is wrong.,1
For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?,0
It's bad for business, and it's against North Carolina's values.,1
And let's send Deborah Ross to the United States Senate.,1
She will be an independent voice for the working families in this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.,1
And unlike her opponent, Deborah Ross has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
And remember, it is not just Roy's name and Deborah's name or my name that's going to be on the ballot.,1
All the things you've ever wanted for your country have been denied.,0
The reason for this is simple.,0
So much of what we care about -- so much that's at stake in the election is, too.,1
It's because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don't want these changes to happen.,0
Voting rights are at stake.,1
And if you care about this sacred right, and want to make sure our leaders of both parties do their part to protect and strengthen it -- not chip away at it, you've got to vote in this election.,1
And so I hope, after all North Carolina has gone through with the efforts to suppress people's votes, you will turn out and say, "No.,1
We demand the right to vote.",1
And supporting our veterans is at stake.,1
If you believe that America should stand with those who served because they served us, then you've got to vote.,1
And so when you think about yourselves, your families, people you know who've worn the uniform of our country, the best way to make clear that we respect the military, and we will do everything we can to make sure they and their families have what they need as they sacrificed for us, is to show up and vote.,1
And climate change is at stake.,1
These special interests control Hillary Clinton.,0
Now, I shouldn't have to say this in 2016, but I will.,1
She is their chosen representative.,0
She's been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.,0
She's there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.,0
If you believe in science, right?,1
Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors ... we're taking them on for YOU.,0
And you know that climate change is real and demands action right now ... you've got to show up and vote in this election.,1
Immigration is at stake.,1
So you can have the future you want.,0
If you believe that we need to fix our broken system, keep families together, and give people who love America a path to citizenship ... you've got to vote.,1
That includes keeping your family safe.,0
New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America's large cities, and that it's the largest single-year increase in 45 years.,0
More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.,0
And marriage equality is at stake, too.,1
If you believe everyone deserves to be treated equally in America, no matter who they are or who they love ... then you've got to turn out and vote in this election.,1
Good jobs that pay good wages are at stake.,1
The failed politicians and the arrogant media don't want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country.,0
Investing in our roads and our bridges and our water systems and all the work that needs to be done in our country.,1
They just want me to go along with the status quo.,0
Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.,0
That really matters, and we can put millions of people to work and have a more competitive economy.,1
We will never back down from fighting to save American lives.,0
That's why we've proposed a very big jobs program, because I don't want anybody willing to work in this country not to have a good job with a rising income to support themselves and their families.,1
If you believe that, then you've got to come out and vote.,1
That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
And particularly, for all of the students here, affordable college education is at stake.,1
Hillary Clinton can't even say the words.,0
And not only that, relief from student debt that you already have is at stake.,1
We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs.,0
So if you believe as we do that everyone should be able to afford to go to college and graduate and that everyone should be able to pay down and pay off their debt, then you've got to get out and vote in this election.,1
New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border.,0
The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled ... once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.,0
I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border ... that is a promise.,0
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
And dignity for women and girls.,1
Again, I wish I didn't have to say this, right?,1
But indeed, dignity and respect for women and girls is also on the ballot in this election.,1
And I want to thank our First Lady for her eloquent, powerful defense of that basic value.,1
They're all part of the same corrupt political establishment.,0
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.,0
So I think you're getting the idea here that I think everything we care about is at stake in this election.,1
I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.,0
So you've got to vote ... and get your friends and families and neighbors to vote too.,1
And don't just take it from me because I think you've heard some really compelling voices say the same thing, and one of them is here with us today, right?,1
There are so many things I admire about our First Lady.,1
Michelle reminds us to work hard, stay true to our values, be good to one another and never, ever stop fighting for what we believe in.,1
She has spent eight years as our First Lady advocating for girls around the world to go to school and have the same opportunities as boys.,1
She has worked for healthier childhoods for our kids here at home, better nutrition, more exercise.,1
And we are seeing the results.,1
We actually are seeing kids who are healthier, something that she was determined to try to achieve.,1
Together, we can accomplish anything we want.,0
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.,0
She has encouraged more young people to go to college and follow your dreams, and she has supported America's military families, who serve and sacrifice as well for our country.,1
You have to knock on doors.,0
You have to pick up that phone.,0
Now, it hasn't been all hard work.,1
You have to campaign on the streets.,0
She played a mean round of 'Carpool Karaoke,' and among the many real privileges I've had is to see the President and the First Lady dance.,1
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.,0
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.,0
Wow, one could only hope.,1
Visit our website to find out how you can help.,0
You have 40 days until the election.,0
You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.,0
Now, she also planted an amazing vegetable garden at the White House ... and I can promise you, if I win, I will take good care of it, Michelle.,1
Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.,0
And boy ... thank you!,1
Boy, didn't she dazzle the world with that wise and beautiful speech at the Democratic National Convention this summer?,1
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.,0
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.,0
Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:,0
And I have now, I have now stood on the debate stage for four and a half hours with Donald Trump, and if you see any of those debates, well, that has proved once and for all that I have the stamina to be President and Commander in Chief.,1
But there were times during those three debates, the loop running in my head was what Michelle said at the convention, right?,1
'When they go low, we go high.',1
We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
And on top of all that, just by being herself every day, never missing an opportunity to honor her parents for the hard work and sacrifice that set her on her way, she has shown every little girl and boy in America that there are no limits to what they can achieve if they work hard and do right and believe in themselves.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
Seriously ... is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?,1
And maybe, maybe it's especially meaningful to me because I do know something about being First Lady of the United States, and I'm going to state the obvious.,1
It's not easy.,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
You've got so many people counting on you.,1
You've got the eyes of the world on you.,1
And when you're trying to raise your children as she is and I did, and give them the space and support they need to have as normal and safe and fulfilling childhoods as possible ... that makes it even harder.,1
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
I used to hang out in the main hall on the second floor of the White House around the time Chelsea would come home from school just to be sure I got to see her and see what happened that day and try to figure out what I needed to be thinking about and doing for her.,1
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
And let's be real ... as our first African-American First Lady, she's faced pressures I never did.,1
And she's handled them with pure grace.,1
By any standard, she has been an outstanding First Lady who has made us all so proud.,1
And she and the President, she and the President have been such wonderful friends to me and my family.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
It has just meant the world, the world to me, it really has.,1
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
I want to say just one thing about the First Lady's work.,1
Tremendous polls keep coming in.,0
I mentioned military families.,1
A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide.,0
On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.,0
We are going to take on the big donors, and big business, and big media ... we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped America's wealth to other countries.,0
We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.,0
She's been their fierce champion.,1
And military families have come up against a lot in this election.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
It just made me boil when Donald Trump disrespected a Gold Star family, Mr. and Mrs. Khan.,1
He still hasn't apologized to them.,1
We will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America.,0
He actually made it worse ... just yesterday, he said again that if America had only made him President years ago, their son, Captain Khan, would still be alive.,1
Honestly, I don't -- I don't understand how anyone would want to rub salt in the wounds of a grieving family.,1
We will reduce regulations, which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores.,0
We will unleash American energy, creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs.,0
The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor ... we will remove those restrictions day one.,0
We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare.,0
President Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars.,0
Instead, they surged $5,000.,0
And he keeps insulting our military.,1
Our replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it.,0
It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states, creating a dynamic and competitive new market ... they will be competing for your business.,0
Yesterday, when he heard that a retired Army colonel and former dean of the Army War College said that Donald doesn't understand military strategy, Trump said, 'I'll teach him a couple things.',1
Well actually, Donald, you're the one who's got a lot to learn about the military and everything else that makes America great.,1
We're also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks.,0
High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need.,0
Starting by learning about the dignity and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families.,1
And he should learn from Michelle Obama how a leader supports them, not disrespects them!,1
On trade, we are going to end the international abuse, the foreign cheating, and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization.,0
No one knows the stakes in this election better than our First Lady.,1
Because all the progress that we've achieved under President Obama's leadership is at stake ... he pulled our economy out of the biggest ditch that it was in when he became president.,1
He saved the auto industry, he cracked down on Wall Street, he has tackled healthcare, climate change, civil rights, and so much else.,1
Right now, America eliminates its tariffs, but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets.,0
Our massive, chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class ... and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders.,0
There's a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent.,0
And all the work that we've done to strengthen our relationships with other countries and secure our leadership in the world is also at stake.,1
Now, I for one, and I hope all of you, do not want all that hard work ... by our President and our First Lady and by millions of Americans ... to be wiped away.,1
Hillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests.,0
We cannot let that happen.,1
We've got to do everything in our power to get everyone out to vote.,1
To understand no matter what issue you care about, it truly is on the ballot.,1
I am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women.,0
Now, this has been a hard election at times.,1
It's gotten pretty ugly, hasn't it?,1
My opponent likes to say that for decades, she has been "fighting for women.",0
That she has been "fighting for children.",0
We've all felt it ... especially our kids.,1
Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty, or on the brink of poverty?,0
Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable, reliable quality childcare?,0
You know the old saying, "Watch what I do, not what I say.",0
I hear this from parents and children across our country ... kids write me notes, they hand me little cards and notes when I shake hands with them.,1
At the Trump Organization, and in my campaign for President, women occupy some of the highest positions.,0
I have employed thousands of women in my company.,0
Their parents write to me, teachers talk to me.,1
Kids are scared, kids are scared by the rhetoric they're hearing, right?,1
I see the educators' heads nodding.,1
Little girls hear the ugly things that have been said about women in this campaign, and it makes them feel terrible and doubt themselves ... and that is why it is important for voices, like our First Lady's, to stand up and say, 'Wait a minute, respecting women and girls is so important,' and it is especially important for us to send that message to our children, boys and girls alike.,1
Our kids are scared that they're going to be sent out of the country because their parents are immigrants or they're immigrants.,1
They're scared if they're Muslim, or have a disability.,1
I got a letter from a parent -- a mom from Wisconsin, I think, who adopted her son Felix from Ethiopia when he was a toddler.,1
He just turned 11 years old ... he wrote my campaign to let me know he was now 11 years old.,1
I love it when little kids do little birthday remembrances.,1
America is the only country he's ever known.,1
One day, he turned to his mom and asked, 'If Donald Trump becomes President, is he going to make me go back to Ethiopia?',1
Women of different backgrounds.,0
Women of many talents.,0
And just last week, joined by my daughter, Ivanka, I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare.,0
That plan has many great features, including tax-free childcare savings accounts.,0
Now that honestly breaks my heart.,1
We've got to make sure all our kids know that America has a place for you -- the American Dream is big enough for you.,1
And then, we've got to make sure they learn the right lessons about how to treat people.,1
I saw that sign, I believe in love and kindness, right?,1
Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts, and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits.,0
Well, here's one place to start.,1
Families can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes, a huge tax cut for the middle class.,0
We know that bullying is a real problem in our classrooms, our playgrounds and online ... and teachers have reported that this election has made it worse.,1
We have also talked about improving education.,0
My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America.,0
We are also going to bring down the cost of college.,0
So I want you to know, we're going to launch a major new effort to help states and communities and schools and families end bullying wherever it takes places.,1
Universities get massive federal funds, and huge tax breaks for their endowments ... but then they don't spend those funds or those endowments on their students.,0
I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt.,0
And we will work together to make the internet a safer space for kids, invest in front-line professionals like guidance counselors and social workers and school nurses and psychologists to support kids who've been targeted, like the young woman I met in Iowa who told me she was bullied because of her asthma.,1
This has got to stop.,1
And I can't think of anything more important than making sure every single one of our kids knows that they loved just as they are.,1
This will get to the problem at the source, and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers.,0
So ultimately, my friends, as Michelle reminded us this election is about our kids, and in my case, my grandkids.,1
Their lives and their futures -- nothing is more important to me than that.,1
I've been fighting for kids throughout my career.,1
Our students are drowning and we're going to fix it.,0
Women also value security.,0
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, stop the massive inflow of refugees, protect our borders, and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities.,0
As I campaign across this country, I hear so many stories and pleas, from women especially, about drug addiction and opioid use.,0
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment.,0
But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth, and increasingly, many adults, from the scourge of drugs.,0
I will fight for them every single day of my presidency.,1
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use.,0
So we have a job to do.,1
Starting right now, let's come together.,1
Let's work together.,1
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders.,0
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities, and into our suburbs.,0
This must change.,0
And let's be hopeful and optimistic and unified in the face of division and hate.,1
Bring people together in a spirit of mutual respect to solve shared challenges.,1
Every change starts with a conversation.,0
Together, we will have this conversation.,0
And we will make this change.,0
Let's have each other's backs, lift each other up, not tear each other down.,1
The changes will start immediately.,0
Here, in Virginia, we are going to end the war on American energy.,0
Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work.,0
Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale, and shut down natural gas.,0
The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S. economy over $5 trillion.,0
By the way, less than a week after taking office, Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia, including on people earning as little as $17,000 dollars a year.,0
We are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs, wealth, and cheaper electricity to Virginia.,0
Let's go out and win this election to make sure we do exactly that ... for Roy Cooper, Deborah Ross, and all of us.,1
Another major part of our agenda is safety.,0
Let's make sure you vote early.,1
I believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace.,0
Vote as soon as you can, vote this afternoon.,1
Today, the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture.,0
I'm excited about what we're going to see happen here in North Carolina, and I am so excited to be introducing our amazing First Lady Michelle Obama!,1
Following Secretary Clinton's remarks, Michelle Obama spoke about the importance of the election and emphasized that every vote matters.,1
We congratulate and honor those involved with the project, and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation.,0
"Chairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on healthcare policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity," <b>said President-elect Trump</b>.,1
"He is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to every American.,1
I am proud to nominate him as Secretary of Health and Human Services.",1
African-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation.,0
Many African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country, and I will make sure their success is protected and supported.,0
"It is an honor to be nominated to serve our nation as Secretary of Health and Human Services.,1
At the same time, too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty.,0
Thanks to President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence for their confidence," <b>said Rep. Price</b>.,1
I will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream.,0
That includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice.,0
Democrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more, and produced only more joblessness and poverty.,0
The jobs are leaving, the schools are failing, and crime is rising.,0
"I am humbled by the incredible challenges that lay ahead and enthusiastic for the opportunity to be a part of solving them on behalf of the American people.,1
To those suffering, I say: Vote for Donald Trump.,0
What do you have to lose?,0
There is much work to be done to ensure we have a healthcare system that works for patients, families, and doctors; that leads the world in the cure and prevention of illness; and that is based on sensible rules to protect the well-being of the country while embracing its innovative spirit.",1
Rep. Price was first elected to represent Georgia's 6th district in November 2004.,1
I will fix it.,0
I will fight harder for you than anyone has before.,0
Prior to going to Washington, Price served four terms in the Georgia State Senate ... two as Minority Whip.,1
In 2002, he was a leader in the Republican renaissance in Georgia as the party took control of the State Senate, with Price rising to become the first Republican Senate Majority Leader in the history of Georgia.,1
The policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities ... just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went.,0
Of course, she got rich through it all ... the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State.,0
In Congress, Rep. Price is a proven leader, tireless problem solver and go-to Republican on quality healthcare policy.,1
Worst of all, she put her public office up for sale ... and then bleached her emails, and destroyed her phones, to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena.,0
There's a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clinton's campaign ... and not mine.,0
He serves on the House Committee on Ways and Means.,1
In the 114th Congress, Rep. Price was named Chair of the House Committee on the Budget.,1
In previous Congresses, he has served as Chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee and Chairman of the Republican Study Committee.,1
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system, and who wants nothing to change, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.,0
Committed to advancing positive solutions under principled leadership, Rep. Price has been a fierce opponent of government waste and devoted to limited government and lower spending.,1
For nearly 20 years, Rep. Price worked in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon.,1
Before coming to Washington he returned to Emory University School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor and Medical Director of the Orthopedic Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, teaching resident doctors in training.,1
My campaign is powered by my own money, and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens.,0
95% of our donors are small dollar donations.,0
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you.,0
Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We're trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.,0
They're all part of the same political establishment.,0
He received his Bachelor and Doctor of Medicine degrees from the University of Michigan and completed his Orthopedic Surgery residency at Emory University.,1
They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections.,0
In addition to Chairman Price's nomination, President-elect Trump announced his choice of Seema Verma, one of the leading experts in the country on Medicare and Medicaid, to serve as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.,1
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs, your factories, and your wealth to other countries.,0
I am not running to be President of the World.,0
"I am pleased to nominate Seema Verma to serve as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services," <b>said President-elect Trump</b>.,1
"She has decades of experience advising on Medicare and Medicaid policy and helping states navigate our complicated systems.,1
I am running to be President of the United States.,0
Together, Chairman Price and Seema Verma are the dream team that will transform our healthcare system for the benefit of all Americans.",1
"I am honored to be nominated by President-elect Trump today," <b>said Ms. Verma</b>.,1
I Am For America ... and America First.,0
"I look forward to helping him tackle our nation's daunting healthcare problems in a responsible and sustainable way.",1
Seema Verma is the President, CEO and founder of SVC, Inc., a national health policy consulting company.,1
Together, we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams.,0
Government will start working again.,0
For more than 20 years, Ms. Verma has worked extensively on a variety of policy and strategic projects involving Medicaid, insurance, and public health, working with Governors' offices, State Medicaid agencies, State Health Departments, State Departments of Insurance, as well as the federal government, private companies and foundations. ,1
Fixing things is what I do.,0
Ms. Verma has extensive experience redesigning Medicaid programs in several states.,1
Ms. Verma is the architect of the Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP), the nation's first consumer directed Medicaid program under Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana and then-Governor Pence's HIP 2.0 waiver proposal.,1
Ms. Verma served as the State of Indiana's health reform lead following the passage of Obamacare in 2010.,1
Ms. Verma is a graduate of the Richard G. Lugar Excellence in Public Service Series, and in 2016, Vice President-elect Pence awarded Ms. Verma the Sagamore of the Wabash.,1
Just look at my projects in New York, where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business, activity and opportunity ... where others saw only problems, I saw only potential.,0
Additionally, Ms. Verma was recently selected to participate in the American Enterprise Institute Leadership Network.,1
Prior to consulting, Ms. Verma served as Vice President of Planning for the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County and as a Director with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) in Washington D.C. Ms. Verma received her Master's degree in Public Health, with a concentration in health policy and management from Johns Hopkins University, and her Bachelor's degree in Life Sciences from the University of Maryland.,1
Because, you know what?,1
We turned empty lots into homes, offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families.,0
That's what I want to do for our country ...,0
I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods, the failing schools, the forgotten stretches of this nation, and unlock their potential for all of our people.,0
I've made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be.,0
That's what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy, the passion, the intensity!,1
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses ...,0
I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions.,0
We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be, we've stopped thinking about how great things could be ... all we have to do is tune out the doubters, the cynics, and the naysayers.,0
And our longtime friend, Jon Bon Jovi, was with us.,1
We are a nation of strivers, dreamers, and believers ... and that's the spirit that will carry us to victory in November, and to great victories as a nation.,0
He was with us up in Philadelphia, where he and Bruce Springsteen sang.,1
It's that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana, or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint, Michigan.,0
And Jon said, 'Well, hey, I want to go down to Raleigh,' and so here he is!,1
And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow, we are going to be living on a prayer.,1
It used to be the cars were made in Flint, and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.,0
I was really impressed when everybody's hand went up saying you'd already voted.,1
Well, go find somebody else who hasn't voted, okay?,1
Bring out your friends, your roommates, strangers on the street.,1
Today, cars are made in Mexico, and you can't drink the water in Flint.,0
We'll turn it all around.,0
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.,0
Just stop and talk to them about what's at stake in this election.,1
You have to knock on doors.,0
Because North Carolina is key, and it's not only important for our election.,1
You have to pick up that phone.,0
Go to our website to learn more.,0
You have to campaign on the streets.,0
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.,0
To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote.,0
Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor?,1
Well, I sure hope so.,1
I sure hope so, and I hope you're ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor.,1
You have 44 days until the big vote.,0
And how about Dan Blue, III, for state treasurer?,1
You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country.,0
And I really, really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!,1
Now, we are all fired up.,1
When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia.,1
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation.,0
The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.,0
This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back ...,0
You know, the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is, and of course it is.,1
Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.,0
I really believe it's the most important election of our lifetimes because we've never had a clearer choice.,1
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:,0
I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration ... and yes we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; save the 2nd amendment, and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.,0
Never.,1
It is a choice between division or unity; between strong, steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools, and hospitals.,0
It's a choice between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.,1
What I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential, of joy.,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
And we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
There is no reason, my friends, why America's best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together.,1
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America.,1
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
Hillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge.,0
Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.,1
Our core values ... our core values are being tested in this election, but my faith in our future has never been stronger.,1
I love our country and I believe in the American people.,1
And I know if we bring everyone together, we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.,1
It reads: "I'm With Her.",0
You know, one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country, as I have in this campaign, is meeting remarkable people ... people who stand up against the odds; people who, like my late mother, people who understand that everybody gets knocked down.,1
I have a different pledge: I'm With You ... the American People.,0
To all of our people, in all of our cities and towns, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.,0
What matters is whether you get back up, whether you believe you can keep going.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
Last night, in Manchester, New Hampshire, I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man, Khizr Khan, whose son, Captain Khan, was killed serving our country in Iraq.,1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
You may remember Mr. Khan's speech at the Democratic Convention.,1
And again last night, he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution.,1
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger.,1
Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state, I love the people of this state, and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November.,0
He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle.,1
Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end, and a New American Future will begin.,0
He told his men to stay back.,1
The citizens of this country will be in charge once more.,0
He moved toward the vehicle to check it out.,1
And the bomb went off.,1
He lost his life, but everyone else in his unit survived.,1
He was awarded the Bronze Star.,1
The special interests have had their day.,0
And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced, becoming a Gold Star family, was one that they thought about, grieved over in the privacy of their home, until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasn't.,1
The categories of people, starting with immigrants, including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims.,1
That chapter in our history is closing.,0
The list went on and on.,1
And it created in Mr. Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself, would his son have a place in Donald Trump's America?,1
The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.,0
Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.,1
A new chapter is beginning, and this chapter will be authored by you, the American people.,0
This will be your time.,0
Well, we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes.,1
You will be running the show.,0
Not the donors, not the insiders, not the media executives.,0
Absolutely.,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past, and anything becomes possible.,0
Change is coming.,0
All the people who've rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop.,0
Think about ... think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time.,1
Our parents, our grandparents, our great-grandparents defended democracy.,1
It's your turn now.,0
This is your time.,0
They built the great American middle class.,1
They marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers' rights, and women's rights, for LGBT rights, and the rights of people with disabilities.,1
And tomorrow we face the test of our time.,1
The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change ... not partisan change.,0
So, remember, it's not just my name or Donald Trump's name on the ballot.,1
It's the kind of country we want.,1
It's every issue anyone cares about.,1
We are fighting for all Americans ... Democrats, Republicans, Independents, Conservatives, Liberals ... who've been failed by this corrupt system.,0
So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote tomorrow.,1
We're fighting for everyone who doesn't have a voice.,0
If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, small business, then you have to vote.,1
If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty, then you have to vote.,1
We're also fighting for every region of this country.,0
If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare, paid leave, and equal pay for women, then you have to vote.,1
For every part of Florida, and every part of America.,0
And, remember, when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that I'm playing the woman's card, well, you know what I say.,1
Deal me in.,1
And if you believe, if you believe, all kids deserve good schools with good teachers, no matter what house they live in, you have to vote.,1
And if you believe college should be more affordable, you have to vote.,1
From Pensacola to Pittsburgh, from Baltimore to Baton Rouge, we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country.,0
Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125,000 and debt-free for everybody else.,1
Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past.,0
Ours is the campaign of the future.,0
And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt, we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off.,1
If you believe in science and that we've got to address climate change, you have to vote.,1
In this future, we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first ... and that keep jobs in our country.,0
All the people who got NAFTA wrong, and China wrong, and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership ... are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton.,0
If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly, then you have to vote.,1
Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.,0
And if you believe ... if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws, well, then you know, you know, North Carolina.,1
You've got to vote to get rid of HB2!,1
We've lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA.,0
China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs.,0
Now, this is so energizing, we could keep going with a long list.,1
But here's what ... here's what else I want you to know.,1
We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America.,0
A good thing this election didn't land during exams, that's all I can say.,1
The era of economic surrender is over.,0
We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and we're going to build a border wall, and Mexico will pay for it.,0
In this new future, we are going to raise your wages.,0
Household incomes are over $4,000 less today than they were in the year 2000.,0
My tax, trade, energy, immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up.,0
Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense.,0
Look.,1
Many people in this room tonight, and across this country, haven't seen a real wage increase in 18 years.,0
The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton ... much of it to her personal bank account ... to keep you from having the future you deserve.,0
Tomorrow ... tomorrow night, this election will end.,1
But on November 8th, you get to vote for the future you want.,0
In this future, we are going to pursue new education policies.,0
At the center of my plan is school choice.,0
I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family.,0
In this future, we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clinton's career.,0
But I want you to understand, our work together will be just beginning.,1
To keep our country out of war, we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength.,0
That means rebuilding our badly depleted military.,0
We have to bridge the divides in this country.,1
I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops.,0
As the Bible says, we have to repair the breaches.,1
We are going to build a 350 ship Navy, a 540,000 soldier Army, an Air Force of 1,200 combat-ready fighter jets, and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions.,0
We've got to be willing to start listening to each other again, respecting each other again.,1
Crucially, we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense.,0
We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs.,0
And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.,1
So I want you to know and I want you to spread the word.,1
I do want to be President for all Americans, not just some, not just the people who support me and vote for me.,1
I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.,1
So if you haven't voted yesterday, go to iwillvote.com.,1
You can get all the info you need.,1
And you can still sign up to volunteer.,1
Right?,1
Go to hillaryclinton.com or text 'join,' j-o-i-n, to 47246, or stop by one of our offices.,1
As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships, we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years.,0
We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more.,1
Right?,1
And years from today, when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America, an America where we build bridges, not walls, and where we prove conclusively that yes, love trumps hate!,1
Thank you!,1
Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State.,0
One more massive Hillary Clinton failure.,0
Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons.,0
Let's go vote, North Carolina!,1
Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen.,0
Her policies have produced massive global disorder.,0
God bless you!,1
Thank you all very much!,1
She handed Iraq over to ISIS, unleashing that terror group onto the world.,0
Secretary Clinton was introduced by her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, and her husband and former US President, Bill Clinton.,1
Well, my friends, just nine days left until November the 8th.,1
Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes.,1
And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted.,1
It's great to be here at the Manor Complex, a place that means so much to so many.,1
And there have been ups and downs in all that we've gone through over the years, and even in this campaign, but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you ... your lives, your futures.,1
The problems that keep you up at night.,1
That's what I'm interested in, and that's what I'm going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.,1
ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made.,0
She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood.,0
That's really what this election is about.,1
There's a lot of noise and distraction, but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who, as our president, can help us get there.,1
Fortunately, President El-Sisi is now in charge, but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country.,0
She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too ... without any plan for the day after.,0
She failed with China, which has only grown more aggressive.,0
So I want you to know ... now, I just have to say I know I'm preaching to the choir.,1
By the way, she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.,0
And of course, Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset.,0
But I also, through you, want to talk to people who are still making up their minds, believe it or not, right?,1
Because we've got a choice between a president who will bring us together, keep our country safe, get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top ... or someone who's temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.,1
She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return.,0
Then, she gave up 20% of U.S. uranium to Russia ...while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons.,0
Let's not forget, Russia went into Crimea on President Obama's watch.,0
Unlike Clinton and Obama, we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength ... not weakness.,0
And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton.,0
You know, Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse, mislead, and discourage the American people.,1
I mean, he's such a downer, right?,1
And it's time for him to stop fear mongering, stop distracting from what's really at stake, and frankly, stop disgracing our democracy.,1
We can't let him get away with this.,1
But here's the good news.,1
Yes, America is great, and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals.,1
But we are seeing Americans coming together ... Democrats, Republicans, independents ... to reject Donald Trump's dark and divisive vision of our country.,1
And it's going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days what's at stake.,1
The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin, and in all negotiations, is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States.,0
Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us.,1
We don't want a president who demeans women.,1
Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States.,0
We don't want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families.,1
Putin laughs at our leaders, and takes them to the cleaners again and again.,0
We don't want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasn't born in America.,1
That is why we will rebuild our military, strengthen our economy, and regain our position of leadership in the world ... so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again.,0
If I cannot get a good deal for the United States, I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away.,0
We don't want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality.,1
But I want you to know, the energy we're now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what we're against, it's also about what we're for.,1
That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States, ever.,0
Because we also share a common vision.,1
Beyond partisanship and politics, it's a hopeful, inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place, right?,1
They just keep losing.,0
I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States.,0
But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal.,0
And that's exactly what I'm going to be fighting for in these last nine days.,1
We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we won't get trapped in the failed approaches of the past.,0
A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children.,0
We're going to honor people, not insult them.,1
Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population.,1
African Americans, Latinos, immigrants, Muslims, POWs, women.,1
We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open, and a clear understanding of our many, many differences.,0
I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have.,0
No more apology tours.,0
And by what he has said, so many others who believe that you have a positive future.,1
I agree with that: you do.,1
And I promise you this: I'm going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.,1
Now, I will tell you, my mom taught me to never, ever quit, and what does that mean?,1
Well, that means ...",1
No more bowing to foreign powers.,0
We proudly defend America at every single turn.,0
<i>Audience Member:</i> "Rise up.",1
America will get the respect it deserves.,0
And if we don't, I will walk away from the deal like you've never seen anyone walk before.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> "You got it.,1
And, believe me, within a short while, they will come back -- but only on my terms, therefore the terms of the American people.,0
You got it.,1
On these principles, we will pursue our long-term goals of peace ... for the sake of our kids, and for the sake of the world's future.,0
Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved, and at a very high price for the world.,0
And it also means when you're knocked down, what matters is whether you get up again.,1
I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life.,1
Her policies have produced only death and destruction, not diplomacy.,0
I'm not stopping now.,1
We're just getting warmed up, right?,1
And we won't be distracted, no matter what our opponents throw at us.,1
We're not going to be knocked off course.,1
She's trigger-happy, pushing recklessly for regime change ... but never creating or promoting stability, or advancing the core interests of the United States.,0
Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal.,0
She bleached, deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress.,0
We know how much this election matters, and we know how many people are counting on us.,1
She lied to Congress while under oath, and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities.,0
By the way, who has thirteen phones in the first place?,0
So we're going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady, Michelle Obama: When they go low, we go high.,1
Only somebody with a whole lot to hide.,0
We're going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trump's strategy is real simple.,1
They've even said it in his campaign.,1
Here's his strategy about how he's going to win: Get women to stay home.,1
And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding.,0
Get young people to stay home.,1
She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.,0
Hillary Clinton isn't just part of the corrupt establishment, she is the corrupt establishment.,0
I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world.,0
Get people of color to stay home.,1
If only we'd had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening.,0
Throughout it all, Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth.,0
Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women, that murder gays, and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale.,0
Get the LGBT committee to say home.,1
My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed, including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam.,0
It's all part of his scorched earth campaign, and it goes against everything we stand for.,1
So you know how we're going to stop him?,1
By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.,1
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure.,0
We need everybody to turn out and vote ... women, young people, people of color, the LGBT community, Latinos, African Americans, Americans from all walks of life.,1
Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her.,0
It's the powerful protecting the powerful.,0
Let's break every single record.,1
Let's make that the story of this election.,1
And here's some really good news.,1
The insiders fighting for insiders.,0
This is amazing.,1
I am fighting for you.,0
All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts, and the tragedies in the Middle East.,0
I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win ... and how to avoid endless war.,0
Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform, but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country.,0
More than 20 million people have already voted in this election, most of those votes in the last few days, 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida.,1
There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people.,0
It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain.,0
Now, you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in.,1
So if all of you vote, if your friends, your family, your coworkers vote, if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes, we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.,1
That means we don't issue timetables for political reasons, but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory.,0
And I want you not only coming out for me.,1
We will pursue a new, steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States ... not a reckless, interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly.,0
I want you to reelect our members of Congress.,1
And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate.,1
And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election, listen to this.,1
We've heard some outrageous things in this campaign.,1
And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
The fact that Hillary Clinton can't even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country.,0
This is one single fact she can never escape.,0
Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission.,0
We will break the cycle of regime change, and refugee crisis, that has gone on for so many years.,0
I'm sure we'll hear more in the next nine days.,1
But I got to tell you, I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.,1
We simply can't afford to continue down the road we are on right now.,0
But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning.,1
It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York.,1
That applies to everything.,0
Now, let me say, this is important in part to remember.,1
This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS.,1
So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school, and all the kids and their families, for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine.,1
Because you know, back in the '90s, some of you remember.,1
Right?,1
Children weren't welcomed in school.,1
Change is needed at every single level of our society.,0
When I talk about making America Great Again, I'm talking about creating a future that includes each and every American.,0
And then, unannounced and uninvited, guess who barges in?,1
I want the most inclusive, generous and prosperous society we have ever had.,0
The possibilities for our future are unlimited.,0
The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small, so petty, so tired.,0
Donald Trump.,1
If we just break from this bitter, divisive past, we can achieve anything.,0
He walks right up to the stage.,1
He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation.,1
None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there.,1
That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons.,0
They want to scare you out of voting for change.,0
The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton, who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist ... now they've unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase.,0
He wasn't a donor at all.,1
It's just one more Clinton lie, one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.,0
When I talk about Making America Great Again, I'm talking about making it Great Again for Everyone ... but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind.,0
He had never given a single dollar to help build the school.,1
He just wanted people to think he had.,1
So he sat on the stage through the program, even posed for photographs, and when it was over, he got up and walked out.,1
No explanation.,1
We are the campaign of unity, and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people.,0
No donation.,1
Now really, who does that?,1
What kind of person does that?,1
Really?,1
I mean, who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good?,1
Well, I'll tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.,1
New schools, new factories, new infrastructure.,0
Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation.,0
We will develop Detroit, Not Beijing.,0
Most importantly, we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities, and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty.,0
Back in 1997, he was principal for a day at a public school.,1
Here, in Florida, we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans ... from Cuba, from Puerto Rico, from Venezuela, from Haiti, from all over.,0
That was a program we used to have in New York.,1
The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament.,1
These incredible Americans will have in Donald J. Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs, their wages, their schools, and their futures.,0
They were $5,000 short.,1
He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill.,1
At first the kids and their parents were excited.,1
Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke.,1
To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion.,0
So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine.,1
Now, this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trump's behavior, called the school, and donated the $5,000.,1
All working people, of all backgrounds and from all places, will have a true friend in Donald Trump.,0
And the coach remembers this woman saying, "I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.",1
Now, I got to say, any of you see the debates?,1
In particular, I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen, craftsmen and construction workers.,0
Well, you know, I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours, proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job.,1
I've spent my professional life among construction workers, bricklayers, electricians and plumbers.,0
I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives.,0
There's a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and not mine.,0
My campaign is powered by my own money, but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back.,0
This is our chance.,0
Right?,1
But a lot of what we've heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern.,1
And here's what the Washington Post concludes.,1
It's our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again.,0
'For as long as he has been rich and famous, he has wanted people to believe he is generous.,1
He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public, even nationally televised promises, to give his own money away.,1
It was in large part a fa..ade.',1
Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation.,0
And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other people's giving as his own.,1
Now, of course, because he's refused to release his tax returns, we don't even know if he's ever given anything.,1
But here's what we do know.,1
With Donald, it's always Donald Trump first and everyone else last.,1
Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice ... and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition.,0
He abuses his power.,1
He games the system, and he doesn't care who's left holding the bag.,1
Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world.,0
You can read the whole plan on our website, DonaldJTrump.com.,0
Massive tax reductions and tax simplification ... so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money.,0
And here's what else we know.,1
Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights.,1
Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time.,0
Most importantly, 2017 will be about unity.,0
Once again, we will be One American Nation.,0
We Will Be One American People.,0
And this election will determine whether we continue the progress we've made or let it be ripped away.,1
We know Trump has promised he'll appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obama's executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination.,1
And just this week, a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees.,1
Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences, and focus on what we have in common as Americans.,0
It's a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trump's golf courses.,1
We will be one people, living under One God, saluting one beautiful American Flag.,0
So I want you just to think.,1
We Will Make America Proud Again.,0
We Will Make America Prosperous Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
This guy works hard.,1
Friends and fellow citizens, We Will Make America Great Again!,0
The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war, kept our citizens safe at home, and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people.,0
Works with his hands.,1
Our debt to you is eternal.,0
Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.,0
Probably there 12 hours a day, maybe more, when it's the summer season.,1
After he told his coworkers he was gay, they started harassing him.,1
They called him names.,1
They even threw rocks and golf balls at him.,1
It got so bad he ended up in the hospital.,1
Now, his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing.,1
So finally he went to the police for help.,1
He was too scared even to come back to work.,1
And what did the Trump golf course do?,1
They fired him.,1
The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City.,0
Since 9/11, there have been 780,000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas ... including those with multiple deployments.,0
Right now, 10,000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other countries across the world.,0
Now, this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels.,1
For starters, it's a painful reminder of the harassment, violence, and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day.,1
Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life, work in every kind of job imaginable, and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids, serve their states, and answer the call of duty for their country.,0
And it's deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior, Trump's business punished the victim for coming forward.,1
Now, if that's how Donald Trump runs his business, what does it say about how he would run our country?,1
We've made a lot of progress on LGBT rights, but as that story reminds us, we still have work ahead, don't we?,1
There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT, or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant, and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday, post your Facebook photos on Sunday, and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love.,1
If I am given the honor to serve as your President, I will pledge to give you the resources, the equipment, and the support you need and deserve.,0
You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House.,0
So here's what I'll do as president.,1
Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.,0
We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act.,1
And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives.,1
We'll work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach.,1
I will not let you down.,0
I am running to be a President for all Americans ... and I've been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform.,0
All across this country, I've met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community.,0
And we will take on homelessness, bullying, and violence, particularly youth homelessness, which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids.,1
And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy.,1
LGBT kids don't need to be cured of anything.,1
They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected.,1
There's nothing I've enjoyed more than the time I've spent with our service members, police officers, and also our firefighters and paramedics.,0
They embody the goodness and decency of our country.,0
I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack, slander, smear and demean these wonderful, amazing people who are supporting our campaign.,0
And yes, we're going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.,1
Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life.,0
We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, the young and the old, and millions of working class families who just want a better future.,0
Now, some of you know, Chad Griffin and others know, this issue is really important to me.,1
These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized.,0
These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable, irredeemable and un-American.,0
I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State.,1
She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book ... she called them racist, sexist, xenophobic, and Islamaphobic.,0
She called them a "basket of deplorables" in both a speech and an interview.,0
I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.,1
She divides people into baskets as though they were objects, not human beings.,0
And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example.,1
I want ...,1
I want LGBT people in every corner of our country ... because don't forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today.,1
Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street.,0
Right?,1
And we're going to elevate this issue.,1
She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh.,0
They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on, paint the buildings she speaks in, and keep the lights on in her auditorium.,0
Hillary Clinton is an insider, supported by powerful insiders, attacking Americans who have no political power.,0
Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run.,0
She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules, pay their taxes, and scratch out a living for their families.,0
While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards, she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.,0
After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts.,0
She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over.,0
We're going to talk about it.,1
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through her Foundation.,0
We're going to reach out.,1
So when you vote in this election, remember, it's not just my name on the ballot.,1
It's your future.,1
It's the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq, in Syria and in Libya.,0
It's who we are as a country.,1
To this day, she still won't take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East ... or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon.,0
Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law, that she is above accountability, and that she is above each and every one of you.,0
It's every issue we care about.,1
And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake.,1
Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless.,0
It's about representing the forgotten men and women of this country.,0
I'm here to represent everyone, but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness.,0
Dignity and respect for every American is at stake.,1
The future of our economy is at stake.,1
I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless.,0
I'm running to take on the special interests, the big donors, and the corrupt political insiders.,0
I believe when the middle class thrives, Americans thrive.,1
And we're going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century, too.,1
I am running to be your voice.,0
And if we're serious about supporting a middle class, we're going to be supporting families.,1
Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street, for hedge fund managers, for the top tenth of the one percent.,0
The other day, I was in Pittsburgh.,1
And there was a woman there with her young child.,1
We've got some folks from Pittsburgh.,1
She was shaking Tim Kaine's hand.,1
Just look at the people funding Hillary Clinton's campaign, and paying for her speeches, and you'll know who she represents.,0
And she said to him, "I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago.,1
And the next day, I was fired.,1
The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service.,0
It had been a difficult pregnancy.,1
I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover, and the answer was 'No.,1
Don't come back at all.',1
Nobody, no parent, should ever have to make that kind of choice, but that's also true when we talk about paid family leave, caring for a spouse or a partner, caring for an elderly relative.,1
You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter.,0
I want us to recognize the way we live today.,1
It is no longer the 1950s.,1
You can't lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.,0
We need to support people who are part of committed relationships, of families, of marriages, and give everybody the support you need to actually do what's the most important thing in life.,1
And that is caring for each other.,1
Hillary Clinton still hasn't apologized to those she slandered.,0
In fact, she hasn't backed down at all ... she's doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt.,0
We're going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare, paid family leave, earned sick days, jobs with rising incomes.,1
If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, then I don't see how she can credibly campaign.,0
Let's be clear.,0
These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton.,0
We're going to raise the national minimum wage.,1
These were not stray remarks in an interview, or an accidental choice of words.,0
These were lengthy, planned, and prepared remarks ... it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee.,0
No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.,1
Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook ... smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change.,0
She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people.,0
And yes, we're going to guarantee equal pay for women's work.,1
We're going to make sure.,1
She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform.,0
We're going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer.,1
People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists.,0
And I've got to tell you that's such a stark contrast with Trump.,1
He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy ... that's with trillions of dollars going to the top ... that will somehow trickle down.,1
They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.,0
People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes.,0
They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.,0
People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced.,0
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.,0
Hillary Clinton doesn't have to worry about Sanctuary Cities, or jobs moving overseas.,0
It hasn't worked.,1
She's protected from her own policies.,0
It won't work.,1
I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up.,1
The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools, shrinking incomes, and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.,0
Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans.,0
And that's exactly what we're going to do.,1
We are the campaign of school choice.,0
We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker.,0
We are the campaign that will deliver a government of, by and for the people.,0
This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy.,0
So, my friends, we've got a guy who won't pay his income tax.,1
We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us.,0
I mean, I've got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didn't pay income tax for like 20 years, he said that was smart.,1
We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do ... and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS.,0
And I thought to myself, how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars?,1
I mean, really.,1
Instead of endless wars, we want a real plan for victory.,0
We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent, and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States.,0
My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military, and the elimination of the defense sequester.,0
And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos?,1
But it's serious because it means he's paid zero, zero for our military, our vets, for healthcare, for Pell Grants, for our universities, our colleges, our highways.,1
This is Trump to a T.,1
The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like he's done something, well, he shows up and criticizes our country.,1
He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments.,1
He chose to make his products in other countries, not America.,1
In this rebuilding, we will provide our National Guard with the best, modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world.,0
He's built a career on stiffing small businesses.,1
I take that personally.,1
My dad was a small business owner.,1
The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people.,0
You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike.,0
You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest.,0
You are there to respond to every natural disaster.,0
I'm sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.,1
You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution, and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done.,0
So, my friends, we've got work to do.,1
And let's get to that work.,1
In a Trump Administration, the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office.,0
We've got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote.,1
You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day.,0
You will have a President who supports, promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn.,0
I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future, you voted for a better America.,1
The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom, our safety and our country.,0
We will never forget our heroes, their families, and the ones they've left behind.,0
And look how easy it is.,1
It is so easy.,1
Our gratitude is everlasting.,0
Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now.,1
And if you are registered in Broward County, you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. all week.,1
We will protect those who protect us.,0
And we will follow your example of unity ... working in common purpose and common cause.,0
We will be one people, under one God, saluting one American flag.,0
And if you have been mailed your ballot, make sure you fill it out and mail it back today.,1
You can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place.,1
We will rebuild our military ... and our country.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And We Will Make America Great Again.,0
And make sure you have a plan to vote.,1
Thank you, and God Bless you all.,0
Together, we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House, and Make America Great Again.,0
But, please, also help us in these last nine days.,1
The White House will become the People's House.,0
We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years.,0
Every phone call you make, every door you knock on will make a difference.,1
So go to hillaryclinton.com.,1
We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure, renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, free children from failing government schools, eliminate government waste, and create a fair, simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs.,0
Prosperity will rise, poverty will recede, and wages will finally begin to grow ... and they will grow rapidly.,0
This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people.,0

I don't want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed.,1
In recent days, we've rolled out one new policy idea after another ... on taxes, on school choice, on foreign policy, on defeating terrorism, on rebuilding our military, on Veterans care, on unleashing American energy, and on the vital issue of trade.,0
I'm against depression.,1
We don't want that to happen in this election.,1
By contrast, Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign.,0
Right?",1
She offers no ideas, no solutions, only hatred and derision.,0
I am running to be a President for all Americans ... Democrat, Republican, Independent, everyone.,0
Whether you vote for me, or whether you vote for someone else, I will be your greatest champion.,0
Our support comes from every part of America, and every walk of life.,0
<i>Audience:</i> "No!",1
<i>Clinton:</i> "I don't want people to be sad because they didn't do their part.,1
We have the support of cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, the young and the old, and millions of working class families all over this nation.,0
We can't let that happen.,1
And I have to ask you if you ... if you know anybody, if you know anybody, who is thinking about voting for Trump, you've got to stage an intervention.,1
Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because, after all, friends don't let friends vote for Trump.,1
Right?,1
So I am so grateful to all of you.,1
Have many of you have already voted?,1
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people.,0
Okay.,1
So, now, how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote?,1
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.,0
It's this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear ... including with a hammer ... so the FBI couldn't see them, and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena.,0
That's what's going to make the difference.,1
Change is coming.,1
Let's make sure it's the right kind of change.,1
The choice is yours.,1
Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today.,0
We're going to do everything we can to build a stronger, better, fairer America, coming together, healing the divides among us.,1
Anyone watching today's hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clinton's actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined.,0
This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was, but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs ... here we don't have either.,0
And we're going to prove, once and for all, that love trumps Hate.,1
This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation.,0
Whether it's her emails, her disasters in Iraq, Libya and Syria, or her failures on the economy, Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement, temperament and moral character to lead this country.,0
Thank you.,1
Secretary Clinton was introduced by Ken Evans who is a Broward County Democratic State Committeeman.,1
The Manor Complex, where this event was held, is a gay friendly club/lounge.,1
Thank you, thank you.,1
Wow!,1
In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: "she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office...from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true.",0
It's great to be here at this extraordinary time in our country's history at this great university to have a chance on a beautiful day to lift our sights, to think about what we are capable of doing together.,1
The kind of future that we can create if we search for and find common ground.,1
The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas, and produced only failing schools, rising crime, job loss, shrinking incomes, and tragic poverty at home.,0
And it is thrilling to have traveled across our country to see the hopefulness, to talk about the positive changes that are occurring. ,1
1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.,0
Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009.,0
To really see America at its best, and tomorrow, each and every one of you gets to make a decision as to whether or not, first, you will vote.,1
Because in Pennsylvania, it's all about Election Day.,1
And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years.,0
I am running to reverse these policies, and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans.,0
Other places around the country have been voting for weeks.,1
That includes our family farms right here in Iowa.,0
Family farms are the backbone of this country.,0
And what you will vote for. ,1
We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms.,0
I'm here to ask you to vote for yourselves, vote for your families, vote for your futures, vote on the issues that matter to you because they are on the ballot, not just my name and my opponent's name.,1
We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, corn-based ethanol, eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S. rule, and provide desperately-needed tax relief.,0
I want to thank Tom Colicchio for coming out here.,1
He's in the middle of opening another one of his great restaurants, but he said he's got these two small kids and he just had to come and be part of lifting up this election and creating the kind of commitment that will bring a record breaking number of Americans to vote.,1
Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent, and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death ... helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish.,0
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers, help them export their goods, and grow family farming in America.,0
We are on the path to seeing more Americans coming out to vote than we have ever seen in our history. ,1
My first day in office, I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.,0
And I am hoping that you won't just come out to vote, obviously, I hope you vote for me, but I also hope you will send Katie McGinty to the United States Senate.,1
We've got some great elected officials here, and I want to recognize Congressman Mike Doyle, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, from Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, from Braddock, PA, Mayor John Fetterman. ,1
But mostly, I'm here to say thanks.,1
Thanks for taking time out to think about what's -- what the stakes are.,1
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.,0
I love you all, too.,1
Absolutely!,1
So for those who are still making up your minds or thinking, 'Maybe, maybe it's not worth voting at all,' let me just say: the choice in this election could not be clearer.,1
It really is between division or unity.,1
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.,0
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy ... which means lower electricity prices for our farmers, and half a million new jobs a year.,0
That's just the beginning.,0
Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare ... this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.,0
By the way, remember when Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, said the "lack of transparency," was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about ... and I quote ... "the stupidity of the American voter.",0
Between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon.,1
Between an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and an economy that is set up and run for those at the top. ,1
Now, I have spent my public career fighting for kids and families, and standing up for our country, and if you give me the privilege of your vote tomorrow, that is what I will do every single day of my presidency.,1
I will get up in the White House, and I will think about what I can do that day to knock down barriers, to create opportunities, so that you have the chance to fulfill your own dreams.,1
You see, I believe America's best days are still ahead of us.,1
This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr. Gruber and Hillary Clinton ... and the voters have had enough.,0
They're taking their country back.,0
Another major reform is going to be school choice.,0
Now, that doesn't mean we don't have to work for it because we do.,1
I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.,0
That doesn't mean that we can just expect it to happens as kind of a birthright, but I really believe that.,1
This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.,0
It's time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.,0
I would not have worked for 18 months, travelled across our country, thought as hard as I have about what we need to do and how to do it together, proudly stand up and defend the legacy of President Obama, which has given our country progress in the right direction if I did not believe with all my heart that we could do this. ,1
Right?,1
We can do this!,1
We don't have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America.,1
Our policies on taxes, trade, regulations and education will grow incomes, boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities.,0
We need a new civil rights agenda for our time, one that promises safe neighborhoods, great education, and secure jobs.,0
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty, including 45% of African-American children under the age of six.,0
Tomorrow, you can vote for a hopeful, inclusive, big-hearted America.,1
And our core values are being tested in this election.,1
And I know that people are frustrated, a lot of people feel left out and left behind.,1
There's fear, even anger, in our country.,1
58% of African-American youth are not working.,0
But I've got to say: anger is not a plan, my friends.,1
Violent crime rose in America's fifty largest cities last year.,0
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington, D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.,0
If we're going to harness our energy and try to overcome our problems, then we've got to start talking to each other again, and we have to get good ideas wherever they come from. ,1
Over 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year.,0
Last night in Manchester, New Hampshire, I was with Khizr Khan, whose son was killed while serving in Iraq.,1
There's a shooting on average every 2 hours.,0
You might remember him from the Democratic Convention.,1
He was not a man to be on the stage of a political convention, but when he heard my opponent say what he said about Muslims and he looked at the flag that had been draped on his son's coffin, he felt compelled to speak out.,1
To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose ... vote for Donald J. Trump.,0
I will fix it.,0
He spoke powerfully about what America means to him and how we have to defend our values and our Constitution. ,1
As he said last night, his son serving in the United States Army with his unit saw something suspicious, moved toward it to check it out telling his men to stay behind, and when the car exploded, he lost his life.,1
I will bring back millions of jobs, higher wages, and great schools.,0
I will make your communities safe.,0
He was awarded Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, but as Mr. Khan said, "When you listen to all the people that my opponent has insulted and denigrated, would there be a place in Donald Trump's America for Captain Khan?",1
The Khan family gives me hope because they truly believe in the values of this great country of ours, and they have stood up holding the Constitution as he did at the convention to say, "People around the world cherish this Constitution, believe in our values.,1
It's a source of hope for billions of people.,1
We will never, ever let that go, and we never let someone rip it away in the kind of negative, divisive, hateful campaign that we have seen from the other side in this election.",1
Sometimes when I hear my opponent speak, I don't recognize the country he's talking about.,1
That doesn't mean we don't have problems and challenges, it doesn't mean that we don't have to do more to help people across our country get better economic opportunities.,1
Of course, we do.,1
Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse.,0
The victims were dragged, then hung from meathooks, and then their throats were slit.,0
This is an evil, sadistic, monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country.,0
We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows, and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country.,0
My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees.,0
According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration, her entire plan will bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits.,0
But boy, I believe we can do it.,1
Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world, we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs.,0
I support the construction of safe zones in the region, and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it.,0
I love our country.,1
At the same time, as we rebuild our military, we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share.,0
I believe in the American people.,1
Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense.,0
I know what we are capable of.,1
I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden ... and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism.,0
In all things, it's time to put Americans first ... and start taking care of each other.,0
Throughout of history, generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time.,1
Tonight, I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.,0
On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.,0
They defended democracy, built the greatest middle class that the world has ever seen, marched for civil rights and voting rights, for workers rights and women's rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities. ,1
I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment.,0
I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to, so importantly, renegotiate your horrible trade deals, especially NAFTA ... which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States ... and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.,0
Tomorrow, we face the test of our time, will we be coming together as a nation or getting further apart?,1
And Apple, and our other major companies, will start making their iPhones, computers and other products inside of the United States ... not in China, and all over the world.,0
We don't make our products anymore in the United States, but we will again ... like never before.,0
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
Will we set goals that all of us can help meet?,1
Or will we turn on each other and pit one group of Americans against another? ,1
Now, our names will be on the ballot tomorrow, but those values and every issue you care about will be there, too.,1
What kind of country do we want, and I particularly think about this for young people as I look at this crowd and see so many students and young Americans that deserve the same opportunities that many of us were given.,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.,0
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
We will make sure they are available because if you think about what it takes to have a thriving America, it comes down to a couple of key issues. ,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Prosperous Again.,0
We Will Make America Safe Again.,0
And Will Make America Great Again.,0
If you believe that America thrives when the middle class thrives, then you have to vote.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows.,0
Your stories are not featured in the news, you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf, you have no special interests taking up your cause, and politicians ignore your cries for help.,0
We're going to make the biggest investment in good-paying jobs since World War II, jobs in infrastructure, small business, clean energy, advanced manufacturing.,1
We're going to actually deliver on that unlike my opponent, who makes his products mostly overseas, buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of what's made by American steelworkers right here in Pennsylvania.,1
We're going to invest in America, and we're especially going to invest in communities that are left out and left behind.,1
But I never will.,0
We're going to stand up for the right of workers to organize and bargain.,1
We're going to get incomes rising across America. ,1
And if you believe we need a fairer economy as I do, then we're going to raise the national minimum wage, because no one who works full time in America should still be in poverty.,1
I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign.,0
And we're going to do more to support working families with affordable child care, paid leave, and finally, equal pay for women's work. ,1
But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I've spent with the families of the Remembrance Project, and the incredible strength and courage you've shown in your often lonely fight for justice.,0
I've got to tell you, this always get's about the biggest applause ever because fundamentally, we know it's not fair, but it's also about families.,1
You are heroes.,0
And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers, sisters, sons, daughters or parents.,0
If you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter who's working, you don't want her shortchanged, do you?,1
Now, when I talk about equal pay and all of these other family issues, my opponent says I'm playing the woman's card.,1
Well, you know what I say: deal me in. ,1
The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives.,0
Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office.,0
If you believe all our kids should have good schools and good teachers, no matter what zip code they live in, then you have to vote.,1
If you believe we can make college affordable for every young American, then you have got to vote. ,1
I've got to say, I was very proud of the primary campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran.,1
Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized.,0
Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place, innocent Americans are put in harm's way.,0
Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child.,0
It was a campaign on issues and ideas, not insults.,1
And after it was over, he and I got together, and we came up with this plan.,1
Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than $125,000 a year.,1
It's happening every single day.,0
And it should be debt free for everybody else.,1
I don't think you should go into this massive debt to get your education.,1
It's good for you, it's good for your families, it's good for our country, and we're going to make it affordable for everyone.,1
And for the millions of Americans already struggling with student debt, we're going to ease that burden.,1
We're going to get those interest rates down, we're going to give you a different way of repaying it as a percentage of your income, not tied to a six, eight, 10 percent interest rate, and you're never going to have to pay more than you can afford. ,1
You see, I think there are a lot of positive things to get excited about.,1
And I think the agenda we've put forth in this campaign is one that will really give everybody hope.,1
All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table, because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws.,0
You see, working for children and families has been the cause of my life, but it's never been more important than it is right now. ,1
So this has to be our mission together ... doing all we can to help every American, especially every young American and especially every child, to have the chance to live up to your God-given potential.,1
There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate.,0
But let me give you the most important number of all.,0
That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration.,0
Because when it's all said and done, that's what matters the most.,1
Have you helped somebody else?,1
Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO.,0
Have you reached out and tried to ease somebody's burden?,1
Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws.,0
We do it individually. ,1
What do you tell to the mother, who just buried her daughter, because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?,0
My mother got through a neglected, abandoned childhood because people showed her kindness.,1
Her own parents didn't want her.,1
What do you tell to the young boy, who will grow up without a dad, because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country?,0
Her own grandparents didn't want her.,1
What do you tell the wife, who has lost her husband, because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars?,0
But that first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat, brought extra food every single day to make sure my mother had something to eat.,1
And when she was 14 and had to go out and find a job to support herself and got a job as a maid and a babysitter in somebody's home, she was just relieved that she had somewhere to live and that she could support herself.,1
This must end.,0
And it must end right now.,0
But the mother of that home understood my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said, 'Dorothy, if you get up early and get your chores done, you can go to high school.,1
Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.,0
You'll have to come right back because I'll need you, but you can do it.',1
And look, that sounds harsh to our ears, telling a 14 year old, 'Okay, you can go to high school but you have to come right back and you have to work on both sides of it.',1
But to my mother, it was a blessing.,1
So when I think about what so many people have gone through to give us the opportunities that we had had, and I'm speaking for myself, my mother gave me the resilience, the grit, the get up and go.,1
Just look at what's happened in the last few days.,0
She told me, 'Everyone gets knocked down.,1
Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period.,0
What matters is if you get back up.',1
And we had a lot of Americans knocked down because of the Great Recession, didn't we?,1
Millions of jobs were lost, millions of homes were lost.,1
Earlier this week, in Kansas, a Sheriff's Department Master Deputy was killed, apparently by an illegal immigrant.,0
The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013.,0
Family wealth was wiped out, savings account, 401K's, everything that people had worked so hard for. ,1
Well we've dug ourselves out of the hole and now we need to get up, and we've got to make sure we don't leave anybody behind.,1
I see this man here standing with a sign: 'Coal Miners for Hillary,' and I'll tell you sir, I know how hard times are.,1
Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughter's fourth birthday.,0
And as I have said, and you can take it to the bank, I will not forget you and I will do everything I can to help people who have given so much, worked so hard throughout their lives for generations to build this country.,1
We are not going to forget any American!,1
A few days ago, two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa.,0
But I can't do any of this without your help tomorrow. ,1
This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported ... but his home country refused to take him back, so he was simply released.,0
This election is going to really set the course of our country.,1
One of the victims has six children, is an Air Force Veteran, and a high school football coach ... the other victim is a mother and a grandmother.,0
When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clinton's desk.,0
But she failed to take forceful action, and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that don't take back their citizens.,0
According to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back.,0
Most of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch ... she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it.,0
Now, my opponent will never meet with you.,0
She will never hear your stories.,0
She will never share in your pain.,0
There's no doubt in my mind.,1
Tonight, I'll be in Philadelphia with President Obama and Michelle and I so appreciate how hard they worked for me, but it's not for me.,1
She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates.,0
Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days, which means Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants.,0
It's for us. ,1
When President Obama came into office, put yourself in his shoes -- this young, dynamic, first African-American elected to become President of the United States.,1
And what does he find?,1
Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border.,0
He finds the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that's what he finds. ,1
Wow, those were hard, hard times.,1
I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for making sure we didn't go even deeper in the ditch we were in.,1
Sanctuary Cities.,0
Ignoring visa overstays.,0
But make no mistake: there were reasons we ended up in that ditch.,1
It didn't happen by accident.,1
We had huge tax cuts on the wealthy, the administration in office took their eyes off the financial markets and we know what happened.,1
Closing detention centers.,0
They ignored the pressures in the mortgage markets and we know what happened. ,1
Elections have consequences for everything we care about.,1
And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America.,0
Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order ... violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril.,0
Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country.,0
And that's why we've got to each and every one of you put down your stake in our future.,1
But the media doesn't want you to know any of that.,0
If the lines are long tomorrow, please wait.,1
So they'll never ask her any questions about her plan.,0
Like how she'll afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants, or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody ... or at the border.,0
She's not asked to explain what she'll say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law.,0
Your cause, and your stories, are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost.,0
To them, your presence is just too inconvenient.,0
In early voting, we have had people waiting in line for two and three hours and there have been reporters and others going up and down the line, asking them, all types of Americans, not one type -- all types, 'Why are you here?',1
But help is coming.,0
'Because my future depends on it,' they say. ,1
So tomorrow is the election, but that is just beginning.,1
We have to heal this country.,1
We have to bring people together, listen and respect each other.,1
On November 8th, we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim.,0
Now I know it's unusual for somebody running for president to say this, I started saying this months ago, because I was literally meeting who were scared about what they were hearing in this election.,1
I've known a lot of the Republicans who've run for president been elected president in recent history, I didn't agree with them on everything, obviously we had our differences, but I didn't doubt that they were fit to serve as president.,1
This election is different.,1
This person is temperamentally unqualified, experientially unqualified to be president and so many people know that. ,1
Together, we will save American lives ... and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today.,0
So I think we do need more love and kindness, right?,1
We have to got to rise above all of this hate filled rhetoric, all of these insults and scapegoating and finger pointing and insulting.,1
I want to be a president for all Americans.,1
Not just some.,1
I want to be the president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents.,1
I want to be the president for those who vote for and those who vote against me.,1
I want to represent everybody.,1
Because I know we have a role to play in building a better future. ,1
So it starts tomorrow.,1
Since 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities ... these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation.,0
According to the federal government's own data, there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now.,0
If you don't know where to vote, go to IWillVote.com.,1
You can get all the information you need, the polls will be open from 7 AM to 8 PM.,1
We are on track, as I said, to have a huge turnout.,1
However, this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice, fled the jurisdiction, or were otherwise never caught.,0
But we can only do that if all of you make up your minds, you bring all your friends, everybody you know, to make sure your voices are heard. ,1
This is a historic, historic election and we're going to do everything we can, not only to win, but then immediately to get to work.,1
And I especially invite anyone who wants to volunteer for the next 24 hours, go to hillaryclinton.com, text join, J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6, stop by one of our offices.,1
We would love to see you.,1
Because when your kids and grandkids ask what you in the future what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, you'll be able to say: you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America where we build bridges, not walls.,1
Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases.,0
And where we finally prove once and for all that, yes, love trumps hate.,1
At the same time, hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism.,0
We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe.,0
Thank you.,1
And thank you.,1
I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who, as you can tell, just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.,1
Whether it's drugs, terrorism or violent crime, our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country.,0
It took a lot of courage to come here, Mae.,1
The Border Patrol Agents, who endorsed me, warned that Hillary Clinton's plan would put the entire country in grave danger ... they called it radical, deeply dangerous, and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis.,0
Let's just remember our goal ... to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate.,0
Thank you.,1
That is what is at stake in this election.,0
So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak.,0
[INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK],0
Thank you for being with us.,1
These wounded American families have been alone.,0
But they are alone no longer.,0
I also want to thank a long-time friend of mine, a great activist, extraordinary advocate in Congress, and that's U.S. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton.,1
I am here standing with you.,0
I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here.,1
The American people are here standing with you.,0
And either you're all related to him or you think he's doing a good job.,1
And come November, your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive.,0
Well, I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him.,1
And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people.,1
New polls have just come in, and we're leading in battleground states all over this country ... including four points here in Florida.,0
He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.,1
I also want to acknowledge Josh Stein, candidate for North Carolina attorney general.,1
Patsy Keever, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party.,1
And State Senator Don Davis.,1
And I saved the best for last, someone who I've gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with.,1
First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is "I have to talk to you about our farmers.",1
Very first thing he said.,1
LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide.,0
Come November 8th, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House.,0
Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today.,1
We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding.,1
And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected.,1
It's going to be a victory for the people ... it's going to be a victory for the workers, the families, the Veterans, the everyday citizens.,0
And it's going to be a victory for those who haven't had reason for hope in a long time.,0
I'm campaigning in every community, and every part of this country, for every last vote.,0
We've got to be really focused on what we're going to do with this extreme weather.,1
I am running to be a President for all Americans.,0
We're getting more of it in more places.,1
I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and I'm going to be campaigning hard for their votes.,0
And I'm going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared.,1
They're resilient.,1
But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.,1
What incredible people.,0
Our support comes from all regions, all backgrounds and all walks of life.,0
You are cops and soldiers, carpenters and welders, accountants and lawyers, young and old, rich and poor, black, white and Hispanic ... but above all else, you are American.,0
Just today, I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders.,0
And nobody knows more about weather than our farmers.,1
And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes, but particularly small farms.,1
We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals.,0
You know, I think you said the farm you went to this morning, G.K., was 200 acres.,1
You know, that's a lot of land, but that's not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm.,1
And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big, giant farms, and not enough taking care of the smaller farms, the family-owned farms, farms that have been in people's families for generations.,1
And I will do my very best working with G.K. and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it.,1
And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it.,1
We also have the support of 16,500 Border Patrol Officers ... as well as law enforcement officers across the country.,0
And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run.,0
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country.,0
Clinton's campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists.,0
It's the oldest play in the Democratic play book ... and Americans have had enough.,0
They want solutions, and they want better lives ... not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians.,0
People who want their immigration laws enforced, and their borders secured, are not racists.,0
There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind.,1
They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected.,0
And so we've got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.,1
People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes.,0
They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe.,0
People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced.,0
That is my goal as your president.,1
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence.,0
I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead.,1
Now also, on a personal note, I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there.,1
Yet, while she lives behind gates and walls and guards, and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors, she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians.,0
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State, hide and delete her emails, destroy her phones with a hammer, put classified information in the reach of our enemies, lie to Congress, and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation.,0
It's the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Iran and all over the world.,0
I don't know -- 15,000, 16,000 people.,1
It was just extraordinary.,1
It's the same reason why she won't take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS.,0
But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.,1
Her policies have created disaster overseas, and poverty at home.,0
I am running to reverse these failures, and create a New American future.,0
That future begins with prosperity at home.,0
And, you know, I've been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field.,1
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs, jobs, jobs.,0
One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities.,0
And, you know, it's been a long time, 108 years, to win a championship and make history.,1
And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub, could have seen it happen.,1
So last night was very special on lots of fronts.,1
African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership.,0
And who knows?,1
Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century.,0
Maybe we'll see even more history made in a few days.,1
You know, the last time the Cubs won, women couldn't vote.,1
They control the mayors' offices, the school boards, the city councils, and the seats in Congress ... and all they have delivered is more poverty, more crime, and more failing schools.,0
And I think women are making up for that in this election.,1
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty.,0
More than 3,000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone.,0
58% of African-American youth are not working.,0
So thank you.,1
Thank you so much for being here.,1
These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, and everyone knows that if she's elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering.,0
Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years ... her disastrous record speaks for itself.,0
The only people she delivers for is her donors.,0
Are you ready to vote?,1
How many -- how many folks have already voted?,1
[<i>applause</i>],1
Well, that's really impressive.,1
Are you ready to volunteer these last few days?,1
Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor?,1
Have a governor who puts families first and your needs.,1
I am going to deliver for you, the American people.,0
If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.,0
I know he'll do a terrific job. ,1
Are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate?,1
She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve.,1
My first day in office, I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years.,0
All needless, job-killing regulations will be cancelled.,0
And unlike her opponent, she's never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.,1
And then, are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?,1
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in.,0
You know, did any of you -- any of you see those debates?,1
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy ... which means at least another half a million new jobs a year.,0
Well, you know, I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.,1
That's just the beginning.,0
Also on my first day, I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare ... this will instantly save another 2 million jobs.,0
I am also going to completely reform our trade deals.,0
But, you know, he kept saying things like, "Well, you know, what have you done for 30 years?",1
Well, we know what he's done for 30 years, starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.,1
I chose a different path.,1
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and keep America out of the TPP.,0
I have spent my career fighting for kids and families.,1
We don't need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down.,0
Another major reform is going to be school choice.,0
I've outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private, public, magnet or religious school of his or her choice.,0
This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty.,0
Since President Obama came into office, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty.,0
And I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program as first lady.,1
This is unacceptable.,0
That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year.,1
To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs, we are going to build up your schools, and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children.,0
Earlier this week, I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable, quality childcare for their children.,0
And I have to tell you, I know it doesn't make headlines.,1
It's not going to, you know, get a big Twitter war going, but when I travel around and shake hands like I'll do after my remarks, and somebody says to me, "The Children's Health Insurance Program saved my son's life.",1
On policy after policy, we are going to provide opportunity, prosperity and security for all Americans.,0
We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression.,0
The President's one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime.,0
But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order, which means the next President can reverse them ... and that is what I will do, unless the Castro Regime meets our demands.,0
I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf.,1
And the doctor said, "You know, she's never, ever going to be able to talk; she's not ever going to be able to hear.",1
Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people.,0
Let's also talk about Venezuela.,0
Her mother, who is determined, began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments.,1
Venezuela is a beautiful, vibrant, and resource-rich country, filled with amazing and hardworking people.,0
But they were expensive.,1
But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists.,0
She didn't know what she was going to do.,1
The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere, and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free.,0
And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said "I just heard about this new program, the children's health insurance program.,1
Maybe you can qualify for that.",1
Because it's really for families that aren't poor, but don't have much money, and a lot of families isn't it.,1
And families that don't have an employer that provides health insurance, self employed, independent contractors.,1
So, the mom found out about this thing call the children's health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter.,1
I met that young woman, and she said hello to me and she talked to me.,1
Here, in America, I will push to expand freedom for all of our people.,0
I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA ... and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first.,0
She just graduated from college, right here in North Carolina.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
So don't let anybody tell you, it doesn't matter what you stand for, what you fight for, and who you are trying to help.,1
When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.,1
As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it.,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, mined from American sources, will power this nation.,0
And many of them...,1
<i>Audience:</i> [<i>inaudible</i>],1
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Where you there?,1
God bless you.,1
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation ... and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People.,0
That's another thing, I meet people all over who were there, and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there.,1
And as your Secretary of State, I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's right and LGBT rights around the world.,1
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.,0
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.,0
And everything I've done, it's because I've been listening to people and again I know that's not very exciting.,1
I plead to that.,1
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
You spend time listening not talking, you know, what are the poor journalists going to say, "Uh, there Hillary Clinton was listening again," right?,1
Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.,0
We Will Make America Prosperous Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
And Will Make America Great Again.,0
But I'll tell you it is what motivates me to hear people's stories, to hear the tribulations and triumphs.,1
You get good ideas.,1
Bring people together; find common ground, even with people we disagree with.,1
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
I disagree with people on lots of issues, but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other, and try to find common that common ground.,1
And that will enable us to get results for people.,1
Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival ... it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.,0
And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President I'll be.,1
And from the first day of this campaign, I've been telling you what I want to do.,1
My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.,0
Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you.,1
I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for, not just someone to vote against.,1
Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy.,0
And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear.,1
The positives and the negatives, because one way or the other, come this January, America is going to have a new President.,1
It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.,0
And it will be either me or Donald Trump.,1
Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited.,0
The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed.,0
And you know what else?,1
People say all the time, you know I want change, will come, that is certain.,1
In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM ... today it is less than 8,000.,0
The question is what kind of change are we going to have.,1
Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.,0
Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together?,1
It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico.,0
Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.,0
We are going to turn this around.,0
So, here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe haven't yet voted, maybe haven't yet made up their mind.,1
My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.,0
I want you to ask them, imagine it is January 20th, 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.,1
We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.,0
Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office, making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures.,1
Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success.,0
Imagine having a president who demeans women, mocks the disabled, insults African Americans and Latinos.,1
Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in.,0
Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together.,1
Failing schools can become flourishing schools.,0
Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure.,0
Someone who always puts himself first and doesn't care who gets hurt along the way,1
Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment.,0
And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.,0
A president with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him.,1
All of these things, and so much more, are possible.,0
But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism ... which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country ... and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.,0
Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?,0
Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope.,1
The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen.,1
If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.,0
You know as Michelle Obama says, the presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are.,1
And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump.,1
America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries.,0
Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.,0
My opponent's plan rejects this optimism.,0
If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous.,1
Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war.,1
She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution ... a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.,0
The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests.,0
And yet this morning in Florida, Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote "I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had".,1
Now -- he knows we can see and hear him, right?,1
This is someone who at another rally, yesterday, actually said out loud to himself, stay on point Donald, Stay on point.,1
In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.,0
Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers.,0
His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters, stay on point Donald, stay on point.,1
You know, we have seen it over and over again.,1
We know his true self.,1
The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check.,0
His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head, no matter how wrong he is.,1
He can't help himself.,1
Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed.,0
In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people.,0
So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?,1
Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated, his disrespect throughout this campaign.,1
In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom.,1
Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.,0
In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end.,0
Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country.,1
I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.,0
Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there.,0
Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans.,0
My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable ... how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?,0
The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos ... but above everything else, they are all American.,0
They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future.,0
Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair.,1
He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field.,1
These are the forgotten men and women of America.,0
Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins.,1
And Mae wasn't alone.,1
Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment, their application was marked with a "C" -- "C" for colored.,1
In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s.,1
They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color.,1
Think about that.,1
People who work hard but don't have a voice.,0
If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department.,1
If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans?,1
I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country.,0
And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the "Central Park Five.",1
Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.,0
These were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14. Who, it turns out, were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.,1
I'm not running to be President of the world.,0
I'm running to be President of the United States ... and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.,0
We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.,0
It's time to start thinking big once again.,0
That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth.,0
In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal.,0
Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids.,1
Nearly three decades later, they were exonerated by DNA evidence.,1
Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs.,0
Also, someone else confessed to the crime.,1
You can visit our website to see the math.,0
So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison.,1
To him, those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says.,1
This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings.,0
Do we want this man appointing judges?,1
It will be deficit neutral.,0
If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.,0
It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.,0
Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?,1
Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter ... that translates to millions of lost jobs.,0
<i>Audience:</i> No!,1
This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.,0
Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years.,0
Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.,0
Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work.,0
<i>Clinton:</i> Well, people who are voting for him, that's what they would get.,1
Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.,0
He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.,1
On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt.,0
He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories.,1
It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt ... it took President Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion.,0
And you better believe he's being heard loudly and clearly.,1
Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party.,1
Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.,1
Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.,0
They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign, "Make America Great Again.",1
They said it's about preserving white identity.,1
Instead, the opposite happened.,0
And they placed their faith and hope in him.,1
You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America?,1
It's not just about communities of color.,1
We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.,0
It's about young people.,1
It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated.,1
That is not who America is and we're not going to let it ever go back to that.,1
Never has so much money been spent so poorly.,0
But we're going to turn that all around.,0
Here's how.,0
But it doesn't end there.,1
It begins with bold new tax reform.,0
As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3.,0
You've also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either?,1
Imagine our daughters, or in my case now my granddaughter, growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent.,1
Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth.,1
The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all ... in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.,0
And how that will affect our young men and boys, who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.,1
So, this is a pretty clear choice, North Carolina.,1
I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is.,1
By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.,0
In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer.,0
They will receive the biggest benefit ... it won't even be close.,0
Now we have to decide who we are.,1
This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal.,0
The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka.,0
Right?,1
These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.,0
And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying.,1
Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents.,0
We know that America is big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families.,0
The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.,0
We want to lift people up, not tear people down.,1
Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives.,0
We are called -- we are called.,1
Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit ... in the form a Childcare rebate ... and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.,0
A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.,0
A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.,0
By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.,0
One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate ... down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent.,0
In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we?,1
An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created.,0
We are not asked, we are not requested, we are not urged -- we are commanded.,1
And we know how hard that is.,1
It will be amazing to watch.,0
We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.,0
When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging.,1
Love your neighbor as yourself?,1
On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate.,0
Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion.,0
By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.,0
Well, first, you've got to love yourself.,1
We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs ... and that means jobs in our poorest communities.,0
Next, comes regulations.,0
You've got to respect yourself.,1
And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself.,1
I believe with all my heart that we are better than this.,1
And that's why I want to paint a different picture.,1
Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election.,1
We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.,1
We are not going to accept the status quo.,1
What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal.,1
People painted "vote Trump" on the side.,1
And then they set it on fire.,1
One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.,0
Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry ... and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.,0
In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year.,0
Who would do that to a house of worship?,1
In America, that can never be acceptable.,1
What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies, toddlers, children drinking water that was poisoning them.,1
And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence.,1
You know their names: Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Sander Bland, Key Scott.,1
Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.,0
So many.,1
I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books.,0
We can't accept that as normal either.,1
This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule.,0
It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year.,0
So we are going to get to work.,1
I'm just telling you.,1
If I'm fortunate enough to be your president, we're going to roll up our sleeves and get to work, because that's when we're at our best, solving our problems.,1
We're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country.,1
I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.,1
We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end.,1
This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America.,0
Remember what Hillary Clinton said?,0
It is wrong.,1
She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.,0
And I don't care whether you are black or white.,1
It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police, charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes.,1
We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.,0
It's wrong, and we're going to do something about that.,1
And Donald Trump, whenever he's face with these issues says "well the answer to our problems is more law and order.",1
Energy reform is central to our plan as well,0
According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.,0
Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.,0
He doesn't tell you what he means by that, but it's kind of code for fear and division.,1
A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production.,0
According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will:,0
increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually,0
What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.,1
I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law, and everyone is respected by the law.,1
add over 500,000 new jobs annually,0
And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists.,1
increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years,0
increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades,0
increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years.,0
You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment.,1
Donald's always trying to say "oh, you know, she's going to repeal the second amendment.",1
What nonsense.,1
Absolute nonsense.,1
In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama ... creating countless more jobs in the process.,0
Finally, comes trade ... the foundation for everything,0
America's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year ... an enormous drag on growth.,0
Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate.,0
But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.,0
Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.,0
It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals.,0
The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
The verdict is in.,0
But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment, and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.,1
All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted ... every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.,0
And we're going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind.,1
Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.,0
I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America.,0
This includes the following steps:,0
I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers.,0
I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators ... and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.,0
Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this.,1
We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country.,0
There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out.,1
We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind.,1
And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise, which Donald doesn't agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage, I think it's finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.,1
I don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue.,1
I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card.,1
We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.,0
Well, I've always said, if that's playing the woman's card, deal me in, you got that right.,1
We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,0
Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States.,0
I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China.,0
But I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.,1
China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.,0
And we're going to have a big investments in new jobs, infrastructure jobs, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our ports, our airports, our water systems.,1
And we're going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities.,1
Put people to work, doing work that has a really productive purpose.,1
We're going to invest in more clean, renewable energy jobs, these are jobs that cannot be exported, they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.,1
Now it's fair to say "Ok, that sounds good, how are you going to do all that?",1
If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.,0
Ok, I'll tell you two things.,1
Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs.,0
According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.,0
First, I have said, and you can hold me to it, I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,00 a year.,1
You see, I come from the middle class.,1
We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.,0
Here is how the plan adds up,0
My dad never made anything near that, even in those dollars back in those days.,1
We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored.,0
This includes the childcare plan.,0
But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up.,1
Not the top down, that does not work for most Americans.,1
And so, secondly, I'm going where the money is.,1
Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.,0
The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years.,1
And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy?,1
That leaves around $800 billion dollars.,0
This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms.,0
It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself, to his family, to the wealthy, to corporations.,1
If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade ... again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.,0
If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit.,0
Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.,0
I just think that's a bad, bad idea.,1
This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country.,0
This is what our new future will look like,0
I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA ... and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.,0
We're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and we're going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again.,1
And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work.,0
And we're going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free.,1
We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.,0
Tuition-free for working and middle class families, and debt free for everybody else.,1
And if you're struggling with student debt, we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills, and get you out from under debt.,1
And we're going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.,1
American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.,0
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.,0
But I don't think that every young person needs to go college.,1
If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships. ,1
There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent, and I'm asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are, and what kind of future we want.,1
American hands will rebuild this nation ... and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation.,0
American workers will be hired to do the job.,0
I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other.,1
Now, that does not mean we have to agree about everything, of course not.,1
But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.,1
We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.,0
Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.,0
I don't think I have all the answers, I don't think anybody does.,1
When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America, I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia.,1
It wasn't one person creating our country, it was many people working together.,1
Think about every social movement, every economic advance, every university like this one, every achievement that you've made in your own life, somebody helped you.,1
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.,0
We Will Make America Strong Again.,0
And Will Make America Great Again.,0
Thank you, and God Bless!,0
You worked with somebody.,1
Look at this community.,1
Everybody working together, making Greenville really grow and thrive, making this university better and better every single year.,1
That is my experience of America, so here's what I hope you will do.,1
I hope you will get everybody you know, and yourselves , if you haven't voted yet, to vote early.,1
Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls.,1
Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America.,1
You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday.,1
He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington.,1
As he said yesterday, everything we've done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does.,1
Well I'll tell you what, I'm ready to grab that baton.,1
He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man.,1
But I've been practicing.,1
I spent four years working with him.,1
I call him my partner and my friend, and I am ready to defend and build on his progress, coming out of his eight years of the presidency.,1
So let's get out and vote, and let's vote for the kind of future that we want, the kind of country that we want.,1
Find your early voting location for the next three days, please, go take people there.,1
We will show once and for all, love trumps hate, thank you all.,1
You know, there's something special about this place.,1
And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in, an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called 'Rise Up.',1
And that is what Detroit is doing ... you are rising up!,1
And that is exactly what we're going to do in America.,1
We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.,1
I'm looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan.,1
I want to thank your senators, Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters.,1
I want to thank your members of Congress, Congressman John Conyers, Sandy Levin, Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell.,1
I want to thank your great mayor, Mayor Mike Duggan, and thank you.,1
Wayne County Executive Warren Evans.,1
Sheriff Benny Napoleon.,1
The president of the UAW, Dennis Williams.,1
Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine, former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here.,1
And to all who are present today.,1
And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter, Mark Cuban, could be here because ... he's not only a real billionaire ... he's actually shared his profits with his employees.,1
Now, are you ready to vote on Tuesday?,1
Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote?,1
Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief?,1
Did any of you see the three debates that we had?,1
Well, I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump, proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.,1
Now, he kept saying a lot of unusual things, didn't he?,1
And, you know, there's a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates, and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States.,1
And I did practice my composure.,1
People said to me, well, how did you do that?,1
The things he was saying.,1
And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you.,1
I said, well, I did practice.,1
And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me.,1
So I was ready.,1
But he would say, like, 'Well, what have you done for 30 years?',1
And you know, I don't want to brag.,1
But I do think it matters what you've done, and especially what you've done that maybe improves somebody else's life, right?,1
And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what we've been doing.,1
For example, as First Lady, I helped create the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers eight million kids.,1
And these are families that they're not poor families, they're working people, but they don't make enough money and they don't work for somebody who provides insurance, and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had.,1
I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf, and the doctor said, 'We're sorry, there's really nothing we can do for her.',1
But this mother, like many mothers I know, did not take that for an answer, right?,1
She got on the internet.,1
She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter, but they were expensive and she and her husband didn't have that kind of money and they didn't have insurance.,1
She was at her doctor's office and just so distraught, and the doctor said, 'Well, there's this new thing called the Children's Health Insurance Program.,1
Maybe you should look into it.',1
Turned out she was eligible.,1
She signed up.,1
She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have, by the way.,1
And when I was in North Carolina, I heard about her and I got to meet her, but more than that, I met her daughter, who talked to me and who just graduated from college ... because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.,1
I'll tell you what, that is how I judge my last 30 years.,1
Have I done something to help somebody else?,1
I am well aware of the blessings that I have had, and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward, make it possible for more families, more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.,1
And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11, so I know what can happen ... the evil and the hatred of terrorism.,1
I saw it.,1
And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger, not away from it ... our police, our firefighters, our EMTs.,1
And I'll tell you who else we got covered.,1
We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools, and I see one right out there who knows exactly what I'm talking about.,1
All across the city, people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger.,1
That was America at its best.,1
And don't ever forget what we are capable of being, who we are.,1
We are not afraid.,1
We are brave, courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.,1
As your Secretary of State, I went to 112 countries, negotiated ceasefires, reduced the threat of nuclear weapons, stood up for human rights and women's rights and worker rights and LGBT rights.,1
I'm telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can.,1
If I am honored to be your president, I will get up every day in that White House, and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.,1
I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against.,1
That's why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues, not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election, it is a choice between two very different visions for America.,1
I've got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America, I don't recognize the country he's talking about.,1
It is so dark, so divisive, so hateful.,1
That is not the America that I believe in.,1
I believe that we should have a confident, optimistic, inclusive vision of where we're going and how we're going to get there.,1
I love our country, and I believe in the American people.,1
And I think there's nothing we can't achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them.,1
You see, we believe in an America that is bighearted, not small-minded.,1
We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part.,1
And we believe America is great because America is good.,1
Never forget that.,1
If we lift each other up and not tear each other down, we can go even further.,1
And I believe with all my heart.,1
That's why the slogan of my campaign sums it up, that we are stronger together.,1
And so come next January 20th, America is going to have a new president.,1
I know ...,1
I know that ...,1
I know that a lot of people say that they want change.,1
Well, let me tell you this.,1
Change is inevitable.,1
There will be change.,1
The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? ,1
Are we going to build a stronger, fairer, better country or are we going to fear the future and each other?,1
I sure hope not.,1
That is not the America that I believe we are.,1
And so here is what I want to ask you to do.,1
I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors.,1
Michigan is one of these states that doesn't have early voting.,1
I've been all over the country going to states that are already voting.,1
In fact, I don't know.,1
About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states.,1
But Michigan votes on Tuesday.,1
And I imagine ...,1
I imagine there are ... some of you know people who say they're going to vote for Donald Trump.,1
Right?,1
I know.,1
I know.,1
I understand that.,1
I mean, I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before it's too late.,1
But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine, imagine January 20th, 2017.,1
And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol.,1
Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled, who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims, who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively.,1
Now, the truth is we really don't have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done, both in his career and in this campaign, tells you what could happen.,1
Now, Michelle Obama, who says so many wise and wonderful things, she said the presidency doesn't change who you are; it reveals who you are.,1
And I think we've seen who Donald Trump is.,1
Maya Angelou, another great American, Maya Angelou said, when someone shows you who he is, believe him the first time.,1
And if my opponent were to win, we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.,1
Just last year, he said again it wouldn't have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt.,1
What is he talking about?,1
I'm proud that President Obama saved the auto industry.,1
And I'm even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry just had its best year ever.,1
If Donald wins the election, we'd have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States.,1
We are a country founded on religious freedom.,1
That runs contrary to our Constitution.,1
We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair.,1
He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities.,1
He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field.,1
I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony, don't you?,1
Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins.,1
Decades ago, she was a hard-working nurse in New York City.,1
She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent.,1
But Donald Trump and his father, Fred, turned her away.,1
You see, whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments, their application was marked with a 'C,' C for colored.,1
And that didn't sit very well with Mae, so she went to the authorities, and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination.,1
And although they settled, they wouldn't change.,1
So the government had to take them back to court.,1
That's a pattern.,1
This is what happens time and time again with my opponent.,1
If he were to win, he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department.,1
If he doesn't respect all Americans now, how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?,1
He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution.,1
He doesn't seem to understand the rule of law, that we really are a nation of laws, not men.,1
Here's the latest example.,1
There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City.,1
It was called the Central Park Five.,1
Maybe some of you have heard of it.,1
There were five black and Latino kids, some as young as 14.,1
They were wrongfully convinced, and they were in prison where they spent years.,1
Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids.,1
And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime, Trump actually said they should still be in prison.,1
It doesn't matter if you're innocent.,1
If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up.,1
No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin, because that's exactly what Putin does to his people.,1
So we can't trust him with our Constitution.,1
We can't trust him to obey the rule of law.,1
He has shown us who he is.,1
Now we have to decide who we are.,1
So let me paint you a different picture.,1
Here is what we're going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.,1
We have three big challenges.,1
Number one, we got to get the economy working for everyone, not just those at the top.,1
Number two, we've got to keep our country safe, and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity.,1
Number three, we've got to bring our country together.,1
We have got to overcome these divides.,1
We have to heal our nation.,1
And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.,1
I have said repeatedly that we're going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back, it can lead to holding other people back.,1
We can't accept as normal what we're seeing across our country because of his campaign.,1
A church in Mississippi was burned this week.,1
Someone painted 'Vote Trump' on the side and then set it on fire.,1
We can't let ... we can't let that happen.,1
What happened in Flint, Michigan should not be normal or acceptable.,1
Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water.,1
Those are basics.,1
We've got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.,1
And it's important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody, that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II ... infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, clean, renewable energy technology.,1
Some people say we can't do that.,1
Well, I'm telling you, they're wrong.,1
They're wrong.,1
We have the best workers, the most productive workers.,1
We're going to give them more to work on, more products to produce.,1
And we're going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities.,1
And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America.,1
That means we're going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.,1
And we're going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers, no matter what zip code that child lives in.,1
And I want to start with our youngest kids, with pre-kindergarten programs.,1
And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers.,1
We've got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children.,1
And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.,1
It'll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other.,1
I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.,1
And that's what we're going to work for.,1
We're also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives.,1
This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent.,1
Have you seen he's starting to wear a camo hat now?,1
Really.,1
We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that we've got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them in the first place.,1
And while we create more safe communities, we want to invest in those communities.,1
I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done, one named Clinton, one named Obama.,1
And I want to be a really strong partner.,1
I'll compete a little with them.,1
I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support, the housing, and the jobs that you need.,1
But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer.,1
That's why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage, because people who work full time should not be left in poverty.,1
And isn't it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women?,1
This is not a women's issue.,1
If you have a wife, a mother, a daughter, or a sister who works, it's your issue.,1
It's a family issue.,1
And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare, paid family leave, equal pay for women, the other side accuses me of playing the women's card.,1
I'll tell you what, if standing up for equal pay is playing the women's card, then deal me in.,1
And one of the other big challenges we're going to take on ...,1
I am so excited about this.,1
I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues.,1
And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate.,1
So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university, you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125,000 a year.,1
And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you don't go into debt.,1
And for people who already have student debt, we're going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it.,1
And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.,1
Now, this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign, because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election.,1
I had a friend say to me the other day, 'People are just frustrated and angry.',1
I get that.,1
I understand that.,1
We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in '08 and '09.,1
Millions of people lost their jobs, millions lost their homes, family wealth was wiped out.,1
That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that.,1
I get it.,1
But I learned a long time ago from my late mother, anger is not a plan.,1
Right?,1
Be angry, vent about it, and then roll up your sleeves and get to work.,1
That's what I will do.,1
That's why we've put this all down.,1
It's on our website, hillaryclinton.com.,1
It's in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called 'Stronger Together.',1
Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable.,1
I want you, when I come back to Detroit, which I will do when I travel around Michigan, which I will do, I want you to say, 'Well, how's it going getting those new jobs started?,1
How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable?',1
I believe in making lists.,1
Maybe it's a women's thing.,1
My husband said ... once said to me one time, 'You have lists of your lists.',1
Well, I do because I want to know what we're going to get done and how we can make progress together.,1
And ultimately, this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids, and in my case now, my grandkids.,1
Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?",1
<i>Audience:</i> "Yes.",1
<i>Clinton:</i> "Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal?,1
I believe we can do this together.,1
My opponent at his convention said, 'I alone can fix it.',1
Well, no, nobody alone does anything.,1
When our founders met in Philadelphia, it wasn't one person creating our country.,1
It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers' rights and women's rights and LGBT rights.,1
None of them ... none of them were won by one person alone.,1
The American labor movement didn't happen because somebody one day said, 'I alone can make it happen.',1
It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in.,1
Barack Obama wasn't put into the White House by one person alone.,1
It took everybody working and organizing, and yes, voting.,1
That is how progress happens in America.,1
So really, it all comes down to you, my friends.,1
You have to vote.,1
Our progress is on the line.,1
Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line.,1
I'm ready to defend and build on the progress that we've made.,1
I'm proud I was a member of President Obama's cabinet.,1
I'm proud that ... he and I are friends.,1
But he knows and I know that American leadership, American presidents, it's like running a relay.,1
You do your very best, and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesn't drop to the ground or doesn't turn around and run back the way we came from, which is what my opponent is promising to do.,1
Now, I've told the President that when he hands off the baton that he's going to have to bend over.,1
He's a lot taller than I am.,1
But I'm excited about what we can do.,1
I know this has been a tough campaign.,1
I've got people coming up to me saying they've got migraines they never had before.,1
They have stomachaches that they don't know what they're going to do with.,1
I get it.,1
It has been in many ways a really tough campaign, but I'll tell you what.,1
Michigan, you can make the difference.,1
All I'm asking you is talk to your friends, talk to your family, talk to your coworkers, talk to everybody.,1
If you have time to volunteer, go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text 'join,' J?o-i-n, to 47246.,1
Because when your children ... and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today.,1
When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line, I want you to be able to say, 'I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.',1
An America where we build bridges, not walls.,1
And where we prove, once and for all, that love trumps hate.,1
Let's get to work.,1
Thank you.,1
Thank you, Detroit.,1
Thank you, Michigan.,1
God bless you.,1
I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction, and for his service to our nation.,1
I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote.,1
I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program.,1
In particular, let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown, such a great senator, my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan, State Representative John Boccieri, State Representative Kathleen Clyde, and let me thank the Kent Clarks, the acapella group that sang during the pre-program! ,1
My friends, we are about to enter the final week of this election, so I wanted to come back to Ohio, one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country, to talk about what's at stake in this election.,1
But let me start with this.,1
I'm sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go.,1
That's a good question! ,1
And first of all, for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and as I've said, I'm not making excuses.,1
I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means, they should look at them.,1
And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year.,1
There is no case here.,1
And they said it wasn't even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this. ,1
Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America.,1
And did any of you see the debates?,1
Well, I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country.,1
And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said.,1
I am running against a man who says he doesn't understand why we can't use nuclear weapons.,1
He actually said, 'Then why are we making them?',1
And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons.,1
Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia.,1
Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East. ,1
And if you're telling yourself he'll surround himself with smart people who'll stop these crazy ideas, remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy, Donald Trump said he didn't need to consult because he said and I quote, 'I have a very good brain.',1
He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do.,1
No, he does not.,1
And of course, the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putin's allies. ,1
So, in these last days, let's not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future.,1
I started saying last June, I believe, that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief.,1
And I've got to tell you, I did not take any pleasure in saying that.,1
I have known, I have known for years now people who ran for President, Republicans and Democrats.,1
And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats, but I never doubted their fitness to serve.,1
Donald Trump is different.,1
That's as serious as it gets. ,1
So today, I want to talk about our national security.,1
Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th, we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions.,1
And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election.,1
And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace?,1
How do you handle a crisis?,1
And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? ,1
We'll start with nuclear weapons.,1
Now, I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering, but I don't think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair.,1
When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should, and I quote, 'not have his finger on the button,' then this is a topic that can't be avoided.,1
And as I've said, Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons.,1
He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world, the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that can't be stopped.,1
And when a few more countries go nuclear, their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well. ,1
One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program.,1
But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesn't seem to bother Donald Trump.,1
'Good luck, enjoy yourselves, folks,' was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia. ,1
I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people.,1
These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. ,1
To talk so casually, so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling.,1
President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared, and this is a quote from President Reagan, 'some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us.',1
That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age. ,1
So what would he think about Donald Trump, who says he wants to be, and I quote, 'unpredictable' about using the most powerful weapons ever produced?,1
And here's the thing with nuclear weapons ... as Bruce told you, when the President gives the order, that's it.,1
There's no veto for Congress, no veto by the Joint Chiefs.,1
The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire.,1
And that can take as little as four minutes.,1
That's why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal. ,1
Earlier you heard from one of them, Bruce Blair, and his story is worth remembering.,1
In 1973, Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana.,1
His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order.,1
Then one night in October, as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East, the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war.,1
Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world, Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty.,1
They unlocked the safe, took out the launch codes and the keys, and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them.,1
Then they waited for the final order from the President.,1
Thankfully, it never came.,1
But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump, and sees his hair-trigger temper, and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night.,1
As I've said many times, a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. ,1
And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis?,1
We've seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation.,1
When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter.,1
When he's challenged in a debate.,1
When he sees a protestor at a rally.,1
When he's confronted with his own words.,1
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.,1
Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesn't want to hear, racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet.,1
And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin. ,1
Now thankfully, he's never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country.,1
But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself.,1
Donald is a New Yorker, and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruz's attacks in a debate.,1
And then he invoked the days after 9/11, when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other.,1
And I couldn't agree more.,1
That's why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11.,1
After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell, he called in to a New York TV station.,1
And even on that horrible day, when thousands of people lost their lives, he couldn't stop himself from pointing out that now, because the towers had fallen, a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan.,1
What kind of a person brags at a moment like that?,1
I'll tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief. ,1
For me, I take this very personally, my friends.,1
Because I was one of New York's senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11.,1
He and I were on the ground the very next day, meeting with the Governor, the Mayor, emergency officials.,1
And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero.,1
The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see.,1
Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers.,1
They had all lost friends.,1
In a makeshift command center, we were briefed on the damage, and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York, and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe. ,1
That's what I did for eight years as a senator.,1
I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed.,1
And I think it's important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that.,1
Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted.,1
They happen.,1
I'll tell you a quick story.,1
It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration.,1
And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room.,1
And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table, and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side.,1
And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration. ,1
So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs, we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision.,1
It really matters what your experience has, what your values are, whether you can be counted on to make that decision.,1
You learn a lot about people in moments like that.,1
And as I sat there with the pressure on, having to think through in my own head, how we evaluated this intelligence, how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington. ,1
We made the decision to go forward, obviously.,1
Some of you might have been there.,1
But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there.,1
So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis, who would you trust?,1
Who will listen to good advice, keep a level head and make the right call?,1
Because that's the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief. ,1
Now let's get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us.,1
Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?,1
Now this may seem like an easy question.,1
If you got it on an exam, I think you'd be able to answer it.,1
But apparently it's hard for Donald.,1
He has picked fights with our friends.,1
I mean the President of Mexico, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, pretty much the entire nation of Japan... and he even picked a fight with the Pope.,1
And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership.,1
He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square.,1
Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia. ,1
He has called NATO, quote, 'obsolete.',1
Obsolete?,1
NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world.,1
And it's based on something called Article V, which says, 'An attack on one is an attack on all.',1
And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11.,1
We still have NATO allies fighting side by side, working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan.,1
They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden.,1
Now we're supposed to tell them we won't have their back? ,1
And by the way...right now, our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe.,1
They're hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere.,1
And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops, they share the risks and burdens.,1
Now they're moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression. ,1
Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City ... hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe.,1
And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China, which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail.,1
But maybe that's the point.,1
Because what's most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider ... is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. ,1
As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it, and I quote her, 'We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States.',1
Michael Morell, who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here, has said that Putin is manipulating Donald.,1
Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB.,1
He knows he can use flattery to get into Donald's head -- to make Donald the Kremlin's puppet.,1
And It seems to be working. ,1
Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants, from Ukraine to Syria and beyond.,1
He's even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama.,1
And it gets worse.,1
The U.S. intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government, which means Putin, is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election. ,1
So ask yourself, why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President?,1
Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him, or the fact that he's promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies, or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin?,1
Since Donald still won't release his tax returns, and don't hold your breath, we don't know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing. ,1
And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country.,1
A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election.,1
That should scare everyone, Democrat, Republican, and Independent.,1
With the election just eight days away, this can't wait any longer.,1
Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates.,1
The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election. ,1
When you step back and take it all in, it's no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump, because he would be ... in their words ... 'the most reckless President in American history.',1
It's no surprise that not a single former President, Secretary of State or Defense, or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him.,1
It's no surprise that Bob Gates, who served eight presidents over 50 years, Democrats and Republicans alike, has said Trump is, and I quote, 'beyond repair... stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government... temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform... unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.',1
I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election.,1
Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country, our children and our grandchildren.,1
And who is best to do that.,1
So make no mistake, that really is what is on the ballot this year.,1
It's not just my name and Donald Trump's name.,1
It's our future.,1
Our security.,1
Our values.,1
It's who we are as a country. ,1
Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart.,1
But the good news is: There's another vision for America.,1
Instead of dark and divisive, it's hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified.,1
And it is big-hearted, not small-minded.,1
It's about lifting people up, not tearing each other down.,1
It's a vision that says, as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together. ,1
Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good.,1
That is Democrats, Republicans and Independents.,1
Because we believe in an America where women are respected.,1
An America where veterans are honored, parents are supported, and workers are paid fairly ... an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.... an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values... where everyone counts and everyone has a place.,1
Where the American dream is big enough for everyone. ,1
This goes way beyond policies and partisanship.,1
We're talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century.,1
About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls, kids and grandkids.,1
It turns out, if you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics, eventually you hit something hard and true.,1
A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans ... basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency. ,1
That's something to defend ... and to build on.,1
And, in the end, that's what this election is all about.,1
Here in Ohio, you can make the difference.,1
Early voting has already begun.,1
So now is the time.,1
Every phone call you make, every door you knock, moves us forward.,1
You can go to hillaryclinton.com, and sign up to volunteer.,1
Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same. ,1
Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time.,1
This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States.,1
And it truly is in your hands, as it should be.,1
When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016, when everything was on the line, I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better, stronger, fairer America.,1
A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us.,1
Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future! ,1
So let's come together, let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us.,1
And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate.,1
Thank you.,1
