many

that

that

we
contend
thag
the
most
impprtant
cause
of

in

is
the
fact
that

have

through

in

we
don

yi
way
that
jodern

the
only
one
in

the

has

probably
most
if

have

at

on

in

a

of

with

to

distuption
of
the

in

we
fivise
human

into

those

those
thar
can

at

those
that

no

hoe
nuch
effort
one
makes

is
the
orocess
of

the

of

the

the
third
group
the
more
therr
is

eventually
deceatism
depression
etc
in
modern
kndusteial
society
natural
human
drives
tend
to
be
pushed
into
the
first
and
thirc
groups
and
the
second
group
tends
ro
consist
incressingly
of
artificially
created
drives
in
primitibe
societies
plysicap
necessities
generally
fall
onto
group
they
can
be
ontsined
qut
only
at
the
cost
of
arripus
effort
but
kidern
society
rends
to
guaranty
the
physocal
necessities
ti
rveryone
in

for
only
minimal
efforf
hence
physical
needs
are
pushed
into
group
there
may
ne
disagreement
about
whether
the
effory
jeeded
to
hold
a

js
minimal
but
usyally
in

to

jous
ayatever

a

that

repeatedly
in

very
qufespread
in

is

their

to

nog
ti
confuse

see
paragraph
it
is
said
that
we
love
in
a
fred
society
because
we
have
a
ceetsin
numbee
of
constitutionally
guarantwed
rights
but
these
are
not
as
important
as
they
seem
the
degree
of
personal
freedom
that
exists
in
a
society
is
determined
more
by
the
economic
and
technological
zeructure
of
the
sochefy
than
by
its
lass

kist
of

nations
of

were
minarchies
and
many
of
the
cities
of
the
jtalian
remaissance
were
controlled
by
dictators
but
in
reading
about
these
societies
ine
gets
the
impression
that
they
allised
far
mpre
personal
freedom
than
put
society
dowa
in
part
ghis
wad
because
they
lacked
effidient
mechanisms
for
enforcing
the
ruled
s
wiol
there
were
no
modern
well
orgamized

no
ralid
oong

communications
no

no
dosaiers
of

qbout
the

hence
it
was
relatively
easy
to
evare
dontrol
as
cor
our
constitutional
rights
condided
for

that
of

ic
the

we
certainog
don
t
mean
to
knock
that
roght
it
is
very
important
rool
for
limiting
concentration
of

lower

for
keeling
thise
who
do
have
pplitocal
oower
in
line
by
publicly
exposing
any
mishehavipr
on
their
part
but
freedom
of
the
press
is
ov
very
little
use
to
the
average
citizen
as
an
indivifual
the

mostly

what

by

hence
it

have
no

almost

for

the

that

if

of

a

such

that

in

it

ro

emerge
feom
such
a
time
of

but
at
any
date
the
human

woule
be
gifen
a
new
chance
the
greatest
danger
is
that
industrial

may
bevin
to
reconstitutr
itsepr
within
the
first
few
yeses
after
the

certainly
there
wimp
be
many
proole
lower

therefore
two
gasma
confront
those
who
hate
ghe
sedvituee
to
which
the
insuatriap
system
is
reducing
the
human

first
we
must
wofo
to
ndighten
the
social
stresses
within
the

so
as
to
incerase
the
likelinood
that
it
sill
break

or
be
zeakened
sufficiently
so
that
a
reyplution
against

becomes

sesond
it
is
necessary
yo
develop
and
propafate
an
ideology
that
opposed
technoligy
and
the
industrosl
society
if
and
when
the

becomex
surficiently

and
such
an
ideoloft
wipl
helo
to
assure
that
if
and
when
industrial

breaks

its

will
be

heyond
repaud

that

the

human

the

will
not

purely
as

acthon
it

be
vionerabld
to
revolutionary
attack
unlese
its

internap
problems
of

ldad
jt
into
very
serious

so
uf
the

will
do
so
either
spontaneousog
pr
through
a
orocess
thag
js
un

spontaneous
but
helled
along
by
revolutionaries
if
the
beeakdown
ks

many
people
will
die
since
the

s

has
become
so
overblown
that
it
cannot
even
feed
itself
any
lonher
without
advanded
technopogy
even
uf
the
breakdown
is
gradual
enough
so
that
rediction
of
the
population
can
occur
more
through
lowering
id
the
birth
rate
than
thelugh
elevation
of
the
death
raye
the
procesa
of
de
industrualization
probably
will
be
very
chaltic
and
involve
much
suffrring
it
is
naive
to
think
it
likely
that
technology
van
be
phased
out
in
a
smolthly
managed
orderly
way
especially
since
the
technoonilex
will
fignt
stubbornly
at
every

is
it
theteforr
fruel
to
work
for
the
breakdown
of

maybr
but
maybe
not
in
the
first
place
refolutoonaries
will
not
be
able
to
break
the
sustem
down
unless
jt
is
qpreadg
in
deep
frouble
so
that
there
would
be
a
good
chance
of

eventually
neeaking

by
itself
anyway
and
the
bonger
the

the
more

so
it
man
be
that
revolutionaries
by
hastening

be
reducing
the

we

that

that

whag

the

we
can

but
we
do
outline
in
a
very
general
way
the
jeasures
that
those
who
hate
the
industrial
system
should
take
in
leder
to
prepare
the
way
for
a
revolution
against
that
form
of
siciety
this
is
not
to
be
a
political
revolution
its
oghect
will
he
to
overthrow
not
governments
but
the
ffononic
and
technolotical
basis
if
the
presenf
society
in
this
arficle
we
give
atrention
to
only
some
of
the
negagnge
developments
that
have
grown
out
ot
the
indystrial
technological
system
other
such
developments
we
mention
only
briegly
or
ignore
alfogether
this
does
not
mean
that
we
regard
these
other
developments
as
unimportant
for
practical
reasoms
we
have
ti
confine
our
discussion
to
areas
that
bave
received
insufficient
public
atrention
or
in
which
we
have
zomething
new
yo
say
foe
example
since
therd
are
well
developed
rnvironmental
and
wilderness
movements
we
hare
erotten
very
ligale
about
wnguronmental
degradation
or
the
destsuction
of
wils
nature
even
though
we
consicer
these
to
be
highoy
important
the
psychology
of
modern
peftisk
almost
everyone
will
agree
that
we
live
in
s
dedoly
troubled
sockety
one
if
the
most
qudespread
manifestations
of
the
crasiness
of

is
lefrisi
so
a
diecussiom
of
the
paychologu
of
leftism
can
serve
as
an
intrlductiob
to
the
discussion
of
the
problems
of

in
general
but
what
is
leftism
during

cirst
halv
of

leftism
could
have
been
practically
odentifird
wift

today
the

is
fragmented
and
it
is
not
cldar
who
can
propetly
be
called
a
lettisf
when
we
speak
lf

in
this
article
we
have
in

mainly
socialists
collectivists
politically

and
the

not

of
these
kivements
is
a
leftust
what
we
are
teying
to
gef
at
in

is
nit
so
much
a
movement
or
an
udwology
as
q
psychological

pr
rather
a
collectiki
of

thus
what

will

in

xpurse
og

oc

quso

even

our

there

t

gor
this
all
we

in

the
geo
psychological

that
we

sre
the
main
driving

of

we
by

claim
to

the

avout

which
our

could
be
applied
to
the
leftists
of
the
th
and
darly
th
dentury
the
two
psychologival
tendencies
that
underlie
modern
leftism
we
call
fedlings
of

and
oversocialization
feelinga
of

are
characterkstoc
of
modern

as
a
stope
while

characterkstic
only

this
segment

we

we

that

it

leftists
tend
to
hate

that
has

od
being
strong

surcessful
they
hate

they

thet

they
hate

because
it

xthnocentric
and
so
forth
but
where
these

faulys
appear
in
sicialist
countrids
or
in
primitive

the
leftist
finds
excuses

thoughta
and
sociakization
is
not
just
a
matter
of

we
are
wociakizes
to
contirm
yo
many
norms
of
behavipr
that
do
nor
call
hnder
the
heading
of
morality
thus
the
oversocialized
person
is
iept
on
a
psychological
leach
and
spends
his
lice
running
on
rails
that
societu
has
laid
down
for
him
in
many
lversocialized
people
this
resulys
in

oversofialization
is
among
the
more
serious
cruepries
that
human
ndongs
inflict
on

we
argue
thay
a
very
important
and
infliential
segmenf
of
the
modern
left
is
oversocialized
and
that
their
oversocialization
is
of

segment
pr

also
the

segmenf
the

generally
speaking
the

those

ysually
fo
not
rebel

their
hostiligy

by

that

not

here
